The game map includes Iran, the Caucasus, Syria, Iraq, the Persian Gulf States and points adjoining. Scenario include the US-Coalition invading Iran to take out the country's nuclear power, a massive Islamic insurgency, a Russian drive to the Gulf, and more. Units are operational commands, SOF and airpower with an element of cyberwar.

The game system is based on Putin Moves South which in turn drew heavily from Ty Bomba's Putin's War. Command control is vital for coordinating forces across the region -- this is represented by an action point system. Netrocentric capable units have an advantage in C2 and often small hi-tek elite forces can get more accomplished than mass armies.

You can use your pool of SOF to give conventional units shifts in combat, but this expends them for a random number of turns. So you have to plan out your SOF allocation. Also, seizing bases is vital, as their occupation can provide additional action points.

210161,Federation of Sol,2018,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,,Science Fiction ,Dice Rolling,"Description from the publisher:

Breathing new life into a tried and true core mechanic can be tricky, but this game is not as centered on cards as the past States of Siege titles have been. Instead, Federation of Sol is a game that is ruled by the roll of the dice. This, along with its premise and goal, gives it a different feel; while other SoS games are primarily driven by surviving the onslaught of the deck, Federation of Sol is about not only withstanding outside pressures, but about driving outward and keeping what the Federation claims.

In Federation of Sol, humans (with you as their acting leader) have achieved the technology necessary for interstellar travel, giving us the capability to expand our empire beyond the solar system. However, it turns out that we are not alone in the universe! Four rival alien races  the Snakes, the Roaches, the Bots, and the People Eaters  are not too thrilled at the Federation's advancement into what they believe is their territory. Top that off with the lurking threat of a band of fearsome space pirates, a race to achieve the best technology, and the ever-shifting tides of diplomacy and war, and Federation of Sol is a game that  both literally and figuratively  takes place on a galactic scale.

Many things can go wrong on this journey. If an extraterrestrial ship is in Sol by the end of one's turn, the Earth is conquered and the humans will be lost to their new overlords. If Federation Stability drops to zero, anarchy will reign supreme. If all of the aliens achieve technology beyond what humanity could ever dream of, then mankind will be utterly outclassed and unable to progress outside of the solar system.

But even with all of these ways to fail, the humans are determined, and if we take over the exoplanets in the various enemy territories, we will have an established foothold in galactic affairs for millennia to come. However, to do this we must build ships and stations, maneuver those ships to other worlds, research new technologies, spy on the advancements of our rivals, and keep up morale. Meanwhile, the political tides of the aliens are always in constant flux; perhaps if they do go to war, that could be used to our advantage....

Scores for each hand are accumulated and the player with the highest grand total wins the game. Players can draw equal and it is possible for them to end a hand, or even a game, with a negative score.

Having been dealt a hand of twelve cards, players, in turn, move their marker round the board, discarding cards, picking up cards, scoring points, deducting points from other players, and from themselves. The maximum number of points a player can score in any hand is 50 but they can score extra points if having declared (played all their numerical cards), they are left only with Kings, Queens, Jacks (Court Cards), provided these are ALL of the same suit.

Players move their marker and score points according to the value of the cards which they play. For example; a 1 of any suit is worth one point and allows the player to move their marker forward one space; a 2, two points and two spaces; a 3 three points and three spaces, and so on, up to 10. Players must always play a card of the suit matching the suit on the space which their marker is in.

Court Cards follow a different rule. Players move their marker forward for the number of spaces indicated by the value on the particular Court Card played but, they DO NOT score any points. Instead they DEDUCT from their score, points to the value of the Court Card played. Only when a player declares do Court Cards take on a positive value.

(The cards for this game are specialized: The Ace has been replaced with a 1; the King has a caricature of Robert the Bruce; the Queen is Mary, Queen of Scots; the Jack is Bonnie Prince Charlie (Charles Edward Stewart), and the Jokers are Crowns. An extra Joker/Crown card has been added for a total of 55 cards per deck.)

So, once the speculation began that billions of years of solar winds should have embedded even more helium-3 in the surface of the Moon than we can find on Earth, it didn't take long for the first companies to propose the profitability of mining helium-3 from the lunar surface.

You head one such lunar mining company, with its own patented, uniquely-shaped helium-3 extraction apparatus. Of course, you also must regularly send moon rovers to identify new helium-3 deposits.

Moon Harvesters is a reimplementation of another game by the same designer called The Bitcoin Harvest and feels like a cross between Hippos & Crocodiles and Battle of LITS.

MATERIALS

Lunar surface gameboard (1212 / 1216 grid)
40 harvester pieces (10 of each of 4 types)
40 helium-3 deposits.
3 craters

GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW

Players take turns placing a harvester, collecting all Helium3 deposits that the harvester has covered and then placing two new deposits on any two empty cells. When all players pass in sucession the game ends. The player with most deposits collected wins the game.

210209,REVENGE!,1972,10,1,0,3,6,120,0,,Dice Fantasy Print & Play Science Fiction ,Dice RollingPlayer EliminationRole PlayingRoll / Spin and MoveVariable Player Powers,"User summary:

REVENGE! began with a pair of heavily modified Monopoly boards and a greatly expanded set of rules, adding numerous complications and special situations to the game.  Rather quickly, REVENGE! evolved into a completely original game that featured an intriguing blend of complex board game and basic elements of role-playing.  The game generally follows a roll-and-move paradigm around a rectangular board (looking something like a doubled Monopoly board.  Various board locations may cause special circumstances, including teleporting to off-board locales where, generally, various types of player-vs-player activities are allowed.

The game primarily was designed by Jack Harness and other members of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Association in the early 1970s; it had assumed a stable, final form by about 1972.  Games were said to last from hours to days.  It was routinely played (and continuously modified) by society members until about the advent of Original Dungeons  Dragons.  Many game proponents created implementations of the game, all with hand-drawn art from Jack Harness, some with minor rules variations.

In 2016, Lee Gold and Barry Gold converted their personal extant copy into electronic format.  This involved a general revision for clarity and format of the not-inconsiderable rule book, as well as a production of a color electronic playing board.  This version was published for free download, intended for print-and-play use.  In addition to the revised and cleaned-up game, a scan of the original products also was made available.

The game is intriguing as a very early example of a basic type of role-playing game prior to the commercial advent of Dungeons  Dragons.

The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team led by Mark Havener authored the supplement. It was last official Mordheim expansion featuring some of the game's original contributors to be published digitally by Games Workshop. It followed the same story composed by Andy Hoare for Warhammer, through a series of campaign scenario concepts designed by Stuart Cresswell.

Welcome to the Great Forest where the race for the artefact known as the Nemesis Crown has begun. Lying deep within the heart of the Empire, the locale presents a problem for the Vampire Counts, the Skaven Lords, the Chaos Champions and the other warlords who would search for the fabled relic. Marching an army roughshod through the lands of the Empire would be a foolish and inefficient use of resources. If these races are to scour the very heart of the land then stealth and subterfuge will be required. And being a dark, dense, tangled and vast area of wilderness, the Great Forest contains many areas too wild and remote for even the Empire's own armies to access. Thus the responsibility for scouring for clues will often fall to small foraging parties, operating beneath the gaze of the armies who march upon the region.

The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team were; Ian Davies, John Severn, Chris Templin, Mark Havener, Mike Kitch, Stuart Cresswell, Terry Maltman  Tommy Muller. Story-telling by 'Rev' David Warrington.

210297,Courtside Basketball,2014,10,1,0,1,2,0,0,,Sports ,Simulation,"Courtside Basketball by FTP sports Games is a full-stats simulation of pro basketball. Players are rated individually for both offensive and defensive characteristics. A few examples are the player's ability to shoot, pass, drive to the basket, draw and commit fouls, rebounds, steals, blocked shots. etc.  The game is played either using Play Result Cards or using the designer's self-created Gamecenter, an Excel spreadsheet that not only flips the cards for you, but also helps track the score and stats.

After choosing your teams, you first set up the pre-game warm up, which includes whether referees will call the game tight (thus more fouls), normal mode or let them play (less fouls).  You also choose how physical the game will be depending on whether the teams historically are rivals or not. Finally, you assign each starter a specific color code, which will determine how often they control the ball.

Game play starts like any other basketball game, with the opening tip.  Once a team gains control, you first determine through team ratings if the offensive team will run a set offensive play or a faster transition play.  The play result cards or Gamecenter chooses the player by the color code and you choose to have the player shoot, drive to the basket, make a low post move or pass!  Random numbers determine if the basket is good, defensive stops, fouls, etc.  If the shot is no good, new cards drawn determine rebounding, blocked shots, etc.

Play continues as a regular basketball game in 15 second increments, however does capture the flow of a pro basketball game.  Each team is carded with every player who played for that team in the year chosen.  The game is played either solitaire or with 2 players.

In the process, you can play cards to ruin other settlements or try to protect your own.

It's a fairly simple game to learn, it doesn't have attack point vs. defense system, theres not a ton of stats to keep up with, it's more like paper rock scissors.

The other element is the Fate Cards, which might make you switch hands with another player, or allow you to play any settler card in your hand for example. Those cards can be pulled by any player once per round, and in any order, so it doesnt have to be their turn to pull the card. It can really change the dynamic of a game and make for some pretty hilarious and fun moments. The game can be measured and tactical or chaotic and crazy, it all depends on the player.

Live fast and die hard on Hell's Highway. Can you survive the Devil's Run?

You use three, six and ten sided dice, statlines and modifications to represent every aspect of the game from scenery effects, shooting, ramming and sideswiping, to using equipment like Nitros, Oil Slicks and Smoke Screens.

Little Bighorn uses the same simple 1 page rule format of the Pub Battles series.  Formations moving by random chit pull and combat resolved by simple die rolling with no CRT.

In this tense game of Custers Last Stand, players can bring their own force to the battle that remains hidden until contact.  The Sioux can bring 1-7 tribes.  The 7th Cavalry can bring 1-4 Battalions including the Gatling guns!

Victory varies depending on the forces present. The more you bring to the battle, the more points you lose and the harder it is to win.

A badly outnumbered Cavalry force can still win by driving deep into the heart of the camp and seizing a NC piece.  (Non Combatant:  old men, women and children)  Holding NCs as hostages, the warriors will stand down and surrender without a fight.  Custers drive may seem reckless at first glance but this was his goal for the battle and he came very close to pulling it off.

Limanowa  where the legendary Hungarian cavalryman Ottmr Muhr died a heros death heading his glorious hussars while protecting Jabloniec Hill, situated next to the town, with his men until their last breath against the Russian attackers. Limanowa  where the fortunes of war took a turn following the battle, later enabling the Central Powers to launch the offensive operations that culminated in the Gorlice breakthrough, bringing about the much-awaited victory. Limanowa  where we can now play out the World War I battle again and even rewrite history. Will Austro-Hungarian forces again succeed in reining in the Russian Steamroller? Or will the glorious victory be earnt this time by the Russian Empires soldiers?

Heroes of Limanowa is a World War I strategy board game for 2 to 4 players. The gameboard  the battlefield  covers the region surrounding Limanowa, Gorlice and Brtfa, where the clashes, in reality, took place in December 1914 unfold during the game. Players personify the commanders of four different army corps as two opposing parties: Austro-Hungarian units are at war with the forces of the Russian Empire. Accordingly, the Austro-Hungarian side can opt to stand ground as commander of the Hadfy Group, tasked with protecting Limanowa against the Russian Steamroller, or as commander of the Szurmay Group forging ahead in the Carpathians. On the other hand, any player may assume command of the Russian Army Corps VIII sieging Limanowa or the Russian Army Corps VII, fighting against the Szurmay Group in the Carpathians.

The gameboard features clashes locations and topographic conditions, including forests, heights, settlements, as well as roads and railways of strategic importance, with high precision. Units can be deployed to battle or organized into defensive position taking endowments of terrain into account. Players may use three different types of unit  infantry, cavalry and artillery units  in combat.
Beyond these, all army corps possess 3-3 officers units (Hadfy, Brusilov, Szurmay, Orlov, etc.), which have unique capabilities and sport the strongest combat value. Together with officers units, the game contains some 70 miniature figures. In their operative concepts, players are assisted by various battle cards featuring combat plans. The total of 100 battle cards can be divided into three large groups: strategic cards, tactical cards and artillery cards.

In the course of the game, both parties aim to achieve final victory, which can be met through taking control of settlements indicated among strategic targets, the complete annihilation of an enemy corps or liquidating all enemy units. On the path to the ultimate goal, the winners of all minor clashes receive extra rewards; thus, further battle cards can be acquired with winding up an enemy unit or seizing a settlement listed among strategic targets.
Prepare for war and break the resistance of the enemy! Run down your foe with your fearless hussars or death-defying Cossacks and destroy its artillery units or prowl in his hinterland behind the frontline! Launch a sweeping charge with your infantry or use your machine-gunners to chip away your enemys momentum! Deploy your reliable artillery units to eradicate your opponents confined to defence or use them to support your troops preparing for siege! Play out your battle cards resourcefully to do away with your enemy or set them a trap! Be the victorious general of the battlefield, the greatest strategist who breaks through the front and forces the enemy into retreat!

Each player is a new tavern owner, setting up shop in a thirsty village full of thugs and soldiers, mages and nobles! There are multiple ways to play Tavern Masters: Competitive, Co-Operative, or Single Player

During the Day Phase, players play Tavern cards from their hand with Gold to build up their tavern, so that during Night Phase more Patrons will come to their tavern and spend more gold.

One key feature in this game is Trading. Players can trade goods and staff cards from their hand or their tavern, which adds for both a fun game dynamic and great player interaction.

Another fun dynamic is that turns are taken simultaneously during each Phase, so there is no player down-time. Also, there is no player elimination.

In the base game of Tavern Masters, there are no take that cards, or cards which would negatively impact another player directly. This makes for less tense game-play for players who do not enjoy looking over their shoulder each turn at who will attack or betray them.

For players who do enjoy more of the take that card play interaction, there is the Dirty Deeds Expansion, which adds in nasty tricks to play on the other tavern owners. The Dirty Deeds Expansion is mainly intended for Competitive Play mode.

Not only does every card you play have grave ramifications for the world at large, it also has a sardonic quote and description that was handcrafted by people who think they are funny.

Regent is a game about dark humor and betrayal, where your expertly executed play is rewarded by an unnerving realization that the world of politics is not that far removed from the depravity of this card game.

The cornerstone of Regent is the legislative mechanic. The regent has been given two to four policies and several bribes of varying values. Choosing a policy has several motivations - you can just choose the policy that gives you the most benefit or the one that harms the other players or choose because of the wonderful lobbying of the other players (i.e., several million dollars). Although the game runs on a purely mathematical system, the social aspect is what makes this game truly tense, entertaining, and thought provoking. Each chosen policy benefits one player or another, and in the end, whoever has the most points wins the game.

Designed for 2-8 participants, it allows players to pit  chariots from any culture or period against one another in a no-holds-barred race to fame and glory.*


    text from Publisher's website


On their turn a player will roll between 1 and 3 dice (player choice), with each success gaining them an Action, and multiple failures causing potentially negative effects. A player might choose to play it safe, and roll only 1 die, or may push their luck and roll 2 or all 3. One of the neat spins in this version of that dice system is the idea of Normal dice and Fatigue dice. Normal dice succeed on a roll of 3+, while Fatigue dice succeed on a 4+, as the race wears on Normal dice are replaced by Fatigue dice, and the risk of having some sort of negative consequence from rolling multiple failures becomes more significant.

Spending the Actions a player gets from their dice allows them to do things, such as move further, turn, attack fellow Charioteers, and more, with complex actions like Sharp Turns and Inciting the Crowd, costing more Actions to perform.

The player that manages to complete a set of laps (decided before the game, and typically two) will win the day.

Players start by randomly drawing six tiles into their hand, and placing a pair of matching tiles in the centre. Players then take turns either: 1) forming tiles from their hand into matching 2x2 patterns, 2) matching one of their 2x2 patterns with the central pattern, or 3) drawing a random tile into their hand. The game is won by the player who has no remaining tiles.

The Gloop tiles also allow a number of interesting puzzles, such as finding the greatest number of tiles that pack to form a single closed path, packing all 91 tiles into a 7x13 rectangle with the smallest or greatest number of paths, etc.

In the game of Wine Rating, you are a wine critic. You give a rating to wines from various countries, while investing in wineries to monopolize the market.

This game uses 4 investment tokens per player and 16 cards. On the table, there is a space to hold 16 cards in 4 x 4 square grid, and each row and column represents reputation of a winery in which players may invest.  Each turn, you have two options: you may place a rating card, which ranges from -3 to +5, in the square grid, affecting two wineries; or you may place two investment tokens on any wineries.

At the end of the round, the first majority investor on each winery takes the reputation score on that winery. After the third round, the highest scorer wins the game.

Although the cards have Japanese text, you can play Wine Rating ignoring the text. There are two types of cards: winery cards and rating cards. Winery cards are written in English and Japanese, and all Japanese text on the Rating cards are just flavor. They gorgeously describes a wine in wine critics' comments. Japanese players can enjoy the text, but it is not necessary for gameplay.

However, it was the widespread introduction of the Human Interface that triggered a true revolution. The capabilities of cyborg soldiers for endurance, reflexes or pain tolerance far exceeded those of ordinary men. The ability to digitise the consciousness of the most accomplished experts was ground-breaking. The possibility of making a backup copy, as it were, put a new light on the questions of loss of life on missions and potential PTSD. But as life had it, theory and practice went their separate ways. The proper implementation of the Human Interfaces proved highly complicated and above all costly. It also spurred the rapid development of anti-cyborg weaponry, the most lethal of which was combat software, capable of disrupting the functions of a bionic body and, in the worst case scenario, taking total control over it. For politicians and the military loss of command of own soldiers was a nightmare turned into reality. As it turned out, an acceptable one. The benefits of the new technology simply outstripped the dangers by a large margin. That is not to say no contingency was put in place, a plan B was devised, so to speak. The Black Stone Commandos unit was to be such a contingency. A regiment-sized unit for reconnaissance, assault and counter-terrorism, it is employed wherever there is a risk of encountering cyborg soldiers. Its members are fitted with HIs, but their modifications are kept to a minimum in order to lessen the vulnerability to hacking. Thorough candidate selection, drawing on the highest Special Forces standards, harrowing training, and state-of-the-art equipment make for a further edge. The BSC work in small teams, their modus operandi being lightning fast assault aimed at catching the enemy by total surprise. They are also notable for employing hackers using sophisticated combat software. Following a number of spectacular successes, despite complete secrecy, the unit came to be a trump card in political struggle. For some they are a bargaining chip, for others, a valuable asset if expendable...

Disputes and lawsuits were followed by charges of attempted theft of fiscal reports and research results. Micromachines stock share price hit a slide after a leak of data stolen by a hacker, which in turn has sprouted conspiracy theories about competition involvement. Latest Nakamuras success streak in a few sizable bids for military equipment, traditional Micromachines domain, caused some nervous reactions from Micromachines management.

A few anonymous but reliable sources claim that the secret corporation struggle to win the best workers has escalated. Luring talents and project managers in with promises of higher wages is rife and mutual. Some even say about abductions and 'extractions' of key engineers from off-limits secret research labs.

According to our sources Nakamura Inc. is leading in the conflict. Micromachines is increasingly mentioning 'adequate' response. It is starting to look more and more like threatening.

Heavily armed and armored, backed by combat hackers, they are very effective in battling the cyborg crime menace. The team was formed with haste after a few spectacular failures by the police force that resulted in a high victim count. At first taking cue from military shock troops the officers were handed heavy weapons and armor. Gradually the modus operandi changed into something more sophisticated. The utilization of high mobility, combat hackers backup and specialized investigators has shorten reaction time extensively and increased operational flexibility. It was necessary to counter the exponential rise in cyborg related crime. Although covering wide range of tasks RAID 44 remains an elite formation. It is a result of a strict selection process and high equipment cost. Only the best, highly motivated and very intelligent can measure themselves with a foe that has a reaction time of machine and no compunction.

Dear pack of corporate hyenas.

Ive had it with you. After seven years of working for your greedy-ass corporation, Im through! Youve raked in millions off my code done for the peanuts you paid me. No extras ever, constant all-nighters, and interminable meetings that went nowhere. Add sexist jokes by both male and female directors for good measure. Ive hit my head on the glass ceiling one too many times! It was me who built up the backbone of the protection system, it was my work that served as the basis for every product for three whole years. It was me who sniffed out and prevented dozens of illegal entries to our network. And what do I have to show for it? Employee of the month prize. A weekend at a spa. Those morons at the Human Resources are out of their frigging minds. As is that dumbass, my boss.

Now Ill take what youve denied me all these years. Courses, upgrades, latest tech werent for me. I figure youve already found out about the budget database break-in and the large sum thats evaporated from the representation fund. Yes, that was me. I did design the system, after all. Im no thief, Im just claiming whats rightfully mine. Dont go out looking for me. The full cyberbody I ordered is waiting for me. Finally, an end to this organic crap I was trapped in. Theres no way you can find me. But if you were to try, let me just say that half a year back I set up microcams in recreational rooms for managers on floor 27. Fun stuff. A tasty scoop for a couple infochannels, for sure.

I hereby terminate my contract with immediate effect. Bite me!

Symbols  Graphics Copyright  2004-2015 Days of Wonder, Inc. Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.

This follows the principles of the basic Ticket to Ride game on a special board with special cards and rules. The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop.

There is an extra set of Tourist cards for the cities, each with a value to be earned by visiting that city. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules.

There are also spanners along some tracks which may help or hinder you. The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks - but there are some options in the spanner pack and the rules.

There are many new options in the rules: exchange all your cards at the start but keep all the new ones: discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn: earn extra points: and many more. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.

210663,Tribes,2017,0,0,0,2,4,20,30,,Ancient Civilization Exploration Prehistoric Territory Building ,Modular BoardTile Placement,"Guide your Tribe in its struggles to explore, expand, exploit and exterminate! For 2-4 players experiencing the Paleolithic, Neolithic and Bronze ages in 30 minutes.

Players start with a small tribe in an unexplored area and have very basic technologies. During the game they invent new technologies, tackle historical events and manage their resources. The first player to collect a set number of Victory points wins.

Tribes is a thematic prequel to Nations, designed by one of the Nations designers. 
It is a fast 4X game with a twist, each player has their own separate area to explore, expand and exploit. The other two areas of the game are highly interactive:


     the variable 3-tiered technology tree where first inventor gets a bonus
     the action column where you take an action every turn and unwanted actions accumulate gold in a closed and scarce system


The action column is also where historical events come into play, where the fourth technology in the game, Strength, is used to gain you bonuses and make bad things happen to your opponents.

Several interlocking systems ensure high replayability without adding overhead or upkeep. For example: one game gold can feel very scarce and the next abundant despite the exact same amounts being in play.

Tribes will be on Kickstarter by Tea Time Productions in January 2017, and if funded be printed in February 2017. PNP version is available on dev.teatimeproductions.se for playtesting and early access.

ABACA: Ten cards are dealt to each player.  The object of each hand is to try to be the first to use all ten cards to form words.  Play is simultaneous and each player uses their cards to form words.  After each player has made as many words as possible they discard one unused card and dealer then deals a new card to each player.  Cards are exchanged until someone declares ABACA meaning that all ten cards have been used in words.

Primary ABACA: Seven cards are dealt to each player and for each hand, every player places down a card - the winner of the hand is the person with the card closest to the letter A.  Player with the highest number of cards won is the winner.

ABACA Royal: Players add to previously played cards to create a new word.

ARGO ABACA: Players are dealt seven cards.  Players will add multiple cards to previously played cards to create words.

ABACA Rummy: Players are dealt seven cards. One card is placed face up.  First player takes either face up or top of deck and create as many words as he can in front of him and then discards one card.  Play continues and players can pick up any number of cards from discard stack as long as they play the bottom card each time.  Play continues until someone has used all their cards.

Combination ABACA: Can be played as game of solitaire or with several players.  Shuffle deck and place 25 cards face down in a 5 by 5 grid.  The remainder of the deck is placed on the center card.  Play begins by turning over any two cards.  If they form a word player places cards in their pile and is allowed another turn.  If they do not form a word, cards are turned back over and player takes a penalty card from center deck.

210908,It's a Train Wreck!,2016,7.5,2,1,1,6,5,10,,Action / Dexterity Party Game Puzzle Real-time Trains ,Co-operative PlayDice RollingModular BoardPick-up and DeliverPoint to Point Movement,"What do you call a 10 minute, real time, cooperative, dexterity, pick up and deliver, asymmetrical player setup, party game?
Answer: Its a Train Wreck!

Two to six players work together to deliver as many goods as possible before the end of 10 minutes. Each type of cargo is represented by dice of a particular color. Example: Yellow = Corn. During setup and before the clock is started the cargo dice are rolled and the number of pips indicates the destination city.  Once the clock is started all players take their actions simultaneously, in any order, and repeating any action as often as necessary. To transport the cargo, the dice must first be loaded onto a short or long train piece that is at rest in the players home city train yard. No train can move without a red caboose die, and no caboose can travel beyond the adjacent players city. In order to transport cargo to more distant cities a train will need to first stop and have the caboose dice swapped or cargo exchanged between trains. While all this is going on players must avoid dropping or spilling cargo or caboose dice when picking up or handing the train to another player. Tunnels and bridges between some cities present additional obstacles to negotiate. When time runs out calculate the score and compare the results to the achievement chart. Positive points are awarded for goods delivered to the correct city and trains that are able to stop in a train yard. Points are subtracted for dropped cargo, dropped cabooses, or cargo delivered to the wrong city. Players should try again to beat their best score and time. Optionally multiple teams can use additional copies of the game to compete head to head.

With six players each takes one of the six main cities, each producing a single type of goods which are delivered to the other five locations.
City #1 - Los Angeles  produces and ships Perishable Goods  Orange dice
City #2  Denver  produces and ships Minerals  Grey dice
City #3  St. Louis  produces and ships Corn  Yellow dice
City #4  Chicago  produces and ships Meat  Pink dice
City #5  Pittsburg  produces and ships Steel  Blue dice
City #6  New York  produces and ships Manufactured Goods  Purple dice
Note in some scenarios with fewer total players, each player may actually control multiple cities.

The components that make up one players city are as follows:
One City Name marker
One associated city number-tent (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5 or #6)
One Goods Production Source card. Example: Illustration of a corn field for the production of corn. 
Five Goods Received cards (to hold goods arrived from other cities).
One train yard (spaces for two trains, only one of which will fit the long train)
One short train (unloaded) (the TTR-1aB)
One large train (unloaded) (the BFT-9000)
Three customized Red dice (each represents a caboose, one for both starting trains and one spare). All three caboose dice start on the train yard in the designated caboose track. The number on the caboose matters and should match the home city. 
One set of cargo dice (all of a single color)


Cattle and Timber and Beer, Oh My! Expansions (sold separately) 
For additional challenge, smaller satellite cities can be added to the game. They come with a smaller train yard but no trains of their own. Any given satellite city may be controlled along with a players main city. Example: The player controlling New York can also control Boston, which produces Fish. Additional cargo dice types:

        Brown = Cattle
        Green = Timber/Wood Products
        Shimmering Black = Oil
        Silver and Blue Swirled = Fish
        Metal Flake Black = Automobiles
        Ivory = Wheat
        Translucent Amber = Beer
        White = Cotton
        Black = Coal

Beautiful, illustrated original art pieces that are visually stunning and reflect the Mexican Holiday - Dia Los Muertos. Non-linguistic, numeric  symbol based, with rules in English  Spanish!

Basic Game:
The game plays in one trick, with the led card determining whether high or low card leads to the next trick. High card takes all cards (which are marked for positive AND negative points). Cards are labeled with suit, rank (1-20), an High/Low indicator, and the points it is worth at the end of the game.

Advanced Game: The High/Low indicator on the card also determines whether the card is collected at the end of the trick by the highest or lowest card played in the trick. So there are two winners (or losers in the case of a pile of negative cards) in each trick.

The deck has 22 Ball cards, 21 Strikes, 10 Fouls, 21 Outs, 4 Double Plays, 1 Triple Play, 4 Pick-offs, 3 Safe on Error, 1 Safe on Bunt, 1 Hit by Pitch, 6 Singles, 3 Doubles, 2 Triples and 1 Home Run. Many of the Ball, Strike and Out cards have contingent results depending on location of any baserunners: safe or out on steals, sacrifices, tag-up on flies, fielders choice, and even a passed ball. And one Ball card has Game called on account of rain (only if players have agreed in advance to include this result).

This highly detailed deck creates a deep narrative for each game, even if the play itself is simple, involving luck rather than strategy. The deck is shuffled, and the batting player turns over cards one at a time until a third out. Highest score after nine innings of three outs each wins.

Each tile has a one of three different symbols (cross, circle or square) is each of the corners - exactly one card of all possible combinations up to rotation. To legally place a tile on the board it must be placed next at least one other tile and both the symbols along the common edge must match.

The main strategic aspect comes from the additional rule that if a player places a tile next to two or more tiles (such as in a corner) then they get to have another turn (with no limit on extra tuns achieved this way).

210968,Campaign: The Contest to Become President of the United States,1962,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,,Political ,,"This very rare 1962 title takes a multi-layered and highly strategic approach to the U.S. election campaign. It is designed for two players or teams. Components include a 4-part jigsaw-puzzle style board, a deck of weekly Event Cards, a deck of Daily Crisis cards, sets of red and blue counters, a campaign tally sheet, one red and one blue campaign die, a rules book and a summary playing sequence card.

Each state is classified by region, political philosophy (Liberal/Conservative), party preference (Democrat/Republican) and key economic interest (Mining, Manufacturing or Farming). Each party begins by choosing Presidential and VP home states (with local and regional benefits) and political philosophy (Conservative, Liberal or Moderate).

Each campaign week starts with an Event card that combines a random bonus/penalty event with a political statement or proposal. Candidates get penalties and bonuses depending on the stand they support. For instance, supporting a Southern Senator's controversial statement adds 3 regional points in the South but costs 1 in other regions and 2 in each Liberal state; denouncing has an opposite effect.

Each week has six campaign days. On each day, the candidate can make a personal appearance in any one state, adding 5 points in that state, sometimes modified by that day's Crisis card. Each party also has a limited number of media campaigns that can be targeted locally (+8), regionally (+3) or nationally (+1). Point counters are used to show net advantage in each state and in boxes for regions, economic interests, political philosophy and the nation as a whole, while the party advantages in each state are marked on the board.

The game runs for 9 weeks plus the Monday before Election Day. On election day, the result for each state is determined by tallying each party's net advantage in national, regional and local support, economic interest, political philosophy and party advantage, modified by a final -2 to +2 die roll by each party. The party with the highest net wins that state's electoral college votes, and 270 EC votes wins the election. An EC vote tie is broken by number of states won, with the District of Columbia being the final tie-breaker.

Players of the game select lineups of cards, each card representing an actual major league baseball player. The sequence of play consists of a series of plate appearances as if playing a game of baseball. Each plate appearance is resolved by: (1) rolling two dice, (2) reading a number code from the batter's card based on the roll, and (3) looking up the number code on a chart corresponding to the current distribution of runners on base to determine the result of the plate appearance.

The designer, Clifford Van Beek, was granted a U.S. patent for the game system in 1925 (#1536639), though the game was not published until 1930. The game was apparently only published once, with 18 cards for each of the 16 teams then competing in the major leagues.

A recreated version of the game was published in 2003 by a company called Sports Game Publishing.

211087,Carteso,2016,9,1,0,2,2,20,120,,Abstract Strategy ,Area Control / Area InfluencePaper-and-PencilPattern BuildingPattern RecognitionTile Placement,"				
					Introduction

Carteso is a territory game for two players: Vertical and Horizontal. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The suggested board sizes are between 9x9 and 13x13 points. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of stones in two colors.

Carteso was designed by Luis Bolaos Mures and Corey L. Clark. The game's name was suggested by David Stoner.

				
					Definitions

A group is a set of like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones.

A group's value is the size of the smallest rectangle in which it fits, i.e. the product of the number of rows and the number of columns that it spans.

A group, regardless of color, is owned by Vertical if it spans more rows than columns, and by Horizontal if it spans more columns than rows. If a group spans exactly as many rows as columns, it's owned by neither player.

				
					Play

Vertical plays first, then turns alternate.

On their turn, a player must either pass or place one stone of any color on an empty point. Both players can use both stone colors. Vertical can't pass on their first turn.

The game ends when both players pass consecutively. A player's score is the sum of the values of the groups that they own in the final position, plus a komi (see below) in the case of Horizontal. The player with the highest score wins.

				
					Komi

The komi is the number of points which is added to Horizontal's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. To avoid ties, it is suggested that komi be of the form n + 0.5, where n is a whole number.

Build your cities and spread their fame together with your family and fiends. Construct new buildings, magnificent monuments of become a leader and push the mankind's progress forward. Exceed your opponents with wealth and glory of your city, as well as the pride of your population.

In Urbnie your score is the lowest of the scored wealth, prestige and satisfaction. Each monument adds a point as well as 2 points for person who ends the game.

Each turn in Urbnie gives you the choice of 3 possible actions:
- Take a building card from 1 of the 4 stacks and add it to your city. You can either build over a existing building or expand your city. In that case you have to pay with wealth.
- You can take the city growth card for 1 point of either wealth, prestige or satisfaction. The next turn you have to take a building card and can expand for free. You then return the city growth card.
- Claim a monument. For this you have to have the right symbols on your buildings.
Once 3 of the 4 stacks of buildings for the current epoch are empty the current player can end the round. Then all buildings are scored for the current epoch. The player ending the round can start the next round. Urbnie is played over 6 epochs.

The buildings have different point values for the different epochs. Where your standard housing from the start gives you 2 points of satisfaction in the first epoch, it's only 1 point in the second epoch. And going negative from epoch 4 onward. Also several buildings interact with each other, giving extra points if the other building is present in your city.

Contains two Ruins tokens and the corresponding Ruinscards.

From the included rules sheet:

Set up of the Ruins token
At the end of the first offering phase and before actions are permed, the player who has chosen Apollo picks two different islands (or territories if playing with the Titans expansion) which are not controlled by any player and places a Ruins token on each.
Note: If more than one player have chosen Apollo, whoever receives the prosperity marker gets to choose where to place the Ruin.

Controlling the Ruins
When a player takes control of an island containing a Ruins token, he randomly draws a Monument card amongst the unused Monuments set aside at the beginning of the game.

He places the card face up in front of him and places the card matching the Ruins token on top.

This player alone is allowed to build that Monument following the usual rules but can only place it on the island with the Ruins token.

When another player conquers the island, he seizes the card at the same time. Now he only can build the Monument on this island. As soon as the monument is built, the Ruins token and the corresponding card are both removed from play.

211122,Emily Is Probably Dead By Now,2017,0,0,0,4,6,20,30,,Bluffing Card Game Deduction Murder/Mystery ,Hand Management,"Emily Is Probably Dead By Now
A sinister game of bluffing and collusion for 4-6 players.

Gameplay begins with all players guilty of murdering Emily and hiding the body.
Everyone at the table is guilty and is looking for a way out.
Each player begins with pieces of evidence that they must stash in order to get away with murder and win the game leaving the other players to waste away behind bars.

During each round of the game players will play location cards face down claiming that they are helping the town search party look for the missing Emily. The rest of the group needs to decide if you are actually checking a location or trying to stash evidence when nobody is looking.

If you get caught hiding evidence you will gain suspicion which will make it more difficult to get rid of your current evidence and if you are caught trying to collude with other players you will gain additional pieces of evidence.

Ok.....so get rid of evidence that's it right? It can't get much worse then committing a murder and having evidence on you as you help search for the missing person. Well that is true until one unlucky player ends up actually picking up Emily and must now get rid of this very damming piece of evidence .
If any player is caught with Emily's body the game immediately ends and that player will receive the death penalty while all other players will serve jail sentences based on how much evidence they currently have in their hand.

Game Highlights

Bluffing
Bluffing and hiding your true intentions is the heart and sole of this game. The mechanics were developed to not get in the way or hinder your ability to bluff your way through a tough situation. There are situations in the game that will test your metal and challenge your ability to maintain a convincing deception.

Collusion
Players will have opportunities on the fly to quickly decide to work with each other to get further in the game but beware there can only be one winner and colluding with others carries a much higher penalty and invites a firm back-stab from savvy players looking to catch you off guard.

Quick Game Play
Emily Is Probably Dead is very quick to learn and each game takes about 20-30 mins to conclude. Making this a perfect filler game to play in between other games or as a quick fun gaming experience with very little time commitment.

A New Twist On the Who Dunnit Theme
So who dunnit?......You all did! now its a question of who is going to get caught and who is going to get away with murder!

Your heart rate slows and your breathing steadies, as you realize you are in a hospital. You glance around you, finding your room empty. You read your identifying armband to see a name you dont recognize. As your bare feet smack to the cold tile floor and you steady your wobbling body, you feel the foreign presence of absence. You are alone          
 Stepping into the hall, you find a few others dressed in the pale mint green of hospital gowns. They look as confused as you feel. Your bare footfalls echo through the otherwise silent hall. Mumbling half-greetings and bemused questions at one another, you notice a sign above a vacant nurses' station: Long Term Care Unit.
 What does that mean, one of the others asks, noticing you staring at the sign.
            
The vegetable patch The coma ward. another mutters gruffly, clearing sleep from their throat.
 How long have we been out? a nervous voice chimes. Im more concerned with what happened to everyone else 
 Who else? Theres only us.
 Exactly
 In Coma Ward, players are patients who have awoken in an abandoned yet still functioning hospital.  With no memory and no idea of what is happening. Patients must search the hospital for clues and necessities. In their search, patients may find unspeakably terrifying things

Each time you play, youll explore an ever-changing hospital as you search for the clues to your identity and the cause of the environment's unsettling emptiness. Balance your ever worsening Terror and Neurosis while monitoring your health and physical attributes. Remember to stay close to those who you awoke with because the shadows of the empty hospital can destroy your already fragile psyche

Once all the clues have been discovered, the true horror begins. Players will discover what is actually happening and face the phenomenon players find out who they can trustif anyone, and how to win.

Coma Ward plays 2-6 players in 45-120 minutes. Each game is a unique phenomenon that will introduce diverse and dynamic rules. Coma Ward is a mature game with themes of violence, absolution, distrust, gore, and traumatic incidence. Player discretion is advised.

Coma Ward plays in two parts: 
  The Prologue:

Patients will move through the Hospital discovering new Tiles that represent rooms. Some Tiles will affect a Patients Health or Terror. Other Tiles will impact the game in other unpredictable ways.

While they explore and search, Patients will discover items that will help them in their frantic search for answers. Items like Clothing and makeshift Weapons will defend you from unseen forces or even other hostile Patients. While Medicine and Food can restore your Health and Focus. Ultimately, Patients are searching for the horrific Clues to what has happened in this hospital. Once all of the Clues have been revealed, the true game objective unfolds


The Phenomenon:

Upon uncovering the final Clue, the Phenomenon is triggered. Players will then withdraw and open the specified sealed envelope from the box revealing its secret contents telling the story of what is happening and how to win the game.

Some Phenomenon are cooperative, with players racing to escape the hospital or defeat cruel forces. While other Phenomenon will pit players against each other in secret alliances or an all out fight for survival. 
Each Phenomenon can lead to multiple endings. So, even if Players reveal the same Phenomenon multiple times, they will always have a unique experience.
Some Phenomenon are physical, real, threats inspired by classic horror tropes;  others explore metaphysical and psychological themes

Are you ready to open your eyes and experience the phenomenal horror of Coma Ward?

211146,Four Suspects,2016,6.5,2,0,2,5,30,45,,Deduction Murder/Mystery ,,"One murder. Four Suspects. And everyone claims to have an alibi.

Four Suspects offers 30 minutes of deep deduction. Each of four suspects claim to have been at a certain location at a certain time, and each alibi is represented by a card. At the beginning of the game these 16 cards are shuffled and one is put away. This is the missing alibi that needs to be identified, and the remaining cards are divided between the players.

Players takes turn choosing one of three available interrogation cards from the middle of the table. The chosen card lets you ask one other player for information about their cards. Questions are in the form of How many cards do you have showing either the park or the shopping mall?, How many cards do you have showing the young woman?, and so on.

In a 2-player game each has two hotel rooms with 3 or 4 guests. All questions only concern the occupants of one room.

Each time a player is asked a question they receive 1 coin. Coins can be used to hire the help of assistants, which provides special abilities, like the ability to lie, to avoid showing cards, take another turn and so on.

This coin mechanism balances a problem of many deduction games, that the player being asked more questions are generally at a disadvantage. The assistants also make sure the players have to combine different kinds of information while trying to deduce the missing alibi, making 4 suspects a challenging game for deduction game lovers.

The game components are language independent.

Be the first player to score five victory points. Players earn victory points by having their robot on an active target space at the end of a round or by destroying opposing robots with your weapons or a push into a pit.

Each round you program your robot with 3 out of 4 dice, moving him in the arena or using weapons or other modules. Pips and color of the dice decide the activation order.

Arenas: 3 new arenas with 1 special feature each: surrounding pit, target areas, lightning spaces and barriers.

Programming: Programming by 3 out of 4 dice on 3 control units instead of 3 dice on 2 units.

Module types: Modules are divided into 3 types marked by colors for damage, movement and specials only 2 different can be installed permanently at first.

Module activation: Most modules are now restricted to 1 color of a dice and to some number of pips.

Tactical modules: Many modules provide now break points while activated to change there behavior within battle.

Permanent vs. 1-time modules: After dying or at work shops you receive new modules. You decide if you like them to be permanent or just for 1 time use. Youll be able to activate up to 4 modules by just 1 dice in the later game.

B.e.a.s.t.s: Robots controlled by a cute, addictive AI can be thrown into the arena to spice up the battle when only 2 or 3 normal robots are in. There are different programs and upgrades for melee and ranged beasts.

Teamplay: You can play 2 vs. 2 in a special domination arena with 2 to 4 players by adding some beasts as partners.
