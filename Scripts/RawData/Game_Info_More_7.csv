It is appreciated that modern naval vessels are equipped with highly sophisticated electronics and weapons systems, but their prime object is still to destroy enemy shipping or incoming missiles. It is therefore assumed that Ships Captains and Gunnery Officers will be aware of the best means to fight off incoming attacks and will use all available missiles and gunnery to its best advantage, as they close to tactical battle range.

A percentage system has been adopted and therefore a lair of percentage dice will be needed to play the game. The dice -one red (10s) and one white or black (units) are always thrown in pairs (e.g. an 8 on the red dice and a 2 on the white or black dice represents a throw of 82%). All figures in the tables are basic percentage chance of hits or detection, after this has been amended by the tactical factors which may apply, the final score is arrived at. A throw of this percentage or less is sufficient. A short measuring tape is provided for use when moving ships but an expanding metal tape will be of use for measuring the ranges of long range weapons.

9401,Armour and Infantry,1973,6.29167,12,2.75,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Miniatures Wargame World War II ,Dice RollingPaper-and-Pencil,"Miniature rules
Although our title gives precedence to armored warfare, this set of rules is equally suitable for combat between infantry companies, and is the first to make realistic provision for all the fringe areas such as communication, engineering, air attack, obstacle clearance, fighting in fortifications, off-table fire, air observation, target location, weather, all types of terrain, and the reaction of troops to combat stress.

The rules are designed to be equally suitable for the old favorite 1/72 scale models and figures and the newer scales down to 1/300 which are revolutionizing modern period war gaming.

The period covered by this set has been selected to include the rise of the fast tank and the independent armored formation, the Spanish, Abyssinian, Sino-Japanese, Russo-Japanese and Russo-Finnish Wars, all the campaigns of the second world war from the invasion of Poland to the Russian sweep through Japanese Manchuria, and the Korean War.
A companion set covers the period from 1950 to 1975, which sees the introduction of anti-tank guided missiles, helicopters, range finders, and efficient A.P.D.S., H.E.S.H. and H.E.A.T. ammunition for tank guns.
A third set covers the whole period from 1925 to 1975, but from the point of view of infantry platoon level combat, and is suitable for figures from 1/72 to 1/35 scale.

This particular period is a very complicated one, with old weapons being replaced by new in an ever proliferating series.
As usual, we include quick reference sheets to avoid leafing through the complete text in a frantic attempt to find the bit you want.
As it is impossible to include details of all weapons on a single sheet, it has instead those that are reasonably universal, together with blank spaces into which you can copy from the main text those others you want to use.
After all, not many wargamers habitually use both Centurions and 1920 vintage Vickers Mediums at the same time, but please dont take this as a challenge!

We presume throughout that a player will have a general knowledge of the weapons he elects to use, and so include performance details only.

One change from our previous sets of rules is the use of alternate instead of simultaneous movement. This is partly due to the reduced validity of a strict time scale in tank versus tank engagements where an exchange of fire is normally completed and one tank disabled in 10 to 15 seconds at close range. It also speeds up play, giving a truer flavor of fast moving tank action, and enables you to tell at a glance which party in an exchange shoots first.

Other innovations include a one to one figure scale and an arithmetical instead of a logarithmic ground scale. A model or figure therefore always represents a single tank or man, not a platoon or section, and a millimeter measured on the table always represents one meter.
Metric measures are used because all campaigns were fought with metric maps, even the one inch ordnance survey has a 1,000 metro grid.

Finally, this is the first set of rules we have produced where we can claim relevant personal experience, one of us having served in the Desert and in Western Europe during the Second World War, and the other having been in turn a field engineer, a tank gunner with experience of Churchill and Sherman and later tanks, and an infantryman.

Includes the rule book and a Quick Reference Sheet

Production qualities are fairly low but the 17 by 12 map is workmanlike in 5 colors and the counters are clear with Swedes in light blue and Russians in green.
The Russians are on the defensive in prepared positions but are surprised by a sudden Swedish attack through the marshes on the flank of the position. The Swedish units are much better than their opponents but there are few of them. The fight is therefore fairly evenly matched.
The Rules use a standard sequence of play of Move, Defender fires, Attacker fires, Melee and then Rally. Losses are taken to attack strength necessitating the use of loss markers but stacking is limited so the stacks do not get too high.
Special rules include Leaders, Pontoon Bridges, Surprise, extra reinforcements etc.

9407,Defiance: The Battle of Xuan Loc,1980,6.03571,14,3,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Vietnam War Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Defiance - The Battle of Xuan Loc (11 April 1975) - Combat Series No. 2 - A Vietnam War Game (designer Perry Moore) by Swedish Game Production.

Defiance - The Battle of Xuan Loc includes a three-color map, 130 die cut counters, typeset rules and charts, and ziplock bags for counter storage. The game achieves accurate simulation by means of special rules like: Close Assault, Cluster Bombs, Off-Board Artillery, ARVN desertion, CRT shifts for Leader and Armor units, Optional 'what if' Order of Battle, Air Support, Artillery Barrages. Also included are a Historical Background and Designer's Notes for full playing enjoyment of this unusual battle of the Vietnam War.

During the closing days of the 1975 North Vietnamese Offensive, four NVA divisions were pitted against a small ARVN force, dug-in astride the rugged hills near Xuan Loc - a town of 30,000 people located along one of the key roads into the capital, Saigon. Advancing in strength down the coastal highway were the NVA 5th, 6th, 7th and 341st Divisions, massed with artillery and T-54 tanks. Defiantly blocking their way were the ARVN 18th Divisions and 3rd Tank Brigade. The battle which followed was unique in many respects for the Vietnam War, involving units of divisional size, devastatingly effective ARVN airpower and sophisticated US-made CBU-55 Cluster Bombs. For nearly 2 weeks, the ARVN held Xuan Loc and counterattacked against impossible odds. It was an engagement describable only as 'heroic and gallant' on the part of the South Vietnamese defenders, being one of the few places where the ARVN, though outnumbered, stood and fought with a tenacity which stunned their opponents. So epic was the stand of the ARVN that the entire South Vietnamese Army, previously routed, grew confident again. News reporters were flown in from around the world to witness the battlefield strewn with NVA corpeses, repelled in assault after assault with heavy losses. Game Rating (Based on independent test group results): Complexity - Moderate, Balance - 50% - 50%, Realism - 7, Excitement - 9, Overall - 6.5, Play Time - 3-4 hours.

The end of the Vietnam War - April 1975. The US have pulled out and the South's armies are crumbling before the North's advance.
The components are functional with a 17 by 12 map and about 100 counters. The map is in 4 colours and shows the area around Xuan Loc including Bien Hoa Airbase. The counters are light green for ARVN and dark green for NVA. each counter is a Regiment or Brigade.
The rules are detailed and cover most aspects of modern war without getting too complicated. Special rules include Leaders, Headquarters, Fortifications, ARVN Desertions, Cluster Bombs etc. 
From the Designer's Notes: the game is truly a slugfest. Both sides have a road to victory.

9414,Rules for modern naval warfare 1950-1985,1985,7.33333,3,0,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Nautical Wargame ,Dice RollingPaper-and-Pencil,"These rules have been designed to simulate a modern naval action involving surface ships, submarines and aircraft of todays (1980s) navies, using the recently introduced range of 1:3000 scale warships.

The rules were originally designed for a large scale naval campaign in which large numbers of ship8 would be engaged in combat. To achieve this it was necessary to generalize certain areas for the sake of playability this, whilst not giving absolute realism (which can never be achieved in a game), resulted in a very fast and enjoyable game. The rules are not designed for a single ship v. single ship combat, as it was considered highly unlikely that in any future Warpac/NATO conflict a solitary NATO ship would come across and fight a solitary WarPac warship. The more likely course of events 1s for the WarPac (Soviet) navies to sail (by devious routes) to prearranged rendezvous points several days before hostilities are due to commence. From there the Task Forces prime function would be to disrupt the American reinforcement of Europe; to intercept and destroy the Vital oil cargoes in the Arabian Gulf, off the African coast and in the Indian Ocean; to prevent the transfer of allied warships into and out of the Mediterranean, and to harass the US Pacific Fleet (with the idea of drawing forces from the Atlantic to keep the Pacific Fleet in being to counter any threat in the Pacific) A further option open to the Soviets would be to use the obsolete Kynda class cruisers to bombard US coastal cities with their long range missiles, compelling the US to keep back warships to protect their own coasts.

In any of the above scenarios the Soviets would use their ships en masse to achieve their objectives. It was with those actions in mind that these rules were written, to enable the Wargamer to fight through the Atlantic convoys, to endeavor to keep the oil flowing or to fight for the glory of the revolution and crush the wicked capitalists (even if it costs you your life comrade). It is hoped that the users of these rules do know something of modern warships and win use this set as the basis of a campaign involving a number of wargamers as it is only when there are large numbers of ships involved that the maximum enjoyment can be obtained.

GERMANS:There are Objectives set up for the NON-Player side centered around the 3 PANZER Divisions involved and when some are accomplished or moved to, then NEW ones are determined that they'll have to achieve and this process continues throughout the game. The entrapped 6th ARMY has it's OWN Breakout Decision Table as well. 
SOVIETS:The various Soviet CORPS/Armies have differing Objectives according to their COMPOSITION and the GERMAN's Units near them which produces a Modifier which is then applied to the SOVIET die-roll on the Objective Table. This can result in the subject CORPS/ARMY adopting an Elastic-Defense, Fighting-Defense, Hold-at-ALL-Costs, Advance-to-Contact, Limited-Assault, or All-out-Assault which are further explained in the RULES Booklet in greater detail.

THIS is one of the more professionally produced Games by Perry Moore, et al, and takes an unusual tact in that the Units have Movement Designations using LETTERs instead of NUMBERs for them. These are H-horse drawn~[6]-Movement Points, L-Leg powered(Infantry)~[4]-M.P.s, T-Track equipped~[9]-M.P.s,  W-Wheel based~[10]-M.P.s. Units will also have a Troop QUALITY letter with E=Elite, D=Depleted and NO letter=LINE. This can affect COMBAT  RETREATS, which result in Disruption for Depleted Units although Elite  Line Units are not so affected. The SOLITAIRE Rules have been extensively detailed to allow Players to experience the game system and formulate some strategem which they can apply in some future game against a worthy opponent.

You will be faced with a wide range of investment options - some safe but sure, others risky but potentially very rewarding. Whatever investments you choose will be affected, favorably or unfavorably, by the economic climate - which rarely remains stable for very long. The object of the game is to provide your character with as much financial security as possible. To be successful, you'll need a combination of skill and luck, as you try to anticipate changing economic times while also taking into account your character's special strengths and weaknesses.

The game does not involve building houses, but investing in a commodity futures exchange. This is the key difference from Monopoly. In the exchange, one invests money for a commodity. Dice is used to determine if profits are made or lost. Other aspects (rent, movement, bonuses for all in a color group) are similar to Monopoly.

On each turn a player will ask several questions about the colour of Benno's clothing items on the cards that the other players have; questions specify a clothing item and a colour.  If the answer to a question is `no', then the player asks the same question to other players.  If all of them say no then the colour that Benno is wearing for that item has been determined and the player gets a victory point chip.  If someone answers `yes' then a new question must be asked of the same person.  The round ends when all of the colours have been determined.

9444,Land Lords,2004,5.66667,6,0,3,5,45,45,,Card Game Medieval Memory ,Hand ManagementMemory,"From the publisher:

A card game in which players will find themselves fighting against each other, as powerful landlords of the middle ages, to expand their dominions. Your army may not be the only way to lead you to the victory, your skillful merchants and the loyalty of your townsfolk may be the key to achieve power. A difficult game for hard-core gamers.

From the designer:

It's a card game. It's more difficult (not for beginners!). The cards are Tarot-size. Each player is a Noble trying to take control of new territories. The Land cards have to be explored and each player must send Farmers, Merchants, Soldiers, Hunters and Artisans to have influence on the territory. Then, at the proper time, each Noble can try to take control of one of the territories provoking an Event (a War, a Market or so on). If he wins the Event he takes control of the territory and he scores points. When all territories have been controlled the game is over. It's more difficult. It requires good memory, good strategy and almost no luck.

From the back of the box (translated):

In this game, the players are piloting a space ship with a set amount of fuel. Pirates will force them into unforeseen maneuvers, so they have to keep track of their fuel supplies.
In many different scenarios up to four players may engage at the same time, while the rules are different each time. The basic rules, though, stay the same in every game, e.g. for flight maneuvers or movement. 
In the starting scenarios, they have to deal with navigation and movement, whereas the advanced setting allows for more variation, like different planets, refueling, evasion, freight, etc. The different game phases are navagation, movement, and supply.
Then there are expert scenarios, which add mines and rockets to the battles. Here we have these game phases: navigation, ranged weapons, movement, fights, and supply.

The format is very straight forward - the active player or team is told which show the question is about.  A level of difficulty is then selected by the answering team.  The harder the question, the more spaces that will be advanced on a correct answer or backwards on an incorrect answer.  First player to the finish line (twenty spaces away) is the winner.

9483,Syon,1987,3.5,2,0,2,6,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Pattern Building,"The object of this abstract strategy game is to bring together 4 sun pieces (2 each of 2 different colors) into a connected chain.  Each player has a hidden goal card with his 2 colors.  This means that many times two players have a color in common, making it a challenge to help yourself without helping your opponent even more.

The game is played on a 6x6 grid of points.  24 planets are placed at random on these points at the beginning of the game.  8 sun pieces are placed in the square spaces formed by the grid points.

On your turn, you can move any one planet to any empty point on the grid, or, if a sun is surrounded by 4 planets, you can move that sun to an adjacent space.  The only restrictions are that you cannot undo the last player's move or move a planet away from a completely surrounded sun.

You win immediately if your 4 suns are connected in a chain of any shape.

August 21, 1942...Colonel Ichiki's men were practically wiped out the night before in wave after wave of banzai attacks across the Tenaru into the well-prepared Marine defenses. Canister, machine-gun fire, and courage had broken Ichiki's back. As dawn rose above the sand bar it was time for the Marines to mop up...

September 13, 1942...The Japanese under Colonel Kawaguchi were pressing hard to take the Lunga Ridge from Edson's Raiders. The Marines bent, but had not yet broken, and were making a last stand on the final defensive obstacle between the Japanese and Henderson Field. Outnumbered, the Raiders had but one advantage - artillery. As shell after shell slammed into the Japanese staging areas, they elect to attack and fight rather than die staging for an assault. With a fateful BANZAI! they charge up the hill one more time...

September 27, 1942...The Marines, anxious to take the fight to the Japanese, mount an ambitious plan to surround and destroy the majority of the Japanese forces at the moutn of the Matanikau River. A three-pronged attack, each prong depending on the others succeeding, was devised. When the first attack to take the river crossing points failed, messages to cancel the remainder of the offensive were never received and the remaining elements of the offensive soon went from the hunters to the hunted. Could Marine Corps legend Chesty Puller extract his men from this sticky situation...

December 25, 1942...Army troops, having taken over for most of the Marine formations, were eager to prove their mettle on the assault. Their first task on the long list of objectives required to clear the island was a strongpoint called the Gifu. This particularly nasty position of pillboxes and machine-guns would prove to be a tough nut to crack, however...

History. That's why many gamers enjoy ASL-its ability to simulate a historical battle. Yet how can you study and entire campaign while still enjoying your favorite tactical game? This package addresses that need. A Historical Study will touch upon all aspects of a campaign either by incorporating part of it into a campaign game or by presenting a representative scenario to help enlighten the player as to why particular choices may have been made. All while enjoying the world's best squad-level tactical game.

Operation: Watchtower is the first of the Historical Studies, which is appropriate since Guadalcanal was the first American offensive in the Pacific. Hopefully, once a player has played through the sixteen scenarios within, they'll better understand the campaign and its outcome.

At the beginning of the game, each player places his pieces as he wishes. The value of each piece is hidden from the opponent. The 'Z' piece is placed on the fixed base point, and therefore known to the opponent. The goal is to capture the opponents 'Z' piece.

Each turn a player can move one of his pieces one place, either straight or diagonal. Or a player can use his turn to uncover the value of one of his pieces. He then turns the piece upside down and can play with it according to its true value.

There are null-pieces, an arrow-piece, cross pieces and plus pieces. All have different movement behavior but until they are revealed they all move like the null-piece.

The surprise of the game is that it can move slow and carefully or it has fast and open attacks.

9521,Namesake,1998,5.975,20,1,2,6,60,60,,Dice Party Game ,Roll / Spin and Move,"For 2 to 6 players or teams.

The objective is to move around the board (via dice roll), respond (as an individual or team) to category challenges when given a FIRST name, and be the first to the end.  Feels much like Pictionary and such, except if stumped by a category, you can always choose to roll and move BACKWARDS instead.

There are 6 major categories: Stars  Co., Musicians, History/News Makers, Fictional Characters, Athletes  Co., and Authors/Artists.  Draw a first name card, and name someone famous in that category, with that first name, within 30 seconds!

As well, there are 'nameoff' and 'namedrop' squares.  Nameoff is a back-and-forth all-play, until 30 seconds pass where neither team can name any more people; last accepted answer wins the challenge.
Namedrop is solo challenge to name (dice roll) number of famous people with that first name within the time limit.

Whenever there is any question of validity (famous? first name matches? category fits? nickname or short form valid?), your OPPONENT(s) are the judge!

For each hole, the objective is to use your dealt card choices to secretly bid for your shot length. Longest shot is #1, shortest is #4, etc. Pre-designated spots for each shot are on the hole cards, with par minus 2 sets of spots per hole. Bid to avoid the trouble locations - behind trees, or in the sand or water or out-of-bounds - or being too far from the pin. Pre-planning is important on the longer holes, as some types of trouble are worse than others (penalty strokes), and because there will be multiple secret bids on the par 4's and 5's.

When you do get in trouble, roll the die and consult the hazard chart. Keep track of all shots/rolls/penalties - maximum is 3-over par per hole.

After everyone has gotten to the green, then they get to use the plastic putting green. By placing a marble somewhere behind the line designating their 'distance' to putt, they try to get the marble to roll into the hole!

The Newest and Greatest Creation in Board Games

40 new and different games of skill for children and adults.

Created by John Scarne, World's Foremost Game Authority.

From the rule book:

A NEW ERA IN BOARD GAMES

40 New and Different Skill Games

After a lifetime of experiment, John Scarne, the world's foremost game authority, proudly presents SCARNEY, the game board that was purposely designed not alone as a pastime for adults but as an educational aid and recreational activity for children.

The SCARNEY Game Board is without a doubt the greatest creation in amusement games since the invention of playing cards back in the eleventh century.

There are more than 40 new and sensational skill games that may be played on the SCARNEY Game Board -- each a different game in itself and each possessing its own ingenious point scoring system for a single game or match.

Exciting, easy to learn games for one to six players, individually or in partnership style. Includes SCARNEY, a skill game based on an entirely new game principle known as The Kaleidoscopic Principle; HIGH-LOW SCARNEY, the world's quickest ending skill game; SCARNEY CHECKERS, a checker style game wiht a Gin Rummy scoring; SCARNEY CHALLENGE, an unequaled point scoring track game; SOLITAIRE SCARNEY and MOKO SOLITAIRE, the two greatest all-skill solitaire board games ever invented. The perfect diversion for home and club.

* * *

The board consists of a 4 x 4 grid. The pieces are numbered 1-4 in four different colors (making 16 in all). In the basic game, each player removes a 1 piece, and then takes turns jumping and removing pieces (like in checkers, but orthogonally, not diagonally). Each piece that is jumped must be of a different color than the one which is moved.

The game ends when one player cannot make another move. If the remaining pieces are of different colors, the player who CANNOT move takes the remaining pieces and adds their total to his score. However, if the pieces are all of the SAME color, the PREVIOUS player (the one who made the last move) gets the points, plus a 10-point-per-piece bonus. If the remaining colors are all black, the bonus is increased to 20 points per piece.

Needless to say, there are numerous variations to these rules among the 39 other games that can be played with this set.

Players take turns as the contestant and the remaining players are the panel. The contestant picks a card containing a sentence that the panel has to try and guess. With the timer running, a panelist may ask 'yes' or 'no' questions to find the answer. If a yes answer is returned, the panelist continues while, if the answer is no, play passes to the next player. If one of the panelists mentions a word on the card, this word is written on the board. If the panelists determine what is on the card, they win. If not, play proceeds for three rounds of the timer.

At the end of each round if the answer is not guessed, the contestant wins a prize, like a picture of a guitar on a card or a picture of a boom box. After the third round, a game of charades ensues to try and determine the answer.

A 'Secret Slime is also present where if a panelist performs a certain action (like laugh or touch his/her face), he/she must complete a penalty task.

The game also includes an entry form to be on the show, but not a time travel machine to allow this.

As He-man crosses the treacherous terrain, Skeletor and Beastman, the Volcano Keepers seek to delay his journey to the mighty castle.

Using a spinner to determine how many squares they advance, the players travel freely across the 3D boardgame representing the lands of Eternia, until they reach one of the two crater-packed volcanos controlled by Skeletor and his aide. This two pieces are rotated  each time a 6 is obtained on the spinner or a player falls in a square that orders it. Each time the volcanos are rotated, the crater squares changes its position. If a player falls on one of them, they must move back as much squares as it reads in the crater. Therefore, the player rotating the volcano can do it strategically in order to gain advantage over his competitors, making them fall in the craters. Once the volcanos are left behind, the first to reach the drawbridge of Grayskull wins the game.

Movement on the spinner ranges from 1-5, while the 6 space causes the Command Center to move instead of the player's character.   This can be used to move it closer to their location and/or further from opponents.

The goal is to be the first to reach the Command Center.

9564,William the Conqueror: 1066,1976,6.77885,26,3.3333,2,3,120,120,Wargames,Medieval Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterSimultaneous Action Selection,"William the Conqueror - 1066 is a two or three player tactical wargame which recreates the Battles of Stamford Bridge and Senlac Hill (more commonly known as the Battle of Hastings), the most decisive battles ever fought on English soil. The results of these battles profoundly changed the course of English history and language. At Stamford Bridge, the Viking invasion of England was repulsed by the Anglo-Saxon army, while three weeks later, at Senlac Hill, the Norman invaders successfully defeated the Anglo-Saxon army and were able to conquer the whole of England. The outcome of the Battle of Senlac Hill was a direct result of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In a campaign game, players play the Battle of Stamford Bridge first. Then the Battle of Senlac Hill is played with an order of battle determined by the outcome of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Either game may be played independently of the other.

1066 uses a revolutionary innovation in wargaming entitled the MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM. There is no die to throw nor any card to choose. The result of an attack depends entirely upon how intelligently you move, not the luck of the die. The MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM consists of the attacker moving adjacent to an enemy unit, then both players moving one hex simultaneously. The result of this move determines the result of the attack.

The dice are placed on the board such that the centers face off against each other, while the forwards go against the guards.  The game starts with a roll-off between the centers.  The winner gains the ball (represented by the offensive marker), which grants a bonus to the attacker's dice rolls.  Only forwards and centers can take shots to score points; the guards steal the ball.  All positions can pass among each other.

The first player to reach an agreed-on score wins and ends the game.

The game board is a square frame holding nicely-made square pieces. To begin, the frame is populated with one level of pieces on all spaces, except for the center on which five pieces are stacked and stabilized with a rod through the middle. Each player gets a large ball that fits on the hole in the pieces, and the starting position is determined based on the number of players (2-4).

With the goal being to get your ball onto the center tower, you progress by moving your ball anywhere on the same level you start and then placing another piece on an adjacent space (adding a level to that space.) You can move down the structure for free as long as you don't skip a level, but once you move onto a higher level in your turn it is over. Using this mechanism, players try to craft a path to the top of the tower that can't be used by others or use their ball as a blocking point to keep someone off the level you need.

Each player is a world leader with three scandals to protect.  The object of the game is to expose all the other players' scandals before they expose yours.

No dice are involved.  A player may choose to move between one and six spaces clockwise around the board.  The player then follows any special instructions written on the space that he or she lands on (these include collecting a Dirty Tricks Card, collecting a cash handout from the Hush Fund, calling a Press Conference, using the Shredder, hiding in a Safe House, or Passing The Buck).  A non-player character, the Journalist, is moved the same number of spaces clockwise around the board.  If the journalist lands on a space occupied by another player, one of that player's three scandals is placed in the middle of the board and auctioned off to the highest bidder.  The player who wins the scandal card may then try to expose it by first landing on a Press Conference square, and then making an accusation against the player whose scandal it is.  The accuser may choose to blackmail the accused and accept a cash payment in exchange for a temporary reprieve, or the players contest the accusation using Dirty Tricks.  If the accusation is successful, the scandal is removed from the game and the accuser gets $50 Million as a reward.  If unsuccessful, the accused gets a scandal back and receives $10 Million compensation.  Once all a player's scandals are exposed, he or she is out of the game.  If the player who owns the scandal gets to The Shredder before being accused at a Press Conference, he or she takes the unexposed scandal back.  Play continues until only one world leader remains with any unexposed scandals...  He or she is the winner!

9668,MooT,1998,6.50833,18,3,2,12,60,60,,Trivia Word Game ,,"Moot bills itself as the 'toughest word game ever'. Self-published, it has come in various boxes over the years, from cigar boxes to blue and silver cardboard.

Each team (or individual player when playing with a smaller group) rolls a 12-sided die. For 1-3, a Red question is asked, for 4-6 a Green one, for 7-9 a Yellow one, and for 10-12 a Blue one. Each question is worth the number rolled on the die.

The questions are devilishly hard and sometimes feature trick questions. Examples: Which part, the bowl or the grinder, is the mortar? In medieval times, the first hay cut in the season was called the Math. What was the second cut called? (Answer: Aftermath) Most deal with word origins and obscure knowledge. Each card also features a small tidbit of information about the answer.

The first player or team to get to 31 points is the winner. Replay value of the game is somewhat limited since only a single question set was ever produced, but the game is well worth picking up. A nice cerebral change from the usual Trivial Pursuit-type games.

9677,Exorbitare,1981,6,4,0,2,4,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area Control / Area InfluenceDice RollingRoll / Spin and MoveSimulation,"The game is based on the energy levels within an atom, and it is played on a board representing the Periodic Table of the Elements.  The squares making up the orbits are numbered according to the atomic numbers of the elements from Hydrogen (1) to radon (86).

The number of counters a player has depends on the number of players.  Two players have eight counters each, three players have six counters each, and four players have four counters each.

Players take turns to roll both dice.  The scores obtained on the dice may be used as a total, or as individual dice scores, to move the player's pieces to their best advantage.  For each six thrown, the player may move one piece into play, and roll that dice again.  The player does not have to move a piece into play unless he or she has no pieces in play already.

The players move their pieces along the track until they complete a circuit and land directly on a jump square.  When a piece lands on a jump square it is elevated to the next highest quantum level.  When a piece moves up a level, the controlling player gets an extra roll of one dice.

If a player's piece lands on the same square as an opponent's piece, Blatting occurs.  The piece that is Blatted moves down one energy level whilst the piece doing the Blatting moves up a level.  If a player's piece passes an opponents piece, Zapping occurs.  The piece that is Zapped moves down one energy level, but the piece that Zapped it does not move up.  A piece that is Zapped can Blat any piece that it lands on.  Thus both Blatting and Zapping are subject to chain-reaction.

To win the game a Quantum Jump must be achieved.  This is done by having a piece positioned on the yellow flash square, situated in the fourth energy band, at the same time as there are exactly half the total available number of player-counters in play.

On their turn, each player draws a question card, reads it out loud, guesses whether Zandar (an electronic talking version of the old Magic 8 Ball) will answer affirmatively or negatively, waves their hand over the top of Zandar's globe (to trigger a light sensor), and listens to his answer.  If they guessed correctly, they can either take a gem of their color from the pile and put it in front of them or place a gem of their color from in front of them onto the game board.  If they guess incorrectly, they must return a gem from in front them.

The other players can make a side bet during the turn and guess at Zandar's answer.  If they are right, they get a gem of their color.  If they are wrong, they must return a gem of their color.

There's a few other rules to the game, but that is main gist of it.  The first player to place 5 of their gems onto the game board wins and gets to have their fortune read by Zandar.

A highly random game meant mostly as a conversation starter for those playing.

1. The primary module is The Vizier's Favor, which allows players to buy a building out of turn but has to be paid with exact amount.

2. The Builders Huts (Die Bauhtte) introduces a number of new tiles that only count in the scoring when other tiles of the same color are built next to them. Hut tiles are free, but their number is limited to three per player.

3. With the The Currency Exchange (Wechselstube), players can buy building tiles by mixing different currencies.

4. The fourth module is a set of bonus cards that are dealt to the players. Each of the tiles shows a particular building. If the matching building is part of your Alhambra, then the bonus card can be revealed and will count as another building of that category.

Owners of the first edition of the game (titled only Alhambra) will notice that the color scheme of the Currency Exchange  does not agree with their currency cards: later editions of the game had differently colored currency cards that can be more easily distinguished from each other.

The board depicts colorful characters and places in Oz from the MGM movie, an annual television favorite to recreate Dorothy's magical trip through Oz.

Setup: give each player a pawn and set the 4 Magic Cards on Home.

Play is simple. Youngest player goes first. On her turn, the player spins the spinner. If the spinner points to a number, she moves her pawn that many spaces along the track:


     If the space her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has instructions for continuing the move such as to go ahead or move back a certain number of spaces, follow those instructions immediately.
     If the space her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has an M on it, the player receives a Magic card if she doesn't already have one, or returns her magic to the pile at Home if she does.
     If the space she lands on is already occupied (except Home - only Home may be occupied by more than one pawn), she must move her pawn back until she reaches an unoccupied space. When a player has to move back like this, any instructions on the space she moves back to are ignored.


If the spinner arrow points to Magic Card instead of a number, the player takes a Magic Card if she doesn't have one, or returns her Magic Card if she already has one.

Play continues until someone reaches Home with a Magic Card. If a player reaches Home, but does not have a Magic Card, she can stay there, taking her turn as usual until she spins a Magic Card or another player reaches Home with a Magic Card (or without and spins one first).

There no place like Home.

The IRON Brigade at this point, consisted of the following Units: the 19th Indiana Regiment, the 24th Michigan Regiment, plus the 2nd,  7th Wisconsin Regiments commanded by Brig.Gen. -Solomon Meredith, with elements of the 142nd  151st Pennsylvania Regiments. The 6th Wisconsin Regiment had been a part of the original Brigade but had been 'absorbed' due to previous losses into the other units while the 24th Michigan was added later on. They were also known as the 'Black Hat' Brigade due to their distinctive head apparel and were well respected among their foes  peers. There is an excellent photo-depiction of a 're-enactment' group in full uniform on the front cover of the game box complete with their 'ostrich plumed' hats!

The components consist of the following: a thin 'book-case' style cardboard box; a RULES Booklet; a 7-COLOR 17 by 22 paper Map sheet; 2-Sets of cardboard counters (200 total);  Players must provide their OWN (2)~6-sided DICE prior to playing. This is considered to be of Moderate Complexity according to its authors. The game scale is given as: 30-yards across per HEX; Elevation intervals of 10~20-feet; each Strength Point=15-Men; and 1-Turn=6-Minutes.

On the Map sheet are: the Battle Area of a portion of McPherson's Ridge about 1-Mile West of Gettysburg; the Sequence of Play; a Game Turn Track with the 2-Scenarios displayed (a separate Morning~7-Turns  an Afternoon~10-Turns);  a Terrain Key. There are (4)-shades of BROWN to depict varying Elevations as well as Light TAN for the lowest, BLUE for Stream,  GREEN for Woods, while Fences  Contour lines are in BROWN. The Game counters are printed Front  Back with Light BLUE with BLACK print for the Union,  Light GRAY with RED  BLACK print for the Confederates (RED-Morning Scenario, BLACK-Afternoon), and WHITE with RED  BLACK print for informational, replacement Officers,  Strength Point markers. The counters also have various 'Hat'  'Cap' silhouettes on them to represent the Unit types while some of the informational ones have a soldier(s) silhouette(s) on them for dispositions such as 'Charge', 'Melee', 'Volley Fire', etc.

The RULES detail the Historical background by Dr. David G. Martin, with a decent listing of reference materials. The last page contains the COMMAND Point Chart, MOVEMENT Point Chart, MORALE Table- (with Morale Modifiers detailed) while the REVERSE side of the page has the MELEE Combat Results Table, MELEE Combat Modifiers,  SPONTANEOUS Rally Chart.

9726,Electric Baseball,1979,3,6,0,2,2,120,120,,Action / Dexterity Sports ,,"The giant vibrating board is the same as in Electric Football, except the only real section that's used is the diamond. The diamond is a track in which a plastic base runner can move around the bases. The batter turns on the board to have his batters run, and turns it off to have them stop at a base.

Attached to one end of the field is a large metal fence, which includes the scoreboard and an area above which home runs can be hit. The other end of the field has a smaller metal shield, containing a replica of the strike zone.

The pitcher must use a plastic arm to flick a small magnetic chit (the ball) onto this shield. Behind the shield, the batter must try to figure out where the ball landed on the shield -- and can either take the pitch (for a strike or a ball) or whack the back of the shield with a different plastic bat. If the bat is struck near the ball, the ball will generally fly further -- sometimes even hitting your opponent in the face.

The rest of the board is the ball field, with clearly marked sections for outs where the fielders are. If the ball is smacked anywhere else, the fielder must flick the ball into the base areas with the pitching flicker, before the runner gets there.

The game board is illustrated with a network of many nodes: four are starting points and one is the finishing point.  Starting with a colored personal token and six grey neutral tokens, each player's goal is to move his or her personal token to the finishing point.

The nodes are interlinked by directional gateways.  A node can have only one entry route from another node, but it might have exits to two others.  Token movement follows the rule that to enter a node, all entries through the gateway must be occupied, and its exits clear.  Players take turns to place their tokens and move everyone's tokens if movement conditions are satisfied, taking back neutral tokens under certain circumstances.

The first player to reach the finishing point wins.  The game ends at that point if the players agree, or they can play till all positions are decided.

In this roll-and-move children's game, players move along a winding path picking up Gold Doubloons which will allow them to acquire extra Bags of Gold at the Water Tower before racing to the Finish Line. The goal is to be the first to reach the Finish Line with at least 1 Bag of Gold.

Game Play
On your turn, roll the die, then move your pawn that number of spaces. After the first turn, you can choose to move either forward or backward, but you can never land on an occupied space. If you can't move the full number on the die in either direction without ending on an occupied space, you forfeit your turn. If you land on a space marked Message Card, take a message card and follow its instructions.

Along the track to the Water Tower and Finish Line, you can make detours to pick up gold doubloons. You do not have to roll exactly to reach a gold doubloon space, you can end your movement on the gold space and attempt to acquire it by rolling the number next to it. If you are successful, pick up the gold. If not, you'll have to return to the main track on your next turn, then try again if you want.

When you reach the ladder to the Water Tower, you move up the ladder toward the top space marked Take Gold. You must reach the Take Gold space by exact roll. Once there you can take one Bag of Gold, plus one additional Bag for each doubloon you've collected.

Then it's back down the ladder and a race to the Finish. Once you enter the area between the Water Tower and the Finish, you can not move back out of it. Watch out for the Black Spaces. If you land on a Black Space without a Bag of Gold on it, you'll have to place one of your bags of gold on it. If, however, there is already a Bag of Gold there, you can claim that Bag of Gold.

The first player to reach the Finish, by exact count, with a Bag of Gold, wins the game.

9757,Count Your Blessings,1979,6.5,2,0,2,6,20,20,,Religious ,Roll / Spin and MoveSet Collection,"Count Your Blessings is a board game that takes players through life, encouraging them to accomplish certain things for spiritual gain while managing their finances.

Players take turns to roll a die and move their tokens, executing instructions on the space their tokens land on.  Most of the time, they have to pay money, which is usually gained from the Pay Day space.  Players can also buy businesses and earn income from other players who land on those spaces.  Loans can be taken if money is insufficient, but too many loans lead to bankruptcy, which will hurt a player's final score.

Blessings, used for scoring, are mostly gained by achieving accomplishments.  Most accomplishments (getting a diploma, attending church, etc) are gained by landing on the spaces required.  Some require players to have visited another space (e.g. to get married, one must land on BYU Square, pay $15,000, then proceed to the Temple Square).

When landing on a Spice of Life space, players draw a card and follow the instructions printed, which can be beneficial or detrimental.  Some cards offer choices: a player can either gain cash or Blessings, or possibly mull over which to sacrifice.

Blessings are scored for a player when he or she lands on the Interview Square.  The game ends when a player has three Interviews; the player with the highest total score (from three Interviews) is the winner.

The 1985 version by Ungame is simpler in design.  It has fewer spaces on the board and does not have events that require players to track to different spaces to gain Blessings.  The first player to obtain a Gospel card (obtained by landing on a square) and have at least 50 Blessings (the number can be adjusted on agreement) wins and ends the game.

These are: Poland-1939; The Balkan Campaign-May,1941; Barbarossa-June, 1941;  Kursk, Summer-1943. Plus the entire Eastern Front Campaign-1941~1945. For those most adventurous folks, they can even combine ALL the 3-parts for one massive, full-fledged, all-consuming game of their lifetimes!

The object of the game is to dig through the piles and collect most of the seven treasures.

The cards are divided into items and obstacles. On each of your turn you are allowed to encounter up to two cards. If a card is an item you may take the card and turn the next card face up. If it is an obstacle you must pay a price to get through it, often using your collected items. The obstacle Door needs the item Key, the obstacle Thief steals a random item from you. There are 7 different items and 7 different obstacles in the game.

Boards 42 and 43 - the newest geomorphic mapboards for wargaming's best tactical-level World War II simulation - are the centerpieces of this latest innovation for the ASL game system: the ASL Action Pack. Designed to get you right into the action, these Packs consist of boards and scenarios that further expand the ASL game system without requiring new rules sections.

Board 42 depicts a small village crossroads: stone buildings, walls, hedges, and orchards are complimented by ponds, grainfields, and woods. 
Board 43 has the feel of a farm compound surrounded by large grain fields; the open terrain is sure to provide great fields of fire for your marauding armor.

Eight new scenarios were specifically designed for use with these new boards. The actions in these battles span the length of the war-from 1939 to 1945-and the length of Europe-from Poland to Sicily, from Russia to France. Also included in the package is a color-coded flow chart to help you through the somewhat complicated OBA section of Chapter C.

ASL Action Pack #1 is not a complete game. Ownership of ASL, Beyond Valor, Yanks, and The Last Hurrah is required. Additionally, one of the eight scenarios requires the Italians (Hollow Legions) and board 10 (Partisan), one requires the Japanese (Code of Bushido), and one requires board 38 (Gung Ho).

Scenario list:

    AP1 The Ring - Germany 20 April 1945 - Russians vs Germans
    AP2 Storm of Steel - Russia 5 July 1943 - Russians vs Germans
    AP3 A Breezeless Day - France 2 January 1945 - Americans vs Germans
    AP4 L'Abbaye Blanche - France 7 August 1944 - Americans vs Germans
    AP5 Invisible Foes - Philippines 5 May 1945 - Japanese vs Americans
    AP6 Savannah Rain - Sicily 11 July 1943 - Americans vs Germans/Italians
    AP7 Directive Number Three - Russia 27 June 1941 - Russians vs Germans 
    AP8 Bloody Harvest - Poland 7 September 1939 - Polish vs Germans

http://home.earthlink.net/~thepatriotactgame/index.html

It's kind of fun as well as informative. It seems to be pretty soundly researched, based on actual analysis of the Act and, more generally, some history of civil liberties issues.

Here's a sense of how it goes: the currency is freedom fries, the homeland security threat level rises during the course of the game, the players whose game tokens are black or brown or yellow get screwed in comparison to those who have the red, white, or blue tokens -- stuff like that. Even if it doesn't make it into the board game hall of fame, it could be a good gift for the civil libertarians on your holiday gift list.

In order to fill their program of visits, tourists will travel by taxi.

The more people sharing a taxi, the less expensive it is, but the taxi then goes slower because its filled!

On the other hand, if you want to ride in a beautiful new American taxi, your taxi will go more quickly but the price will be higher.

Will you find the proper compromise when you make your choices? You mark points by visiting the most monuments possible. To win, it will constantly be necessary to try and arrive at a balance between your desire to travel alone and go quickly, so you can get to as many points of interest as you can, and the budgetary constraint that will force you at one time or another to share the leather bench of your taxi with other noisy tourists!

While all the other players close their eyes, the active player for the round removes one object from play, hiding it in her hands under the table, for example. All of the other players then search the table to try to decipher what's missing, yelling out the answer as soon as they think they know. If correct, that player places a raven token in the box; if not, the player receives another raven token, but can continue to play that round and guess again.

Whoever runs out of raven tokens first wins! A variant for younger players reduces the number of objects on the table to thirty, that is, three of each object instead of four.

There are twelve Offense Cards and nine Defense Cards. Each players chooses a card secretly. The player on offense then declares whether the play action will take place on the weak side or strong side. The player on offense rolls three six-sided dice and the player on defense rolls two six-sided dice. The die rolls are modified by the play choices and the resulting yardage is the modified offensive roll minus the modified defensive roll. Results of the plays are recorded using a grease pencil on the laminated gameboard.

To get instructions concerning penalties and organizing a league, one would have had to contact the now defunct publisher.

9828,Battle of Atlanta: War Centennial Game,1960,5,1,0,2,2,120,120,Wargames,American Civil War Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterSimulation,"Interesting game in the Avalon Hill mode published in 1960. Mounted mapboard and cardboard counters.  As described in the rules:

Battle of Atlanta War Centennial Game is a war game featuring the Atlanta Campaign of 1864, and also includes other war games centered around the East Tennessee and Northern Georgia battles of 1863-1864.  These are games that both teenage and older players can enjoy.  Having military experience is no advantage-- the methods of play are definite, decisive and easily mastered.

The game board, while rudimentary, includes rivers, mountains, high ridges, railroads, roads, streams, towns and cities.  Each side has a number of counters representing infantry, artillery, cavalry, locomotives and headquarters, each with varying strength and movement capabilities.  The pieces are identified by number only (i.e., an infantry piece has a #4 on its face, and an artillery piece has a #2).  Movement is affected by terrain, as is battle strength.  The Union army wins the main game by retaining control of Chattanooga and capturing Atlanta.  The Confederates win by holding Atlanta.

The game is interesting in part because of its publication date.  There wasn't much competition for Avalon Hill in the early 60s, but fans of Avalon Hill's early games will immediately recognize elements of this one.

It's like a meaner but whimsical version of Go Fish. The inclusion of the action cards add depth and strategy to what otherwise would be a rather ordinary game. But the theming makes it a tad better, with the requirement to say Oh joy! and the Pick It! allusion to boogers as that which will keep fans of the series (or just of nosepicking) interested.

For many who have been to the isles, nostalgic memories will come; for many more, an entry will be made to the Paradise of the Pacific.

Kapu has a deck of 48 cards and score sheets provided in a simple black box. I am assuming that F. D. Lang is the designer, since that is the name on the copyright.

The game is called A Picture Story of Hawaii, and it is a matching game of making sets of cards. The cards are printed in full color, and they are all different. Many have point values of II, V, X, and XX (Roman numerals), but those are the only letters on the cards.

Kapu (kah-poo) means take or possess, and players try to kapu cards to make sets of the 12 hales (suits) or the 8 huis (clubs, as in groups).

The game is quite simple and somehow elegantly attractive. Play requires reference to the chart of matching cards provided, in a fashion something like Mah Jongg.

Campaign! was published in 1961 to reflect on the War Between the States.  The game board is made up of squares 18 long and 15 wide, with various battlefields interspersed among the blocks.  Each player starts with 72 wooden discs.  Each turn, a player rolls the dice and adds discs to his or her lines, attempting to surround the battlefields in order to get the points assigned to each battlefield. The battlefields are worth different points to each player, depending on the size of the battlefield and the distance from the player's home base.  The back of the board includes brief descriptions of the major battles of the Civil War.

 It is a blind bidding race game. Each player has 4 chips labeled A-D. A card is laid on each of the 4 tables pictured on the board. Players simultaneously bid by choosing the letter chip that matches the table the card they want is on.
 Each card shows food items, the number of items on the card is how much many spaces around the board the card winner can move. If multiple players bid on the same card, none of them win, and their chips stay on the board until after the next round of bidding. Players do not count spaces with other players tokens on them, so being in the back can be an advantage. A clever enough blind bidding race game from the author of Ave Caesar.

Stack up your dishes on Stretch-Out Sam's tray.  Press the lever and watch his arm stretch up,up and away.  Oh No!  The tray tips, dishes fall.  Now you'll have to keep them all.


The Stacking Game of Spills  Thrills

This game features Manuel the waiter, who has an incredibly long arm.  At the start of the game you wind Manuel's arm into his body, place a plastic tray onto his raised hand and you're ready to play.  Each player is then given the same number of dishes (but not necessarily the same of each type) and then, in turn, each player flicks a spinner which tells him how many 3D objects to place on Manuel's tray - plates, bowls, glasses, cups and saucers.

So far, it's just a simple balancing game.  But the spinner also tells you if you have to Tip The Waiter.  If you do, you have to reach behind Manuel and flick a lever which extends his arm a short distance.  The more the arm extends, the more unstable the tray of dishes becomes.  Eventually Manuel's arm tips and all the dishes fall off and are given to the person who caused Manuel to drop the dishes.

The object of the game is to get rid of all your dishes first.

Very similar in theme and name to Don't Tip the Waiter and Don't Tip the Waiter .

The game is played in pairs who take alternating roles: a lipper, who mouths the words and phrases, and a lipreader.

Each team takes turns to flick a spinner and move their lips token by the resultant number.  The color of the lips of the space the token lands on determines the category of the word or phrase for the round.  The spinner also points to the mode of play and the time limit for the round.  One mode has the team's lipper performing for all to guess, another mode makes the play private to the team.  Yet another makes it a free for all.  The lipper cannot make any sound or gesture; otherwise, his team forfeits its turn.

The first team to get two words in each of all 6 categories wins the game.

The focus of the game system is on initiative and command, with alternating formation activations (i.e., the German player activates one General's command, then the Soviet player activates one General's command, and repeat until all the units are activated).

This issue also includes counters for a scenario for Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, the batte of Sos.

The object is to be the first player to move two Scepters from your side of the board to your opponents.

Scepters are clear plastic pawns.  The board is 19x19 with a center square called the Falcon's Keep.  The center square is where a scepter is placed when it is captured.

Each player has 100 small gemstones to place on the board and which allow their scepter to land on that square.  Gemstones in each set are random.

Dice are in a clear plastic shaker.

Players move by making a mandatory move of one of their Scepters in a straight line from one gemstone to another.  It is possible to cross over empty spaces

Players then roll the dice and may choose to move their Scepter or place additional gemstones.  The Hop move can also be used to capture an opponent's Scepter.

The Scepter moves in a hop move to adjacent gemstones to a max number rolled on one die.  (The other die is then used to place a gemstone.)

Placing gemstones depends upon the number rolled on the dice and opponent gemstones can block placement.

9988,Solferino 1859,2004,6.86364,22,2.5,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Napoleonic Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Solferino portrays the final battle of the Second Italian War of Independence, a nominal French victory that persuaded Napoleon III to make peace without much attention to the aims of his Italian allies. It was the last battle in Europe (maybe in the world) in which three monarchs commanded armies: the little Napoleon for the French, Victor Emmanuel for the Sardinians and Franz Joseph I for the Austrians.

The scale is 600 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn. Units are infantry and cavalry brigades and corps-level artillery batteries. Units are rated for attack strength, movement factor and cohesion, which represents both morale and the number of losses that the unit can take before dissolving (2 for most infantry and cavalry, 3 for a few, 1 for artillery). Stacking is limited to one unit of any type plus one additional artillery unit per hex. Facing is of no importance for movement but does affect combat: Units may attack only through their 3 front hexes and are penalized if attacked from the flank or rear.

Command and control are of great importance. Most units are attached to higher level formations (corps for the French and Austrians, divisions for the Italians). A unit is in command only if it is within range of its corps/division headquarters and the HQ either is within range of its monarch or passes an initiative test. Out-of-command units aren't helpless but are barred from entering hexes adjacent to enemy units' fronts. The royal and imperial personages, particularly Victor Emmanuel and Franz Joseph, are not very mobile, thus limiting forward movement in what is essentially a huge meeting engagement.

The movement sequence uses the chit pull mechanism. Activation chits for each formation (plus a chit for each side representing all of its unattached units) are placed into a cup and drawn to determine which corps's or division's units may move next. The player who wins the initiative (usually the French) has the slight advantage of being able to select the first formation that will move each turn, without having to draw.

Combat is somewhat unusual, employing a system that makes attacks hard and bloody. The attacker's strength is compared to the defense value of the terrain occupied by the defender (1 for clear hexes, 2 for woods, villages and upper slopes, 3 for towns); the defender's strength doesn't matter. At first glance, the combat results table looks very favorable. There are two catches: First, unless an HQ stacks with one of the attackers and passes an initiative test, attacks cannot be combined. The brigades go in one by one. Second, the defender gets to use its own strength for defensive fire against each successive attack before the attacker may fire. A not untypical result of an uncoordinated attack is that each attacker in turn suffers disorder and is forced to fall back without doing any damage. Coordinated attacks work much better - the defender must divide its strength among the attacking units, while they get to add theirs - but, as noted, require the presence of an HQ, which risks the loss of its commander in the process. (He will be replaced, but by a less effective subordinate.) Artillery can help by softening up the target, but there aren't a lot of batteries. (Most of the guns present are abstractly incorporated in the infantry brigade strengths.). Worse yet, they move slowly, have trouble obtaining good lines of sight and are easily eliminated if they get too near the enemy.

As the battle goes on, formations will become demoralized through the loss of more than half of their initial steps. Once demoralized, they can do little except retreat off the field.

Players gain a Victory Point for occupying each of 7 towns and one for every two enemy corps or divisions demoralized. A side can also win instantly by eliminating the enemy Emperor (Napoleon or Franz Joseph), though only a rather careless player will expose his monarch to attack.

The battle starts at dawn (5:00 am) and will usually end abruptly in the late afternoon when a thunderstorm sweeps the field. If the storm holds off, the last turn is 6:00 pm. Whether or not it arrives, oppressive heat almost certainly will, slowing units and lowering their morale.

This game was announced as the first of the series, and a later issue of Vae Victis had a pair of sequels, covering the battles of Magenta (1859, the other big battle of the same war) and Reichshoffen (1870, Franco-Prussian War). There were, however, no more, either because the difficulties of attack frustrated aggressive players or simply owing to a lack of widespread interest in mid-19th Century European wars. Solferino gives us a glimpse of what the American Civil War might have been like if every general had been a McClellan.

You are a manager controlling the ring strategy of your fighter, balancing his punching power and offensive and defensive boxing abilities against those of his opponent. You can play two contemporary (1979) or all-time-great fighters creating many what-if? situations.
This is not a long-winded, overly complex game but was in the vanguard of beer and pretzels games before the German games invasion. You should be able to read the rules and play your 1st bout within an hour. Advanced optional rules can be added later for more realistic flavor.
Components are meager but complete. Included is a simulated boxing ring with 2 corners divided into sections for each fighter's stance of Aggressive/Counter/Defense. Also included are 2 realistic metal fighters (look great if you paint them), 2 Game charts, and a pad of score sheets, rulebook, 1D6, 20 Contemporary and 20 All-time-great fighter cards.
A turn consists of simultaneously: 1) Secretly choosing your stance, 2) rolling on the Boxing ability vs. stance chart for any punches landed, 3) rolling for each landed punch on the Punching power vs. defense chart for results, 4) recording points and stats on the score sheet, 5) roll recovery if needed and repeat sequence 3x for each round.
Advanced optional rules include Endurance, TKO, Injuries, Solitaire, Rope-a-dope, Haymakers, Clinching, Stuns, Head Butts, Tiring and everyone's favorite; add your own rule.

As such, one has at one's disposal missionaries to convert others.  However, one also controls the temporal power behind these faiths--the Shamanist player controls the Avars, the Franks belong to the Western Christian player, and so on.  Conquering other territories greatly increases the effectiveness of one's missionaries.

There are also a great number of minor religions, which also have their adherents.

There are two maps--one spiritual (showing the penetration of the various religions) and one temporal (showing the spread of the various empires).

As in Diplomacy, one writes orders secretly (after a round of negotiation) and all orders are resolved simultaneously, with combat as appropriate.

Game Auction is a satirical look at the wargaming hobby and the games, people, and companies that make up the hobby. With tongue firmly planted in cheek, I have designed a game that simulates all the fun and craziness of a live wargame auction. Based on MODERN ART, the game adds event cards that may be played on yourself or on an opponent during the course of an auction (and includes such cards as buying frenzy where your emotions take over and you want to buy anything that has cardboard and dice, or the ever popular Paranoid where a player has come to the conclusion that a person is bidding against him not for the game but to out bid him--it has become personal). The game also adds condition cards that are played after a round of auctions is completed. It simulates that moment when you finally open the box that you've just purchased. With condition cards, you can find anything from a designer's autograph to mildew. The game also comes with a complete description of the companies and games that are up for sale. You will run into companies like EGO Games, considered by many including themselves to produce the ultimate wargames, this company features some of the most famous personalities in the hobby. Renowned for their use (some would say abuse) of color, their games feature everything a wargame should have and a lot that isn't necessary.

Players take turns asking each other for cards matching the ones in their hands, each card being named after a particular fish (or fish-related being, such as Atlantean Priests or Mermaids). When a player manages to get a pair, they place it face-up on the table in front of them, just like in Go Fish. Once the cards hit the table, the Magic: the Gathering aspects come into play, as most of the fish have unique powers that can be used to aid you or annoy your opponents. There are also unique cards (with names like Flying Dutchman and Offshore Oil Rig), which have more esoteric powers and move from player to player as they get used. When one player runs out of cards in their hand, everyone scores a point for each pair they possess, and a new hand is dealt until every player has dealt once, at which point the final scores are tallied and a winner is declared. (Game time is thus dependant on number of players -- my guess of 90 minutes is a rough estimate of a 6-player game, which may not be at all accurate.)

In many ways, Leviathan epitomizes the beer-and-pretzels game -- in fact, it was designed in a coffee shop, out of a need for something to do while sitting in a coffee shop. The rules encourage a light (jovially rude) atmosphere, and the writing style generally reflects this, although careful attention has been paid to the way the various cards interact, and to fix any possible contradictions or loopholes. (And the rule set has been edited to remove unnecessary rudeness in the author's writing style, although -- shh! -- an impolite version of the rules is rumored to exist, somewhere...)

Players are encouraged to devise new card powers and game variations, and as a bonus for players south of the equator, a special Southern Hemisphere option is given, which explains the way the Coriolis Effect changes the order of play.

As the player turns the wheel, the turntable rotates the mouse.
As Claude, the cat, begins to moving around the gameboard, all players at the same time quickly turns their mousemover wheels, trying to keep their mice away from Claude's mouth. If a mouse is caught by Claude's teeth, then that mouse has been catnipped! All play stops.

The game uses 2 22x34 inch maps with 200 yards to the hex along with 940 counters representing individual regiments and artillery batteries along with all the leaders down to the divisional level.  The map covers quite a bit of the area around Gettysburg giving players plenty of room to maneuver.  While the game is at nearly the same level as SPIs Terrible Swift Sword, it does move more quickly due to somewhat more streamlined rules as well as an initiative system that randomizes whos going to move next and how long a turn will last.  There is even a random events chart that occasional allows a player to move and enemy unit or launch a free counter-attack.

From the rulebook:

The sequence of play is move-and-shoot, but initiative rules and a variable number of turns per day keep both players guessing.  The initiative rules help him who helps himself; once you gain an advantage, its in your best interest to keep the pressure on.  Combat stresses unit morale, but can turn bloody if both units stand and fight.  All-out charges can clear ground fast, but at the cost of much higher casualties.

This campaign is a hard row to hoe. It is the most difficult country in Europe, and yet we always get troops and equipment taken away from us for elsewhere. We have done all the fighting on a very narrow margin of relative strenghts.The battle of Rimini was one of the hardest battles of Eighth Army. The fighting was comparable to El Alamein, Mareth and the Gustav Line (Cassino). (Sir Oliver Leese)

The battle of Rimini had been as bitter as El Alamein and Cassino. (Sir Richard McCreery)

On the Apennines, south of San Marino, was fought the biggest battle in Italy: the names of Fano, Pesaro, Cattolica, Riccione and Rimini remain in the history of war. ( Beelitz and Heckel, German H.Q., Bellaria, Summer 1945)

The battle of Rimini, as characterised by concentration of material in a confined area, will take its place in history as an example of a battle of attrition in the grand style.. For the first time the German troops could conduct defensive operations in a major battle as laid down in the German manual Field Service Operations (Truppen Fuhrung) (Col. Horst Pretzell, German H.Q., Bellaria, Summer 1945)

The battle of Rimini has been the biggest battle of materials fought in Italy (Schffer  Wbbeking in Gen. Joachim Lemelsen '29.Division')

The battle of the Apennines is a famous page in the military history of Germany. (Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander Group of Armies 'C', South-West)

The XV Army Group performed a successful undertaking that surely has never been exceeded.The Gothic Line was stormed by the American 5th Army and by the British 8th Army. - (Retroversion from Sir Harold Alexander's  Memoirs)

10132,Gone With the Wind,1993,3.5,4,0,2,6,60,60,,Card Game Memory Movies / TV / Radio theme Trivia ,MemoryRoll / Spin and Move,"Gone with the Wind the Game consists of eight separate board, card and trivia games: Gone with the Wind trivia game, Atlanta, Carpetbagger, Frankly My Dear, Pay or Play, Rhett, Scarlett and Tara.

This particular game is a trivia board-game with a small twist. In addition to drawing cards and answering questions in your quest to win, this game includes two complete decks of playing cards. These form the 104 question cards, but can be used as regular playing cards as well. Instead of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds, we have Scarletts, Rhetts, Mammies and Ashleys. There appears to be no correlation between the picture on the card, the subject matter of the questions, or the suit, but I'm sure I'm just not looking hard enough. The pictures are repeated on some cards, and not with regularity, so there must be something going on. Playing card collectors will like these decks.
In addition to the game itself, there are also rules for playing other games with only the cards, including variations on rummy and go fish, as well as other games that make use of the trivia questions.

The two large decks of question cards can also be used as regular playing cards. Standard suits have been replaced by Scarletts, Rhetts, Mammies and Ashleys. The art depicted on the cards is independent from questions. The rules for card games include variations on Rummy and Go Fish.

10147,Are You... Over The Hill,1986,2.5,4,2,2,8,20,20,,Bluffing Card Game Trivia ,Betting/WageringSet Collection,"OVER THE HILL is a Poker variant with a trivia element thrown in.

The game contains a pack of playing cards with 12 cards of each value from 1 to 6. The first player is dealt a hand of 5 cards which he looks at before declaring the value of his hand (hands are valued in the same way as for Poker Dice - Four of a kind beats a Full House, beats a Straight etc). The player must declare at least a pair. This declaration can be true or false.

Following the declaration all the other players get the opportunity, in turn, to challenge the declaration. If no-one challenges then the hand is passed to the player on the left. This player may replace up to three cards by drawing from the deck, and then declares the value of his hand. This new declaration must be higher in value than the previous declaration. Play continues like this until there is a challenge.

When challenged the player holding the cards must expose his hand for all to see:
- If the player holding the cards was telling the truth then the player that challenged must answer a question from the Over the Hill deck of trivia cards.
- If the player holding the cards lied then he must attempt to answer an Over the Hill question.

The question cards come in six categories (Body, Fashion  Beauty, Health, Money, People and Leisure)- the subject being selected through the roll of a die.

Successful answering of the question results in no penalties being incurred, but if the question is not answered correctly then the card is retained by the person who answered incorrectly as a penalty.

The aim of the game is to avoid going Over the Hill - you are considered to be Over the Hill when you have collected four different question cards (i.e. from four different subjects) as a result of answering questions incorrectly.

In the game, players try to guess their opponents secret wishes as they move around the board. Each player starts the game with two wishes. On their turn, players roll a die and move the corresponding number of spaces. They must then follow the directions for the space on which the marker lands. On spaces, players may ask questions, go to the well, collect pennies from other players, give pennies to other players or exchange wishes. When asking questions, players can ask whether another player has a wish of a given color, one of two wishes of a given color or a specific wish of a given color. Players may ask questions by paying pennies (free on some spaces) as long as they receive Yes for an answer. When a player guesses correctly, he can pick up from the wishing well the number of pennies rolled on a die. Players whose wishes are guessed lose these wishes but have the opportunity of buying more of them until all wishes have been used up.

The last player to hold a secret wish wins.

From the box
Join Holly and your friends as you try to guess the secret wishes that are held by the other players.  You'll move around the wishing well, pay a penny and ask a player about a wish.  Every time you guess a wish you can try to empty the well.  Pay close attention and remember what everybody says because the player with the last secret wish is the player who wins the game.

Freikorps is a simulation game of a hypothetical invasion of Germany by the Soviet Union's Red Army of Workers and Peasants in 1920. The game is for two players, one representing the irresistible forces of proletarian revolution (the Red Player), and the other the (hopefully) impervious alliance of anti-Bolshevist forces that would have been arrayed to oppose such an invasion (the White Player).

The 11 x 17 map covers Poland and eastern Germany from Warsaw to Berlin. The 280 counters show Red Army and German Freikorps units, as well as Spartakists (German Communists), interventionists and the remains of the Polish army.

This game was first published in DTP format in 1999 by Microgame Design Group.

The Design Specification for Final Score demanded a quick-playing game (15 to 20 minutes per match), accurate results (of course), an exciting and smooth-flowing play system and the feeling that individual players were just as important as the overall team performance in arriving at the result.

For speed of play the game has to be a 'highlights' system.  We decided on a deck of Fast Action Cards to provide the smooth flow, and we rejected a playing pitch [board] as being unnecessary.  The basis of the system is the re-creation of the potentially decisive duels, between individual players, team strengths and tactics, that punctuate every soccer match.

The game includes team and player cards for sixteen prominent postwar English league teams.

10249,Land of the Free,1995,6,2,0,2,3,90,90,,Civil War Political Spies/Secret Agents ,Area MovementDice Rolling,"From the Box:

Land of the Free is a simulation of the political turmoil in America during the period of the Great Depression, 1930-1941. The economic devastation caused by the financial irresponsibility of the Roaring Twenties created massive job losses, business failures, and a crisis of confidence in the political institutions of the day, including democracy itself. Many people sought a solution to their problems through simplistic set the world right in ten lessons schemes such as the Technocracy or Social Credit movements, but others put their trust in radical political movements of the far left and right such as the German-American Bund organization, the Wobblies, and the Communist Party. Still others learned the value of simple corruption and demagoguery, as Governor Huey Long did in Louisiana.

In the game, two or three players represent extremist political organizations trying to gain power through covert means, at regional and (when they are strong enough) at Federal level. A process of patient organization and propaganda will result in an accumulation of influence, which will translate into power, which has its own rewards. It is also possible to try and muscle ones way into power by intimidation and strong-arm tactics.

Historically, this game lies somewhere between realism and fantasy.  Players try to build committees and fronts, gain control of the local police, aim to gain political control of the states, and eventually influence the national elections for President.  Along the way there are mobs, vote-rigging, and assassinations  Maybe Upton Sinclair will be elected governor of California this time . . .

The game comes with 280 counters and an 11x17 map of the continental United States divided into 20 regions (combinations of individual states in to regions with names like Minneconsin and Kennesee.)

Each Armati army can be assembled in three sizes, so that players may build them to suit both their financial resources and desired look. 130 armies are included, divided into six periods, thereby permitting a greater array of eligible opponents within each period. the game is mechanically simple - a battle can be fought in less than two hours even when using the advanced rules.

Armati emphasizes careful battle-planning and execution on the part of the player-general, as modified by the particular army system the general commands. Armati stresses the tactical generalities inherent in warfare rather than the exceptional battlefield occurrences in particular battles. To reduce the advantages of a player's helicopter view and to provide a more believable simulation of ancient warfare, Armati does not permit the free-wheeling unit maneuvers common to other rules sets. Unit movement is controlled, especially when in close proximity to the enemy. the General's plan of battle is critical to success because it cannot be altered from moment to moment.

Armati represents soldier types based on their tactical usage rather than their weapons and armor, although equipment contributes to a unit's fighting efficiency. Armati's combat system emphasizes tactical situation management not theoretical weapon effectiveness.

Now, it is possible for everyone in your family to enjoy all the fun and excitement of one of television's newest and highest rated shows with the new home version of The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime game. Players compete against one and other to solve the clues which will allow them a try at the word puzzle board.

All cards, except the winning set, are then collected, shuffled and a new hand is dealt. Any player who receives the Manara card may put it down in front of him and receive a new card from the pile immediately.
After 10 deals the players now have a number of sets in front of them and scoring begins. Each set of 3 scores 1 point. If a player have all 6 cards of one color then he receives a bonus point. The player with the Manara card in front of him also receives a bonus point.

- 15 fully fleshed-out, over-the-edge, play-balanced bodyguards (Like a cybernetically reconstructed Tyrannosaurus Rex with more gun mounts than a naval cruiser, or a living munitions depot for on-the-go arms distribution) for recruitment into each players 3-man squad.

- Easy-to-reference charts, so you dont have to stop to write anything down or flip back through the manual.

- 3 sheets of fully-colored counters, representing wounds, fatigue and in-game positions.

- An atmospheric setting chronology, in case youre interested in what stakes are at hand.

Game length averages from 1 to 2 and a half hours. Recommended for players 14 years of age or older.

The Game
Each player has a blank comic strip in front of them. The counters are placed in the box, thus creating a Log Cereal Box. The History Eraser strip is placed in the middle of the table.
In a turn, a player reaches in to the Cereal Box and pulls out a counter. If it is the same colour as your comic strip, you add it to your strip. If it is a History Eraser counter, add it to the History Eraser comic strip in the middle of the table. If it is none of these things, place it back into the cereal box and shake the box well.
If you pull out a log, various things might happen. All players might have to slide their comic strip to the person on their right or left. Or you might be able to take one counter of another player's comic strip and put it back into the box. And so on.
One really annoying rule - if you draw one of your comic strip counters, before you add it to your strip you must quote a line from the show indicated on that particular counter. If you cannot or will not do this, you don't get to keep the counter - it goes back into the box.
The first player to complete their strip, wins.
However, if the History Eraser comic strip is completed before any player's strip, then the game is lost by all players.
For die-hard Ren  Stimpy fans only.

While everybody is loving this break from the eternal heat, there is one problem: the Devil can't find his winter coat. He swears he put it in his closet after his last ski vacation in the Alps. But, it's been an eternity since then, and how often does he really need his winter coat in hell anyway?

Your task is to find the Devil's winter coat before he gets his panties in a bunch.

Players race their penguins around Antarctica in a mad dash to catch some fish and return to the Penguin club.  But watch out...another player can freeze you and stop you in your tracks.  That's where the excitement begins.

The hungry penguins roll the die and waddle around the board to reach the Fishing hoels.  When they land exactly on one of the squares with fish printed on them, they catch a fish of that color and move it to their Fish Freeze.  Each time that they catch a fish, penguins msut return to the Penguin Club through one of the four blue entrances marked Start.  Penguins must catch the fish of their own color last.
 Penguins who land on or next to another penguin can freeze that penguin by covering it with a Freeze-Tag Ice Cube.
 Frozen penguins stay frozen, and may not move, although they roll the die on each turn.  On the turn that they roll either a one or a six, frozen penguins thaw out, and roll again and move.  Penguins get an extra turn whenever they freeze another penguin.
 Penguins may move in any direction that they choose, although they may not move diagonally or move through a square that they already moved though on that turn.  Penguins who start their turn on a Swimming Hole may move to any other Swimming Hole, then roll and move.
 To reach a Swimming Hole, the Penguin Club, or one of the squares with a fish printed on them , penguins must roll the exact number of squares needed.  Swimming Hole spaces and the Penguin Club count as one square.  The first penguin to catch one fish of each color and return to the Penguin Club is the winner.

A simple luck driven children's game based on the Egyptian pyramids.
What is very unique in this game, is the turntable device. It operates as a dice, dictating the moves of the players, and at the same time it opens and closes the traps, causing some pieces to fall into the snake pit and start again.

Additionally when the turntable moves some windows will show the Pharaohs eyes in one of these 3 positions:

OPEN = trapdoor is open
HALF CLOSED = the trapdoor might open next turn
CLOSED = the trapdoor will not open next turn

Each pirate sails his ship around the game board recovering treasure chests which contain varying amounts of gold. The game ends when a pirate with at least one treasure chest sails across the finish line. That pirate gets a bonus for finishing first but does not automatically win the game. The winner is the pirate with the most gold. The decision to end the game is a risky one and the game remains exciting right up to the last move when all the pirates reveal how much treasure they have recovered and the winner is determined. In this 'nautical' game, each pirate must 'sail' his ship to where the treasure chests are. Each pirate chooses the direction to sail his ship on the hexagonal board and which treasures to go after. How many spaces he can move in each direction depends upon the direction the wind is blowing. He can sail more spaces if he goes with the wind and less if he sails on an angle into the wind. Since the direction of the wind changes according to the roll of the dice, and is somewhat predictable, a good part of the strategy of the game is learning how to use the wind in order to sail your ship to where the treasure chests are. No special prior knowledge of sailing is needed.

Cuban Missile Crisis is a simulation of that crisis, where players, acting as Kennedy or Khrushchev (along with their staff), must confront the issues and either arrive at a peaceful solution or end in a holocaust.

An innovative approach to simulator the Cuban Missile Crisis in which players use cards denoted specific alert statuses and actions that allow players to win the game without ever actually going to war (which was historically the case).  The American player must use his recon resources to uncover all the Soviet assets in Cuba while building up his forces for a possible invasion.  The problem is ending the threat to the US posed by the Soviet weapons in Cuba without provoking World War III.

The 4th and the last dealings are called direct: only words can be formed (no groups or sequences), and the winner must get rid of his last card without discarding it. After each dealing points are awarded based on the matches made (cards with hard letters give are worth more).

It's a fun game for families or groups of friends who enjoy word games.

From the back of the box:

GRAPHOS is an  intriguing  game that combines letters, colors and numbers. With a little luck and a lot of thought, players seek to build groups, sequences and words that are required for each dealing. 
Gradually, dealings become more defiant, requiring increasing mental agility for envisioning that combination.

It is a time of legends, an earlier time when men are just beginning to learn the art of war. It is a time for conquerors and warlords. On fierce battlegrounds, brave warlords go out to tame and protect new domains from other would-be rulers. Each ambitious leader tests a lifetime of military training against other fierce warlords. Which commander will emerge victorious?

Come back to a time when mighty conquerors and warlords clash in great battles for land and honor. As a commander, you either lead your troops to heroic victory or suffer ignoble defeat! Conquer new territories and guard them from warlords striving to wrest away what you have earned. Each enemy, each battle, calls for a different strategy. Is brute military force enough to protect your domain? Will your opponent honor your offer of truce? Would a sudden cavalry raid or archery barrage pay off?

You can conquer the world! Choose your strategies wisely. Each victory will bring you one step closer to glory, but only one player will emerge triumphant. Do you build great cities to feed and protect your people, conquer land and the valuable resources it contains ot build mighty armies with which to defeat your foes? Failure means certain defeat at the hands of your enemies. The time is yours, fight on!

The pressure on the Germans is to set up a defense that will prevent the Allies from taking the radio station in the alloted time - they also need to defend their supply dump, as once they lose it they cannot raise new units or attack anymore.  The Allies need to take ground, but they must be careful not to spook the Germans into blowing the radio station before they can capture it.

Units stacked with a leader are deployed on a hidden unit display and a traditional odds ratio CRT is used.  As the units present in this campaign are inexperienced, casualties are quite heavy in combat, with one side generally being wiped out.  An attack can be modified for the presence of entrenchments, machine guns or artillery, all of which played a role in the battle, and a successful attacker can see his units advance and attack again in the same period.

Each hex is 15 miles, each game turn is two to three days (there are nine turns in total) and each unit is a platoon, company, combat group, artillery section or machine gun section.

In a four player game, players are dealt 10 cards. Each player then puts one card face down on a yellow space found on the game sheet. On their turn, players put one of their two markers on a small number space (1 to 7) or on a Bonus picture space (All 0's, All 1's or All 2's). Once each player has placed one marker, the process is repeated so players can place their second marker on an unoccupied space. Cards are then turned face up and the total value of the four cards is added up. If there is a marker on the winning number, its owner wins the round and picks up the four cards which he places face down in front of him. When all four cards are the same, this is a Munster combination. If a marker is placed on this combination, its owner collects the four cards and a 10 points bonus.

Scores are added once all cards have been used. One point is scored for each face down card in front of the player and 10 points are scored for each Munster combination. The player with the highest score wins.

token and leave it there, face up for all to see.

10541,Brit Quiz 2000,1999,5.75,2,0,2,6,60,60,,Trivia ,Roll / Spin and Move,"An updated version of the original Brit Quiz game...  There are some new questions, and a slight modification to the rules.

Players take turns to roll a die and move their token that number of spaces round the board.  The player then tries to answer a question determined by both the colour of the space he or she lands on, and the actual number rolled on the die.  If the question is answered correctly the player moves forwards an additional three spaces as a reward.  There is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.  'Up The Creek' is a special category that asks the player to perform an activity as well as answering a question.  If the player answers an 'Up The Creek' question incorrectly he or she must move backwards three spaces.  If the player fails to carry out the activity to the satisfaction of the other players, or refuses to even try, he or she has to move backwards an additional three spaces.

The winner is the first player to complete a circuit of the track around the board.

Question categories are:

Yellow - People
White  - This And That
Green  - Showbiz
Blue   - History
Red    - Sport
Orange - Up The Creek

10542,Roolz,1996,8,3,0,2,6,20,20,,Card Game ,Auction/BiddingTrick-taking,"An ambitious card game based on elements of Hearts, Bridge, Spades, and Pinochle. The deck consists of six suits ranging from 0 to 15, a High Rooler card, a Low Rooler card, and two blank cards.

The game is usually played with teams. Players bid in five-point increments from 170 to 300. After everyone passes once, the winner chooses two trump suits. High Trump beats all other suits, even Low Trump. Low Trump beats all suits but High Trump. The Roolerz now take their positions as least powerful, yet most valuable cards in their respective trumps.

Gameplay proceeds like most other trick taking games. Ordinarily, the highest card in the lead suit wins the trick. The only exception is when trump is played. In that case, the highest trump card wins the trick.

The blank card may be played at any time, regardless of what suit was led or how many cards of that suit the player has.

At the end of the round, points are tallied. Points are only given to players who have the following cards: 15 (scores 15 points), 14 (scores 10 points), 10 (scores 10 points), 5 (scores 5 points), and the two Rooler cards (30 points each). All other cards are worth zero points.

A team is set if it fails to win as many points as it bid. The first team to reach 1000 points wins.

For 2-, 3-, and 5-player games use a dummy hand. In 4-player games there are two teams of two, and in 6-player games, there are two teams of three.

The players' train token can each carry up to 2 cargo (represented by the Freight cards, which have designated origins, destinations, and payoffs).  Their owners move them from station to station based on the result of a die roll.  A train must land exactly on a station to pick up or sell cargo there.  If a train lands on a green Fortune space, its owner draws a Fortune card and follows its instructions.  Players start off with $50,000 and can borrow only from other players if their finances run low.  They are out of the game if they run out of money.

The game ends when all Freight cards have been delivered.  The winner is the player with the most money at that point.

To land requires that you line-up on the proper end of the runway and be able to touch down at the correct spot by careful card play. There is a trading phase where players can freely trade the Course cards which are used to move the aircraft. In the end game phase, once aircraft are in the controlled airspace around the airport, the players also have the option to steal a card from another player. An interesting combination of elements with an attractive presentation.

There are 2 (3) variants to play:
first: mix all (event=activity traffic) cards and flip them like memory - getting bonus points (energy chips) you must flip them in a matching (=increasing) sequence;
player with most energy chips wins; learn more about all about an airport .

Second (partly) cooperative: 
act as a flight controller; try to bring all of your 3 planes to their destinaton (full cycle - start/rise/turn/debark/back to the gate) using your energy chips. Best player == be the fastest one, but all players loose if there are still planes after all energy chips are used. The biggest challenge is not to block other players' movements, because each turn you must 'burn' an energy chip.

third: it's a mix out of one and two: Gain energy chips (memory) first, divide and use theme to move/control your planes.

There is also a solitary approach for the second variant (use as less chips as possible).

In 1944 the Germans expected Patton to lead the cross-channel attack at Calais. They were right... Pas de Calais features features the hypothetical Allied invasion of France at Calais in 1944, as well as the planned Allied operations Sledgehammer and Roundup of 1943, against the historical German defenses.

Scale is 1-2 days/turn (variable because of the Impulse system), 3 km/hex. Units are regiments/brigades.

The game has 2 19x27 maps, 300 counters.

The heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).

Players bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.

Losses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.

Low counter density, high maneuver. Medium-high complexity.

The goal in Canoe is to be the first to form canoes - i.e. patterns of exactly 4 of your pieces in an arc shape that includes two diagonals. Two are needed to win. To count, each canoe must be separated from your other pieces. The other player's pieces can only interfere by blocking positions of play, as there is no capture.

On your turn you may place, remove, or move one piece. But you have only a limited number of them to play.

The novel aspect of the game is that completion of your goal pattern normally requires you to remove your own pieces.

Zaroc is a 3-dimensional game for 2 players. The object is to descend from the heights in the back, down to the lowest pegs, and then jump off at an opportune moment, to ultimately control three of the winning spots.

The game starts with pieces arranged in alternation on the tallest pegs. A piece can move forward following pointers on the board, but only from the tops of the pegs. From a stack which does not fill a peg, a piece can only move sideways.

The catch is that one turn incorporates two moves, and you have the possibility of repositioning your opponents pieces as well as your own.

Players take turns moving their pegs, trying to move three of them onto a new disc of their choice to control it and thereby earn a corresponding token.

After moving a peg, the player sets, or resets 2 obstacles for the next player: One of his pegs locks a disc to prevent its turning, and a special marker blocks a line of movement.

You have become an Olympic athlete! Compete in nine different events to score points and win medals.

The game consists of a board, videotape, cards, plastic medals, and pawns. On your turn you watch a 10-15 second random video clip of one of the nine events. At the end of the clip is a section with rapidly changing point values. You then pause the VCR and score whatever points are shown, double them if the space on the board you are on matches the event you just watched. You will then be given the number of spaces to move your token on the board which represents a mountain with three different ski trails down it and ski lifts back up. You can begin to collect medals by accumulating 500 points in a certain event and then landing on a special space for that event to collect the next medal. The first to do this in each event gets the gold for that event, the next the silver, and so on. There are also spaces on the board that can set you back or have you draw a card. The cards can add to your score, set you back or be a lift ticket, which entitles you to move back up the board at any time. After all nine gold medals have been won the game is over and the player with the most points wins the game.

This is a great game for the whole family and the replayability of this game is very high. Even after going through the tape many times each game is still unique.

Do you have what it takes to win the gold?

In the partnership game the object of each side is to capture tricks.  Players have both Number and Money Cards and try to capture tricks where Money Cards have been played.  The side first scoring a total of a million dollars wins.  The privilege of naming trump color and collecting a face down widow go to the highest bidder.  Failing to meet a bid means that a partnership loses the amount of their bid from their score.

In addition to Number and Money Cards, players must reconcile with three special cards:  the Tiger, the Bull, and the Bear.  The Tiger card (the most powerful card in play) gives players an automatic highest trump, while at the same time functioning as a wild card.

10615,Herz an Herz,1992,4,3,2,2,4,0,0,,Card Game ,,"Theme
Almost non-existent. Cards are numbered and have hearts printed on them.

Goal
Gaining the most points by laying down cards in columns/rows in descending order.

Game play
There are 100 cards numbered 1-100. These cards are grouped into 4 groups of 25 (1-25, 26-51,...), with the groups being different from each other in background colour.
Additionally, there are four jokers (one for each colour; can be used as a number of your choice within that colour's range), two super jokers (that can be used as any number), and 4 thief cards (allow you to steal another player's lowest card and place it in your own display as long as its value is lower than the lowest card already in your display).
At the start of the game, some cards are removed if playing with fewer than 4 players. The remaining cards are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. 
Players take turns. On your turn, you draw the top card from the stack and decide if you want to keep or discard it.
The first card that you keep is placed in front of you in landscape orientation. Below this first card, you can later put additional cards. These are placed in two columns. Each card that you put down has to have a lower value than the previous card.

A round ends when

     a player has accumulated two rows with 6 cards each, or
     the draw deck has been exhausted.




Points are counted as follows:

     Each row with two cards counts two points.
     If both cards in a row are the same colour, you get an additional point.
     Complete rows with a coloured joker also get you a bonus points (rows with super jokers don't).
     Rows with only one card count zero points.




The game ends after 4 rounds, and the player with the highest total score wins the game.

Each player is trying to collect a different GoBot (either Leader-1, Royal-T, Cy-Kill, or Cop-Tur).

There are 31 oversized cards, and each has four pictures of GoBots. Two different GoBots are represented on each card. For example, a card may have two pictures of Leader-1, and two pictures of Cop-Tur. Or, it could have three pictures of Royal-T, and only one of Cy-Kill. (Cards always have either 2+2 or 3+1 pictures.)

On their turn, a player draws one card from the draw deck or the discard pile. If at least one of the four pictures on that card is of the GoBot that the player is trying to collect, they keep it and play if face up on the table. All of the cards a player collects are placed side by side, in front of him. If the card drawn doesn't pictures the player's GoBot, the player discards it face down.

There are also five Zap Cards. When a player draws a zap card, he places it on top of (covering, or zapping) any four pictures on an opponent's cards, either over one whole card, or overlapping it to cover one half of two different cards.

The winner is the player who is the first to collect ten pictures of their GoBot.

10624,EmotrionsOnCards,2003,3.9,5,1,2,6,15,15,,Card Game Educational ,PartnershipsTrick-taking,"EmotrionsOnCards is a strategy card game for all ages that belongs to the Emotrions line of games, which also includes board games (soon) and digital games (in development phase). The main feature of the Emotrions line is that it introduces the issue of Emotional Intelligence into a sector traditionally focused on the development of analytical intelligence.

EmotrionsOnCards is a really entertaining and addictive game. It's also easy to learn due to its few and consistent rules. There's a conscious balance between a distillate simplicity, which makes it possible for everybody to play in a more relaxed - light - manner, and a depth of game which will satisfy the classic strategy game hard players.

In EmotrionsOnCards, the cards, called emotrions, represent the basic human feelings: love, hatred, joy, sadness, fury, indecision... Some emotrions score points, others take them away. And they keep intermingling in your hand, when playing each trick, and even when you win!

It is very powerful as a strategy game. The miracle lays in its innovative logic, with negative and positive playing cards.

With only 36 cards and some minimal rules you'll be able to unfold many complex and shady situations. And you can also play different games with the same set of cards, such as The Pareo Game.

Strategy, psychology and luck 
EmotrionsOnCards sets off from a Standard style featuring a careful balance between Strategy, Psychology and Luck. But you may just as well alter this balance with The Winner's Options, to suit the winner of the previous hand. Thus, the most psychological players will prefer a more uncertain style, and the lovers of sheer strategy will demand a more analytical style. The possibility of modulating the game allows players with different profiles to enjoy, and feel the game as just right for them.

Philosophy
All the game is a carefully made metaphor on how we manage our emotions, and other people's, in everyday life. As you try to master the strategy, you'll learn that in order to win in the long run (the game), it is always necessary to consider the effects of a particular battle (stake/trick), even if it means losing it.

The ultimate goal of the game is to make us reflect on the fact that in real life there's no such thing as obviously good or bad situations, but more or less complex positions in which the thin line between success and failure relies on our managing little things. It is possible to win, even if we get a bad hand.

10632,Who Can Beat Nixon?,1970,4.71429,7,1.5,0,0,0,0,,Political ,Roll / Spin and Move,"This game was developed immediately after Nixon's first election, and apparently by someone who did not want him to get a second term.

It is a simple Monopoly-type game, but it has an interesting asymmetrical dynamic. Essentially, one player takes Nixon and up to seven play as challengers, with Nixon trying to knock them off one by one as Primary cards come up. Players still roll to land on states and buy them, and other players pay a fee when landing on them afterwards. But buying states requires a combination of two forms of currency: money and media points. Many state spaces also trigger event and media cards, which have different effects on Nixon and challengers.

Key to the game are the four Primary cards in the Event deck. Each time one of these comes up, Nixon rolls off with the top-ranking challenger, and whichever has the highest electoral vote total gets +2 on the 2D6. Loser is out of the game, winner grabs a state of his choice from the loser, and the rest goes back to the bank. There is a saved by the bell re-entry card in the deck that allows a loser to stay in the game.

There also is a provision for the challengers to join forces if Nixon seems about to win, but only if they can agree on which challenger should be the winner instead! The decks include blank Media and Event cards to allow players to customize the game.

Other players can poach questions to get rid of their own cards. First player to clear their hand wins.

Well produced but a standard party/quiz game.

The board is a 12x12 checkerboard with some squares marked as barriers which cannot be crossed. The player's pieces are marked with numbers from 3 to 24 and with orthogonal or diagonal crosses, which indicate the direction they may move.

After putting their pieces on the designated starting places, players move them any distance as allowed and try to strike opponents pieces off by landing. This is only allowed if the attacking piece has a higher value, but not allowed though if the defending piece is a divisor. So 12 could hit 10, but not 3. When their total value drops below 50, that player loses.

Political, dynastic, economic and military aspects of the conflict are covered and the growth of the Cathar heresy and its suppression by the Inquisition play their historical parts. If a faction has acquired sufficient power, represented by the number of its feudal holdings, it can do homage to the relevant sovereign and call on either the royal army of France or of Catalonia to intervene. In fact to achieve victory it must achieve this eminence as well as capture an enemy capital.

In a four-player game it is possible, suitable candidates being available, for a faction to ally with another by marriage and aim for a joint victory, unless Death do them part, albeit with more onerous conditions. The rules are modified slightly for two- and three-player games.

Caveat: This is a French-language production and there is some text on the event cards.

					Publisher's Description

The Munchkins take to the stars -- again!

Star Munchkin 2 brings the epic saga of The Clown Wars to life, except with better acting... Star Munchkin took the rules-bending, power-gaming, dungeon-crawling insanity of the original Munchkin and put the whole thing in space, where the monsters are more alien, the weapons more zappy, and the treasure -- well, there's still piles of treasure.

Strap on the Sprayser or X-Rayser and go ray-gunning for new monsters like the Nerds of Prey! Play a new race (the Bugs) or class (Space Ranger!), and do it all with Ralph, the Wonder Dog, by your side. Star Munchkin 2 -- The Clown Wars also has a new card type: Rooms. Just open the door, and... oh, noooooooooo...!

The Clown Wars is a supplement for Star Munchkin; you will need the original game to play. Or you could add it to a game of Munchkin (or any of the Munchkin family!) instead, or mix them all together for a Munchkin-fest of truly mind-bending proportions!

This game takes place in your own house. The board has several rooms which players mark on their score sheets as actual rooms in the place where you are playing, so the Red room might be your kitchen, the Green room might be your bathroom. Players then roll  move around the board and on entering a room another player draws question cards and letter cards from the relevant decks. So you might be asked To name something you might see in the sky... with the letter B. The player keeps answering questions and collecting letter cards if they give proper answers. If they fail, or take too long, their turn ends. You keep no more than 5 letters, so if you get a 6th letter, you return one you don't want.

Players also land on Rummage! squares, and must jump up, grab their letters and sprint off the the relevant room in the house. They then snatch objects from that room which start with the letter and return them to the game. So if you have the letter P and B and on the board are in the living room, you might bring back a piano and a buffalo, or maybe just a pencil and a book if that's what you find.

Other squares get everybody Rummaging, or have players swap their collections and sheets. First to get 5 different objects and reach the back door wins.

10701,Williams Renault Grand Prix Championship,1994,5.86957,23,2.5,1,6,10,10,,Economic Racing Sports ,Action Point Allowance SystemCard DraftingModular BoardVariable Player Powers,"The objective of this game is that as each player obtains sponsorship money they must invest it to build a Formula One racing team.

To do this, the players complete four laps of the Game Board before entering the first Grand Prix. Whenever a player lands on Car, Engine, Engineer or Driver squares, they can purchase these various elements to form a racing team.

Once a team has been formed, players then complete one lap of The Jigsaw Board. The Jigsaw board consists of six double-sided track sections, which can be combined in various ways to create all sixteen circuits around which the players will race. Clever.

Players move their cars around each circuit in procession. No dice rolls. The mechanics of racing come from overtaking lanes, which are positioned at critical points around the track. To overtake and improve your race position, you move your car into an overtaking lane and draw an overtaking card for either a straight and a corner. These cards list different elements that must be compared to the car you are overtaking.

For example, You succeed if CAR + ENGINE + ENGINEER ratings are higher.

This is the crux of the game. If you have assembled a team with high ratings then overtaking will succeed and therefore your team will succeed.
Whoever has the highest points after 16 races wins the championship.

10704,Grand Prix Championship,1978,5.14286,7,2,2,6,0,0,,Dice Racing Sports ,Dice Rolling,"...all the drama of F1 racing, pit stops, punctures, engine blow-ups restarts etc (From the back of the box)

Each player gets 2 cars, and they're pretty good: 5.5x3 cm, wheels that turn, not all cloned from one mold. It's a move-by-dice game with the die modified by cards you must pick up whenever you overtake an opponent on a bend. Mods include extra/lost spaces/turns, enforced/canceled pit stops, retirement, or (many) no changes. Some of those mods are whole positions rather than spaces - it must start getting a bit random and skill-less. The lap is 39 spaces long and the track is only 1 space wide with only 2 cars allowed per space so there's going to be lots of blocking: however it is obviously a 'ladder' game and not one where skill predominates over other factors to any great extent. One of the cards takes out the car you're overtaking as well as yours! A couple force a race restart.... You can forgo part of your move by declining to overtake in some situations, to avoid picking up a card. A few spaces on the straights have optional card pickup as well.
Shame there's not a big skill factor, because those cars are really nice.

There are 349 seats (mandates) up for grabs and the government can only be formed by a force with 175 or more seats.

On their turns, the players move their pieces on the board.  Most of the spaces on the board are Profile spots that give seats to the controlling party.  Players contest for these spaces by participating in a closed bid, using their Argument cards.  The values on their selected cards is added to the value of their party's color on the spot, and the party with the higher total value wins the Profile.  Players can also moving their pieces to the TV debates spot and try to bluff their way to win more seats.  The Chance spots instruct players to draw a Chance card, making them win or lose seats, or even swap electorates.  Players are free to wheel and deal in this game.

The game ends when all seats have been distributed.  The winner is the leader whose party has the required majority.  If no one has a majority, two players can join forces to achieve the required number and be joint winners.

A collection of 21 excellent games that are guaranteed to keep everyone guessing, laughing, weeping, or doing unspeakable things on the carpet!

All you need is a motley collection of consenting adults with more staying power than sense, and you're in for the night of your life! Serious fun for seriously fun loving adults who don't know when enough is enough!


     Pucker and Suck * Forbidden Fruit * Touch and Feel * Girls on Top * Hide and Streak * Sardines * Call my Bluff * Cheek to Cheek * Hot and Bothered * and many more...


From the introductory card:

This pack contains rules to 21 different late night games.

These games are perfectly suited to late-night revellers who just don't want the party to end: a few drinks have been drunk and inhibitions are starting to slip yet some people still have some sort of control over their limbs. These are games which encourage everyone to get to know each other just a little bit better. No-one would dream of playing them in the clear light of day of course, but market traders and merchant bankers alike all need to let their hair down sometimes and this is the ideal opportunity. So loosen your clothing and let's get playing!

A note to those easily offended:

The game titles (for the most part) are much more suggestive than the actual games (thought there are a few exceptions). For example, Pucker and Suck is simply a variation on the old Pass the orange by the neck party game using a credit card and your lips instead.

10717,Caveat Emptor,1971,6.6,5,3,3,5,60,60,,Economic ,Auction/Bidding,"Caveat Emptor is vaguely real-estate themed, with the board depicting a 7x7 array of lots, divided into sections of different sizes and shapes.  Each lot is also marked with a Roman numeral from I-V.  Players have sets of cards with the same numbers - on each round every player selects a card to be auctioned, but these are all shuffled together so no one knows exactly what will be available.  The gimmicks are that the winner of each auction can choose any like-numbered lot to own, and that the winning bid goes to the person who played the card, but no one knows who that is until the auctions are over.

Each lot has an intrinsic value based on the size of the section it is in, the bigger the section the more valuable.  However, a player can double or triple the value of his or her lots in a section by owning a majority or all of them, which is of course easier to do in a small section.  When a section is full the lot values are put into accounts for each player - these accounts earn interest every round, and the players are allowed to add a certain amount of cash to them as well.  The interest can be significant but withdrawing money from the account before the end of the game is somewhat painful.

The game has 6000 questions (500 for children) about news published on past editions of the magazine Veja in six categories: economy and businness, general knowledge, world, arts and entertainment, sports, Brazil.

The gameplay is very simple: each player receives a pawn and a booklet of questions. Each turn the current player must throw two six-sided dice: a numerical one (10, 20, 30) and a colored one. The player on the left must open the booklet and ask a question of a certain type (10, true or false; 20, multiple choice; 30, direct question) about the category indicated by the colored dice. For instance, if the result of the dice are 20 and green, the player on the left must ask a multiple choice question about Brazil. If the current players gives the correct answer he must move his pawn 2 green spaces ahead. If the answer is incorrect the pawn is moved one space back. In the last part of the board the players must answer questions about all subjects and move their pawns only one space ahead for each correct answer.

The game ends when the one of the players reachs the final space on the board.

The solving player moves a detective figure around the board (which shows the floor plan of a small mansion and garden) encountering characters and looking at their clues.  The setter gets turns to move characters to get away (presumably) from the detective.  The object is to solve the mystery in as few turns as possible - as in other games of this type it is always played twice, with the roles reversed for the second game.

The pieces really make the game - the characters are large Lucite blocks with simple pictures on the fronts and metal circles on the backs - the clues are on small magnets which attach to the circles.  In addition, a piece of red plastic is provided to serve as the pool of blood in which the victim is found.

There is also a wild suit which has the difficult letters, one of each vowel, and three totally wild cards.

Rules are included for a number of different games, mostly adaptations of traditional card games (there's Cardz Rummy, different versions of Cardz Poker, etc.).  The game that isn't an adaptation of a card game is very similar to Upwords.

A Kidz Cardz set was also sold - this has the same deck and many of the same games, but removes the rummy and poker games and adds some simpler ones (one based on war, for example).

The background of the game is of some interest.  It was invented by Hannah Cannon, a 12-year-old girl whose father formed a company to market it and managed to get a fair amount of publicity for it - Hannah was interviewed on Good Morning America and got a one-page writeup in People magazine.  (Her father, Doran William Cannon, is a former screenwriter who seems to be good at promotional activities.)  It was supposedly sold in places such as Waldenbooks and Bloomingdale's, but references to it are hard to find now.

Each player has a hand of 12 cards. Seven of the cards match the seven spaces on the board, which illustrate the story sequence of the movie. Four of the cards form a puzzle that shows the Baseball Diamond. One card is a thief card.

The players start with four cards in their hands and draw a card, then play a card each turn. There are four play options. A player may play a story card if it matches the next empty space on the board. A puzzle card may be played in front of the player. A thief card may be played against another player to have all of that player's puzzle card showing placed in a discard pile for that player. Finally, if a player cannot or does not want to play a card, one can be placed directly into the discard pile.

A round ends when the last story card is played onto the board. Points are then tallied. Each player gets a point for each story card that was played to the board in this round. A point is also awarded for each puzzle card that is still face up in front of the player. A bonus point is awarded if the player has all four puzzle cards face up. A point is subtracted from each player who is still holding a thief card in hand.

Further rounds are played, with the player with the least total points going first in each round, until at least one player has scored 21 or more points. The player with the most points wins.

10787,Murder,1981,0,0,1,3,6,45,45,,Card Game Deduction Murder/Mystery ,,"Murder is a somewhat unusual deduction game.  The equipment consists of a deck of (seemingly homemade but fairly sturdy) cards and a cloth bag.  The cards include a group of times, a number of opportunity cards (all identical), a group of motives (all with appropriate quotes, e.g. Love and murder will out. - William Congreve for the Love card), You Are Murdered cards, and 10 sets of actual murder cards, each set containing an alias, method, weapon, and place - for example, Archbishop, Ran Over, Car, and Avenue.

Each player gets a You Are Murdered card and a random assortment of others, and in turn takes a card and discards one into the bag.  The last player in the round takes the bag and can select one of the cards, discarding the rest face up (first player then rotates).

The object of this part is to collect a 4-card murder set plus a motive, opportunity, and time.  When you have these you discard You Are Murdered and the last player in the round becomes the victim when that card is pulled from the bag.

At that point the game shifts into deduction mode, with everyone trying to deduce which player was the murderer and what his or her alias, motive, and time cards are.

Unfortunately the rules go very vague at this point - questioning is totally free-form, there is no way to score (and the end doesn't come until everyone has the solution, apparently), and they don't address the issue of what happens if there is more than one murderer.  However, it may be possible to invent new rules to fix these problems.

The goal is to be the first player to move their crowned king onto the red home space opposite from where it started.

Each player starts with one uncrowned king and two pawns. On each turn a player moves one piece 5 spaces in order that the gravity selector shows.

The gravity selector contains ten black or white marbles in a clear column with a red base. At the beginning of a turn the player inverts the gravity selector and then returns it to its upright position. For example, the selector shows WBBWB. A piece must be moved first to a white circle. Next to a black circle and so on. A piece can be moved forward, backward or sideways.

Before a king can moved home, he must possess a red crown (small red marble). A king earns a crown when the player captures an opponents piece. Kings can be captured which results in the king losing its crown and returns to its start position.

10796,Ooyoo,2003,4,1,0,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Point to Point Movement,"From Bruno Faldetti's Review:

The name sounds like a Japanese war cry, and the game looks a bit like Go. With its large square box and its flat black box, Ooyoo could have been one of these strange games that we used to look with eagerness and curiosity in the Impens Radical bookshop, in Paris, in the late seventies and early eighties. Yes, I know I'm getting old. Nothing oriental though in this game, since the exotism is fake, and author and publisher both German.

Ooyoo, however, is what it looks like : a simple and subtle strategy game, with three lines of rules, that could well become a classic. Like in Halma or Chinese Checkers, each player starts in a corner of the board and tries to bring all his stones in the opposite corner. The trick is in the simple and original movement rule : stones can only move by pair, two adjacent stones moving one space in the same direction. This makes for various blocking and turning strategies, especially since each player has an uneven number of stones, and can't move backwards in his own half of the board.

Ooyoo is much more subtle than Chinese Checkers, but doesn't pretend to be as deep and as Go - the similarity is mostly in the overall look. This excellent strategy game deserves to become a modern classic, along with Twixt, Focus or Lines of Action, and can also make for a nice and slightly lighter change for Go or Chess players. Furthermore, it really looks like an exotic traditional game that you brought back from holidays, and will make a strong impression in your lounge.

10797,Hoorah!,1996,6.38,19,2.8,2,2,180,180,Wargames,American Civil War Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Subtitle: Six Bridges: The Battle of Pittsburgh, October 1, 1863

It was early September 1863  Gen. Robert E. Lee was perplexed. He'd smashed the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, then chewed up its remnants as it tried to defend Washington, captured that city, though much of it was burned in the process, and came within card throw of bagging both Lincoln  Grant. But instead of gaining the Confederacy the ultimate victory Lee had sought when he began that risky campaign, the fall of Washington served only to radicalize  galvanize the North.

Lincoln has sailed to Boston to set up a new US capital. He declined the 'offer of mediation toward peace' extended by the ambassadors of Great Britain  France. London  Paris soon recognized the Confederacy - the government of which now housed in the charred  bullet-pocked city of Washington, DD (that is, the District of Dixie!), and announced they would join the war to secure its independence.

But then, before Union  Anglo-French naval vessels even exchanged their first broadsides, the Prussians made their move, declaring for the Union  launching strong attacks into France  Bavaria. That led the Austrians; ever jealous and fearful their Prussian cousins were aiming to supplant their primacy in the Germanic world, to throw in with France. Then the Czar mobilized his millions of newly emancipated serfs, creating the largest single army yet seen on the planet, leading them in an attack on Vienna.

With the CSA, Britain, France  Austria on one side, fighting the USA, Prussia  Russia on the other, World War I began in August 1863. Home Before the Leaves Fall was the cry heard across the northern hemisphere.

Lee convinced Jefferson Davis to reinforce him by shifting troops fromBragg;'s Army to create a 4th Corps for the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised of Tennessee men  recruits from the new Confederate state of Maryland, Gen. Pat Cleburne was picked to run it. Lee intended to use the new Corps as a screen for his next offensive.

With the fall of Vicksburg,  Port Hudson, Lee reasoned Gen.Sherman would move east to relieve the Union's fortunes. If he could intercept Sherman  destroy his army before it linked with Grant's, the war would surely end. Scanning his maps, Lee determined Pittsburgh was the key. If he controlled it, he would sever the only east / west rail line left to the Union. It was also the perfect place to meet the British (actually Anglo-Canadian) Expeditionary Force forming in Canada for a crossing of Lake Erie.

Lee sent an outline of his plan to the Commander of the BEF, Sir Patrick Macdougall, who was highly receptive, sending a reply in which he promised to rendezvous with lee at Pittsburgh on or around October 1.

Until 14 September, Grant  Lincoln had assumed Lee's next move would be in the Northeast. On that day a minister of the Canadian government, a strong abolition man, defected with a copy of the Confederate general's letter. After much debate, the two US war leaders convinced themselves the document was authentic  set about to counter Lee's plan. The 3rd Corps was left to defend the Susquehanna River line, in case they were wrong, and a telegram was sent to Sherman instructing him to move to Pittsburgh as quickly as possible.

By the 17th, when Lee began marching northeast towards Pittsburgh, Grant had already stolen a day's march on him. The question became who would get to the city first to meet Lee  Grant: the BEF, shuttling across Lake Erie then marching down the western borderlands of Pennsylvania, or Sherman, coming up the Ohio valley. Neither Grant nor Lee knew who would be reinforced first or exactly when, but both understood there would be a savage fight for Pittsburgh. It would go into southern history books as the Battle of Six Bridges.

As noted, it is an alternative history of American Civil War, prequel of this is Wahoo! -- The Battle of Washington, July 8, 1863.

Between pervasive evil and countless temptations lurking beneath the city's glittery facade, Los Angeles proves to be the ideal address for a fallen vampire looking to save a few lost souls.

There are souls to be saved during daylight hours and in the dead of night. You have to choose which to save, you cannot win this battle by tryng to save both!

As the night approaches you will turn into your alter ego... a vampire. You will have special powers to see what others are not able to see in the day. Make the most of this time, for come the dawn, you will lose these powers, and have more mortal weaknesses.

By day or night there are souls to be saved and dangers to overcome. But in this game, if you can call it that, you not only have to look out for yourself. But also try to discover what other players are doing.

Only by doing this will you be able to manipulate the game towards its conclusion. For you to be the winner and the saviour of souls!

This game uses a license from the Angel TV series which ran from 1999 to 2004. The series was a spin-off of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.

The game mixes Roll and Move, hand management and memory mechanics. Each player has two hands of cards from distinct day and night decks but has limited opportunities to look at them. During the game, players manipulate their decks and decks of their opponents using different actions which are triggered either by landing on action squares or by action cards.

The first player to reach his starting point with three souls in one hand and none in the other wins.

A facedown track of tiles is laid out between the knights' castle and the dragons' lair. Each player controls three knights of different sizes. 
The active player rolls has two options: 
- roll all three dice (which correspond to the knights) and move the knights in any direction. If a knight lands on an armor tile, the player has to say what armor it is. If correct, the player can keep it, if not, the tile is returned.
- or look at an armor tile. 
If a knight lands on a dice tile, the player can re-roll the corresponding die. On plain tiles, nothing happens. When a knight lands on a tile with another player's knight of the same size, that knight is sent back to the castle.

A player who moves a knight into the dragons' lair flips over one of the dragon tiles there. The back side of the dragon tiles shows a piece of armor. If the player has such an armor tile, s/he defeats the dragon and wins the game. If not, the dragon is removed from the game and the knight returns to the castle to go and try again.

In this way players use their entrepreneurial skill to amass a personal fortune but must use business skill and strategy to avoid the consequences of bad dealing.

Instead, players try to predict the entire order of finish for all the cars in the race. All players can influence the speed of a car through their card play. Cards are played in tricks that are used to determine what car can move that round, how far it will move, who will drive the car, and finally what player will lead to the next trick. The track itself is far from any ordinary race track with various short cuts and back tracks scattered throughout the circuit allowing for drivers of the cars to have quite a bit of control over their progress. In the end, the player that most closely predicted the finishing order of each car will emerge victoriously.


A note about how to short cut a homemade version:
Use the cars from Knizia's Formula Motor Racing game and the cards from Sticheln. Using the cards from Sticheln is a real time and work saver! Granted, they won't have the cool race car look but it's a nice trade off if you have the game sitting around.

Animals turn out along the circular mountain trail, and a photographer needs to be ahead of the other if he wants to take a good picture: it is important to have a clear view, i.e. not blocked by anyone. Each subject is represented on a tile, and it is worth a certain amount of points, i.e. cameras, in this game. At the end of the round, the players exchange the decks so they will both have the same chance of playing, then new subjects are drawn, and a new round starts.

In Ascowt the action is set in the exciting world of racing... cows! The aim of the game is to cross the finish line first with your cattle, thus earning the most points possible: but will this be enough in order to win the game? Before the race starts, players lay secret bets on the final standings of the race: well-placed bets on other players' cows may give you the extra points you need to win... or will you dare betting everything on your own cattle, going for broke? At his turn, the player rolls the die: if he rolls a number between one and four, he moves the relevant cow forward one square. On a five, the player may move a cow of his choice, and on a six, the player may choose either to move a cow of his choice, or to milk one. A milked cow usually loses ground and possibly positions in the race... Some special squares on the course give this fast paced and unusual race an extra twist; the race ends when one of the cows crosses the finish line. Each player earns points according to his cow's final standing, plus extra points if he won any bet: whoever has the most points at the end will be nominated Dairy Farmer of the Year!

You start with two (or in some variations four) pieces and new pieces are added by moving your pieces adjacent to each other. However, there is a catch. Each piece has two lives and using a piece to bring another onto the board uses one of those lives. Therefore, the game has a unique two steps forward one step back feel. In your turn your move may cause your own pieces to be removed but you never capture your opponent's. However, you can leverage your opponent's pieces as you add yours and he does not expend a life doing so.

An alternate winning strategy is to cause your opponent to have no legal move and even if you do not accomplish this, a large part of the game consists of maximizing your own mobility at the expense of your opponent. As with many Kadon games, multiple variations are provided.

You try to defeat your opponents by taking the opponent king or 6 of the opponent pawns. The number on the stones tell you how many tiles it can move straight or in an L-Bow. The idea for this game is taken from Shogun, but its not entirely the same. Set the Moves Mastermind option when starting a game to show numbers on the board and you will know what number your stone will get next when you move it.

The rules state that the goal is to circle the ship spaces on the board until you get six deflector shields. Then you are supposed to go up the special corridor spaces that lead to the bridge. The first player to reach the bridge wins.

Unfortunately, I see no special corridor spaces that lead to the bridge, so this game is broken right from the outset.

_____________________________________

(NOT SHOUTING - USING CAPS TO MAKE THIS COMMENT EASIER TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE ONE ABOVE).

THE CORRIDOR IS THERE, BUT IS NOT OBVIOUS; IF I'D BEEN WRITING OR EDITING THE INSTRUCTIONS, I'D HAVE DESCRIBED THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

ON THE BOARD/MAP, THERE IS ONLY ONE SPACE WHICH IS NOT OFFSET WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BRIDGE (THE BRIDGE IS THE ENTIRE CENTER SECTION, AROUND WHICH THE SPACES GO). THIS ONE SPACE IS MARKED BLAST, AND IS BETWEEN CREW'S QUARTERS AND WEAPONRY ROOM.

SUPPOSE YOU ARE ON THE YELLOW IMPULSE POWER UNIT SPACE, AND SPIN A 4: 1) BLAST, 2) WEAPONRY ROOM, 3) BLAST, 4) TURN THE CORNER = LANDS YOU INSIDE THE CIRCLE: THE BRIDGE (WHERE YOU SEE ALL OF THE PICTURED CREW MEMBERS AND THE LETTERING THE STAR TREK MAKE-A-GAME BOOK).

THIS IS PROBABLY AN EXAMPLE OF LACK OF TESTING. THE PEOPLE WHO CAME UP WITH THIS LUCK-BASED RUDIMENTARY GAME, WERE SO FAMILIAR WITH ITS LAYOUT THAT THEY THOUGHT THE CORRIDOR WOULD BE OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE ELSE. IF THEY'D ONLY PRESENTED THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE, THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS CONFUSED AS THE REST OF US, PROMPTING IMPROVEMENT TO EITHER THE MARKINGS, THE INSTRUCTIONS, OR BOTH.

IT DOES APPEAR TO BE THAT, ONCE YOU LAND ON THE BRIDGE BY EXACT COUNT, THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ROLL OF A 1, REQUIRED TO REACH THE CREW.

ALL THE BEST!

In Boom Box you are challenged in balancing your Boom Box right and left audio channels. Boom Box can be played by 2 or more players at the same time: each player just needs the supplied deck of 27 cards (print and cut them); the faster the player gets rid of his cards, the better! The cards represent different notes in three different colours and different lengths. After each player has flipped over the first card from their decks (this card representing the Boom Box itself), they must play their cards to the left or right of the radio, respecting these two easy rules: if you want to place a card on the Boom Box left channel, this card does not have to have any characteristic in common - number of notes, colour, length - with the preceding one; on the other hand, if you want to place a card on the Boom Box right channel, it must have at least one thing in common with the previous one. It is easy, isn't it? But what if the goal is to have the same number of cards on the left and on the right? Things get interesting and slightly harder, but funnier as well! Challenge your friends in this fast competition, and you will see! As soon as cards are placed, players draw new ones from their decks: when a deck is emptied, the round is over and points are scored. After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.

The Artifact takes us in a fantasy world far away, where humans, magical and evil creatures can be easily found walking around, just as in any Tolkien-inspired game. Players take up the role of one of these heroes (a Human, a Dwarf, an Elf and a Hobbit, indeed) and must recover their weapon, which is proved to be the only mean to destroy a powerful Artifact that is trying to put under its control the whole world. The path to the Mountain of Fate, the place where the Artifact is giving out its will, is full of dangerous creatures such as Trolls, Orcs and the mighty Black Knight. During his turn, the player rolls two different colored six-sided dice, thus determining both his hero movement and which of the evil character will be moved by the player sitting to his right. You got it: players are trying both to win advantage for their heroes and to stop the other players' ones at the same time. And if it's not your lucky day, you may even change the outcome you have rolled, but are you ready to pay its price, giving your opponents a free move? The game gets even more interesting because each evil character has its own special ability, and the map represents different types of terrain: each hero has a favored type of terrain (e.g. woods for the Elf) where he can peacefully rest and plan his next moves. Last but not least, there is also the possibility of casting a powerful spell and then bend evil characters' wills to yours...

11018,Roundabout,2004,5.39474,19,1.75,2,4,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Dice RollingGrid MovementRoll / Spin and Move,"This abstract game consists of five concentric rings divided into sixteen sectors (bars).  Each player has a home sector that is four bars wide.  Ten directional playing pieces start in the center bars of the home sector facing outwards.  Each turn players roll two dice and use each dice roll to move a piece either in its facing direction or along its bar.  When a piece starts a turn outside of it home sector and then is moved within the sector it is removed from the game.  The first player to run out of pieces wins the game.

Additional complexity comes from blocking, capturing (freezing pieces while simultaneously preventing other opposing pieces from entering the bar in which the capture occurs), removing pieces from the board through `ringers' and special moves from rolling doubles.  Variant rules exist for more cutthroat games and games with more than two players.

Player intelligence, elan, and flexibility determine a game's outcome, with little reference to luck. Opportunities for conclusive action are many, but must be seized decisively and courageously. Winning or losing, REICH is a memorable and enjoyable experience for every player.

We can explore the details in history books and commemorate the decades or even centuries that have passed since the end of the war.

There is no such comfortable passage of time in the Arab Israeli conflict, which sometimes feels like one long campaign, with pauses. We see as much in the newspaper as we do in history books.

So it is that ATO #46 is announced at a time when both Israelis and Syrians are at war, but not so much with each other.

No Middle Ground, by Paul Rohrbaugh, covers the most decisive actions on the northern front of the 1973 Arab-Israeli Conflict.

There are three scenarios, from the opening Syrian attack to retake Golan, to the daring Israeli counter-offensive that drove into the heart of Syria and took the war to the doorsteps of Damascus. Plus a Grand Campaign game that covers the entire campaign for the Golan.

Each copy of No Middle Ground includes a 22 by 34 map and a full sheet of colorful die-cut counters that represent brigades from the Syrian and Arab Allies armed forces and the battalions of the Israeli Defense Force. Air units on both sides are potent weapons but must dodge the enemys AAA and SAMs. Map hexes are 4 kilometers across and each turn represents 8 hours. Plus a well illustrated rulebook and charts, complete with designers notes and historical commentary.

Rules for No Middle Ground include, among others, Time-on-Target artillery barrages, Combined-Arms tactics, Improved Positions, Minefields, Airborne and Commando assaults, as well as optional units that could have been deployed by both sides. The interactive, chit-pull formation activation recreates the chaos of battle while still allowing players to deploy and fight their armies.

No Middle Ground will test the resolve and skills of game novices and veterans alike. Although designed for two players, solitaire play is quite easy.

No Middle Ground and issue #46 of ATO:

Map - One full color 22x34 mapsheet

Counters - Over 200 full color 9/16 die-cut pieces

Rules length - 12 pages

Charts and tables - 2 pages

Complexity - Medium

Solitaire suitability - Average

At the start of the game each player selects a color and the Fates Cards are distributed evenly between the players. On a players turn they roll the dice and move that many spaces forwards. On the roll of an even number, movement must be straight ahead. If an an odd number is rolled, the player can change lanes. The game ends once a player has completed 7 laps of the track.

The innovation that stops this from becoming a roll and move game are the Fates Cards and the Chance Cards. The board spaces are marked with either a C Chance symbol, an F Fates symbol, or a Fatum symbol. If your piece ends its turn in one of the spaces, then you follow the directions. If you land on a Fatum symbol and have the corresponding Fates card then you follow the directions on the Fates card either good or bad. If you land on an F symbol then you can swap a Fates card with the player on your left. If you land on a C symbol then you take a Chance card and the instructions are followed by the player indicated on the card.

This game is not to be taken too seriously and has a large element of luck.
The most unique thing about this game is that it is a Tunisian production released for the 28th century anniversary since the founding of Carthage, and as such was produced for the tourist market.

11058,Munchkin Blender,2004,5.95088,784,1.8462,3,6,90,90,,Card Game Expansion for Base-game Fighting Humor ,Dice RollingTradingVariable Player Powers,"				
					Overview

Munchkin Blender expands every card game in the Munchkin family. It's intended for games with multiple base and expansion sets (now known as blender games).

				
					Publisher's Description

Stir Things Up!

It's the ultimate party kit for Munchkin fans! Munchkin players really like to combine their sets... Munchkin, Star Munchkin, Munchkin Fu, all in one game. That gets really weird... but it can also slow the game down.

There are a lot of ways we COULD have addressed this problem. But this is Munchkin, so the solution we chose was to create a lot of really overpowered new cards. Why be a Super-Munchkin when you can be an Ultra-Munchkin? If a Half-Breed isn't enough, you can be a 1/3-Breed. And if a single Cheat card doesn't do it for you, you can Cheat With Both Hands!

There are also a lot more monster enhancers... and ITEM enhancers, too. There are several new low-level monsters to help you get those easy kills. Unless somebody takes that Sock Puppet and turns it into the Ultra-Rare Extremely Sneaky Sock Puppet With Extra Cheese . . .

Munchkin till you drop! Munchkin Blender -- just add players!

This is an expansion, not a stand-alone game. It is meant to be combined with at least one Munchkin game, and preferably two or more, with or without other supplements.

				
					Other

This set was updated as part of The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover but was never reprinted. Many of the updated cards are available, however, via Munchkin: Go Up a Level.

Part of the Munchkin series.

This set is permanently out of print and has been superseded by Munchkin 7: Cheat With Both Hands, which has all the same cards but with the fantasy Munchkin color scheme.

A gameboard like no other  the grid is a swirl of arches, a network of intersections. Three intriguing games of positional and movement strategy employ a unique element:  a piece flips on every move from slider to jumper and back again. In Endpoint your goal is to exit all 15 of your pieces from the board through the opponent's home row. In End Jam you win if all the opponent's endpoints are occupied. In End Rush each player seeks to capture the board's center space. Some solitaire puzzles are also included. Cylindrical wood playing pieces have felt on one side to indicate their status. The 24 gameboard is offered in two formats, recommended for Ages 10 and up.

An entertaining game for children which plays very similar to Carcassonne. Place a tile wherever it matches and claim the points.
I introduced the variant of providing each player with a counter, so they can claim one bug as their own to be finished later, like in Carcassonne. That way, players are not exposed to be stolen their bugs and encouraged to build longer bugs.

It turns to be quite fun due to the pictures and also when any child by mistake place two heads or two tails together....  X-Mutant bugs!!

11109,Meeting of the Minds,1997,6,1,0,2,25,1,1,,Educational ,Co-operative PlayRole PlayingSimulation,"Meeting of the Minds is an educational board game specifically designed to teach students important knowledge and skills in conflict resolution.  In the game, students answer questions about conflict resolution and must use a win-win strategy to resolve conflicts.  It is designed for students in grades 5 - 8.

Players earn points in two ways.  They can earn points by answering questions correctly.  These questions come up when the players pick Conflict Resolution and True-Flase cards.  The game creates conflicts among the players and they can also win points by successfully resolving these conflicts.  As a result, the players are involved in two learning processes simultaneously - (1) learning the knowledge and skills for successful conflict resolution and (2) applying the knowledge and skills while playing the game.  Players are therefore cooperating in finding solutions and competing at the same time.  This dynamic relationship leads to a very exciting game.

Players have a selection of square tiles divided into three types: Chi, Remedy and Sha tiles. The basic tiles are the Chi tiles, which are used to develop the flow of Chi across the board. They come in eight types: ten each of connecting tiles which take the chi energy from one edge of the square to one two or three other edges. There are a further eight Chi ending tiles, two each of four deigns which are needed to terminate unneeded Chi paths. There are also eight Sha tiles, two each corresponding to the the four Chi tiles. This can be placed upon the corresponding opponents tile and thereby blocking the flow. However, a player can overcome these blocks by using the Remedy cards, again two each corresponding to the four Chi tiles.

Each player draws a hand of four tiles (called a reserve) and each turn they can place one tile on the 8 x 8 board. (This is decorated with a Maltese Cross, which it appears only has a psychological effect, as there is no reference to it in the rules.) Starting at the entrance to their respective palace, each player seeks to develop a flow of chi to the other side of the board. As they play a tile, each player can replenish their reserve from their stock. If they are unhappy with their reserve they can replace up to the entire four tiles of the reserve, which then constitutes the entirety of their turn.

Players roll a die then are asked a question. Each card has 6 questions on it, one for each grade level. A player may only select a question from a grade equal to the grade he/she has started or higher. If the correct answer is given, the player moves ahead a number of spaces equal to the die roll plus the difference between the lowest grade he/she could have selected and the grade level actually selected.

The board has a few design differences from a simple straight path but is essentially a move from A to B setup.

The winner is the player to make it to the end first.

Additional Rules for older players:
If you are in Junior high, you must answer grade 6 questions and subtract 1 from your die roll.
If you are above Junior high, you must answer grade 6 questions and subtract 2 from your die roll.
You do not move backwards if the result is less than 0.

Early in 1862, a little known General named U.S. Grant overran West Tennessee, taking two river forts and the largest bag of prisoners captured up to that time by an American army.  But as the Union troops advanced on Corinth, the Confederates hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.
GRANT MOVES SOUTH puts you in command of the Tennessee campaign.  As General Grant, you must combine river and overland movement to strike deep into rebel territory against the important points of Nashville, Corinth, Memphis, and Columbus.  As the Confederate General, A.S. Johnston, you must use careful maneuver and counterattacks to prevent the ever-growing torrent of Bluecoats from conquering Tennessee.

GRANT MOVES SOUTH shows the critical importance of the road net, water movement and the abilities of individual division commanders.  The fog of war is thick as you know where the enemy is, but not how strong he is.  Gunboats attack river forts, and steamers whisk troops deep into enemy territory.

Units are battalions, with companies and regiments. Most games in the series have players commanding anywhere from a division to a corps worth of forces, and employment of combined arms tactics becomes critical. The system shows the evolution of tactical doctrine in both the Japanese and Allied armies with Banzai charges, superior U.S. fire coordination, naval bombardment, airpower, amphibious landings, and engineer operations. Games in this volume include:

The Fall of Singapore is a simulation of one of the worst military defeats in British history. From December of 1941 to February of 1942, the campaign is a case study of a smaller but better-lead force of Japanese outmaneuvering a much larger but poorly trained and ill-led British.

Struggle on Bataan recreates the desperate U.S. and Filipino defense of the Bataan Peninsula between 9 January and 9 April 1942.  The defense of Bataan, though ultimately doomed, constituted the only serious disruption to the string of Japanese victories during the first six months of the war.

Turning Point: Guadalcanal is the struggle between the United States and Japan for possession of the island of Guadalcanal in the southern Solomons chain. The battle lasted from August 1942 until early February 1943.  The opponents on Guadalcanal were approximately of equal strength and with control of the seas around the island still to be decided, Guadalcanal was the last time in the war when an American amphibious operation faced the prospect of total defeat.

11211,Stealth: The Game,1996,5.8875,16,2,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Bluffing Science Fiction ,Secret Unit Deployment,"From game summary on box:

A brilliant dimension lies before you and a cunning battle must be fought. Your powerful Stealth Force has been protecting its portion of Dimension Gemstone for centuries, but the enemy has been looming ever closer; threatening to conquer your territory.

Strategy - You may find that your only protection is your wide array of Stealth Attack Modules and their Concealed Power Pieces as you move through Dimension Gemstone, evading your dangerous opponent. Some of your Power Pieces can be used to destroy, while others can distract and act as decoys. The Starburst, Blaster, Ringer, Decoy and Laser each have special ways of fending off the enemy (see below). As commander of the Stealth Force, you must remember the importance of your mission - defend, retaliate and move with all possible speed. The future of Dimension Gemstone is in your hands.

Under Fire - The longer you wait to retaliate, the more time your opponent has to build strategy and plan the next attack. Keep focused as there are concealed dangers that may catch you unaware.

Escape - Dimension Gemstone has Portals that are the way for you and your Stealth Force to find a route of escape, or as a means of Surprise attack. They can zip you from one side of Dimension Gemstone to another, swiftly out of danger's way.

Your Mission is Clear - and it is of the utmost importance that you keep in mind the dynamics of each Stealth Attack Module. Your victory or defeat may be at stake. As Commander of the Stealth Force, you control the fate of Dimension Gemstone.

Each move is an exciting and strategic challenge to outmaneuver your opponent. Dimension Gemstone needs your protection. Seek to conquer, but be careful not to fall into the hands of the enemy. 
 Each type of power piece is different. While a BLASTER can destroy all pieces and Portals in a 2-space range, the RINGER has only a 1-space range. The LASER has a 7-space range limit and can destroy the first piece or Portal in a straight line. The STARBURSTS have the power to emanate energy in a starburst pattern and can destroy all pieces and Portals within a 3-space, straight line.

There is only one die to roll, so you cannot get in or out of Jail with doubles; instead, rolling a 6 or paying $100 gets you out. Only two houses are needed before a hotel can be built, and the interest rate is fixed at $40.

The winner of the game gets not only the satisfaction of having won over his or her opponents, but also has the privilege of consuming all the chocolate.

The roll-up board has to be set up to play: stretch the canvas board over the provided sticks and legs, and it makes a little table that not only stands up well on the beach, it actually requires sand to stand up well as it's a little wobbly on its own...  The pieces are all wooden, and there are no cards to lose or get wet - it really does play well at the beach.  (You can just lay the canvas board flat on your gaming table if not at the beach.)

Each player has four baby turtles, just hatched, which must get to the sea.  These start on your edge of the board, on little cracked-egg spaces.  First player to get all four turtles off the board wins.  (The sea is represented by a space at the center of the board, a little disconcerting ...)  Each turn you roll one die and move any one turtle the number showing, with no backtracking.

Other wooden pieces on the board are dunes.  You cannot cross a dune: you have to land on one exactly.  In so doing, you remove it from the board and must place it on some other space.  Your best option, of course, is somewhere that blocks your opponent ...

Landing on an opponent's turtle sends it back to a start space.

Two of the dune pieces have crabs on the back, which can be used in an optional rule.  (Crabs are the enemies of newly hatched baby turtles ...)

11233,Hampshire,2004,0,0,0,2,2,15,15,,Dice Word Game ,Dice Rolling,"Hampshire is a word game made in Littleton, New Hampshire (USA) - hence the name.  The game comes with four dice (red, blue, green, purple), two player letter charts (in color), rules, and a pad of score sheets (which contain simply 25 blank squares in a 5x5 grid).  The whole thing fits in a box 3 x 3 x 2 (7.5 cm x 7.5 cm x 5 cm) and so is touted as being for home or travel.

Each turn you roll all four dice and consult the letter chart.  The chart shows a result from 1-5 for each of the four colors.  The twenty spaces contain the twenty consonants (all except Y).  So a roll of 4 on the blue die gives a T result, for example.

If the player rolls no 6s, he must choose one of the consonants rolled and enter it anywhere he wants in the 5x5 score sheet.  If he rolled at least one 6, he may also enter a vowel (or Y) of his choice.  If the red and green dice = 7, he may use the purple and blue dice as normal (choose one consonant from the blue and purple rows) but may then add a second consonant of his choice.

The letter(s) chosen must be entered onto the score sheet - there is only one score sheet for both players, passed back and forth each turn.  Basic Scrabble rules are followed in the mini 5x5 board.  Every letter placed must be alone or make a word.  You score one point for each word you make.  First player to nine points wins.  When the score sheet is full or unusable, if no one has reached nine points, start a new score sheet.

This in itself is a little spooky, but what's really spooky is that the box says that Aztral Games designed it for Astra Fireworks Company in the UK!

It's a fairly simple game: move one space on your turn and possibly draw a card.  The object is to be the first to get your four barrels of gunpowder at the edges of the board to Parliament at the center of the board - you can only carry one at a time.  The board has lots of squares, some with text on them and some with tunnels for faster (but riskier) movement.

About a fifth of the spaces are of each player color, and the other fifth are white.  If you end your turn on a white space or your own color, your turn is over.  If you end on another color, draw a card.  These range from being good for you (Take another turn) to potentially bad for you or even for an opponent (Counterinsurgency agents raid ...).

Sometimes games end with Parliament being blown up, but more often one player simply has the last uncaptured piece on the board.  This is actually kind of reassuring, in a real-world sense.

There are 12 companies divided into Industrials (such as GM), Railroads (such as Union Pacific), and Utilities (such as ATT).  There are four of each type, and each type has a peg board of a different primary color.

On your turn you may take one and only one action.  An action is either buying or selling stock in one company.  (You don't have to sell all when you sell.)

When you buy stock in a company, you move its individual peg up one, two or three spaces depending on how many shares you buy.  Likewise when you sell: you move the stock price down one, two, or three spaces.

After each action, draw a card and see what happens.  Many of the cards refer to the stock just transacted: a split, or all players holding the stock collect a dividend, or are assessed a fine, or the company goes bankrupt, etc.  (Yes, it's as fierce as the dot.coms a few years ago: five of the twelve companies will be bankrupt by the game's end!)

Other cards are general and refer to the whole board.  Sometimes you roll dice which affect all industrials or railroads or utilities.  In that case, you slide the whole peg board for that particular color up or down as necessary.  There are dice in three colors with sides of +2, +4, +6, -2, -4, -6 on them.

11255,Battle Royale,2000,6,1,0,2,2,0,0,,Card Game Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Variable Player Powers,"Battle Royale Card Game - based on the hit Japanese film of the same name by Kinji Fukasaku.

The card game was a limited release promotional item given out at select cinemas in Japan during the film's grand opening.

Basic story of the film:
Japan is in a state of civil unrest. In an attempt to dissuade Japanese youth from criminal acts, the government enacts the Battle Royale Act. A class of students is randomly selected to partake in the Battle Royale Survival Program. Students are given a bag of supplies with a weapon and sent out on an island with a remote detonated bomb around their neck. The game begins. Only one student will survive. It's kill or be killed. If there are no deaths in a 60 minute window, a bomb collar is randomly detonated. Areas of the island are randomly designated dangerous and all collars within that area detonate. In 3 days a single winner will emerge victorious.

This is a game based on that premise. It comes with 12 student cards, 20 battle cards, 9 location cards, 3 dangerous area cards, 16 event cards and 1 paper game mat.

11259,Undersea Adventure,1967,6,6,2,2,6,0,0,,Nautical ,Dice RollingPick-up and DeliverPoint to Point MovementSet Collection,"The deep sea is full of secrets and rich in shapes and colors.  This game will give a glimpse of the adventurous world underwater - Hans Hass.  Hass was a scuba-diving pioneer, and with his beautiful wife Lotte was well-known in the 1950s for his underwater photography and film-making.

Each player is a diver competing to bring to the surface the greatest number and value of sea creatures (and some treasure!).  The deeper the dive, the greater the rewards, but also the greater the risk of losing the catch from unwelcome events or robbery by another player.  Returning to their ship makes the diver's catch safe, but takes time, and the next dive may be limited to shallower waters where there is less to find.

The catch is represented by cards of differing values, with bonuses if sets are collected, including some dangerous creatures scoring negative points.  Most show an interesting underwater photo.  There are also Action (event) cards and Diving Equipment cards, that determine how deep each dive can go.

The board has a disc underneath, and when this is rotated different colors show through holes punched in the top board.  Each turn the player takes the action determined by the color at the current location of their diver pawn - take a number of value cards, an event card or a dangerous card - and then hopes to move somewhere else to collect more value cards.  The disc is rotated each time cards are taken, and the holes are far enough apart that the change of color is unpredictable.  There is a die, but its main use is to determine the outcome of robberies.

11260,Naval Wargame Rules for the Ironclad Era,1991,5.5,2,0,2,2,60,60,Wargames,American Civil War Miniatures Nautical Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"The object of these rules is to reproduce the tactics of naval warfare in the period 1860 to 1880. This was the time when naval architecture and warfare underwent fundamental changes. No longer the majestic lines of the wooden walls, now the three-decker with smoke belching from funnels looking out of place between the masks, the awkward shapes of the American Civil War vessels and finally the multitude of one off designs which prevailed until the start of the Pre-Dreadnought era. Tactics were dictated by the great variety of vessels and weapons available, (an homogeneous fleet being unknown) and sometimes by the restricted sea-space available. I have tried to reflect these problems and changes in this set of rules.

In order to play the game, players will require the following equipment:
Metric rule    
Angle indicator    
Cotton wool.
Turning circle (see Appendix)    
Protractor    
Damage Control Chart for each vessel
A pair of decimal dice When used as a pair 00 shall represent 100. when used individually zero shall represent 10. Models with removable masts for sailing vessels. Details of armor, armament, speed, dimensions (free board, length, breadth and draught), whether single or twin screwed for each vessel being used. Position of the vessels engines should be known as they are not always below water - if unknown assume them to be below water.

11261,Hammerin' Iron,1992,5.66667,6,0,2,2,30,30,Wargames,American Civil War Nautical Wargame ,Dice RollingHex-and-Counter,"This set of rules are intended to cover the engagements that took place between 1861 and 1865 during the American Civil War. The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.

As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of punching. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.

To play this game there is an amount of equipment to be assembled.
1. Ships to 1/600th scale.
2. Enough 15mm scale figures and guns to represent the gun deck of the ship.
3. A piece of card or model to 13mm scale upon which to put the figures, thus showing the exact position.
4. Hexagons inscribed in 5.5 circles for movement purposes. (2 for each ship)
6. Some ordinary 1-6 sided dice.
7. Some scenery for sandbars and shore batteries.
8. Paper to note down damage.
9. A blue cloth or similar.
10. Some friends with whom to play.

11285,Beachcomber,1984,6,2,0,2,6,60,60,,Card Game Nautical ,Card DraftingHand Management,"From the rules:

INTRODUCTION: BEACHCOMBER was created by two world sailors. After rounding Cape Hatteras in a 60' schooner, they found refuge from the storm in Silver Lake Harbor on Orcacoke Island. During their stay on Ocracoke they found the Outer Banks life-style so unique that they were inspired to capture that feeling, and the game of Beachcomber came to life.

BASIC SUMMARY: This is a card game in the vein of Mille Bornes. One's goal is to collect the most shells (similar to mileage cards). The quantity of shells one can pick up is based on the mode of transportation (food, bike, 4x4), and there are various problems that can slow you down (soft sand, no reservation, hot sand). You must be on vacation to collect shells (similar to the Go card), and there are things that can frustrate the vacation (hotel bill, food bill, beach gear bill, and gas bill); bills can be addressed with money or super solutions.

11286,Paradox,2001,5.86895,19,2.5,2,4,0,0,,Card Game ,Auction/BiddingTrick-taking,"Paradox is a deck of 44 cards in four suits of face value 0 to 10. There are three games that can be played: Costly Tricks for 2 players, Buddy On Your Left for three players and The Third Man for four players.

From the publisher:

Costly Tricks: a trick-taking game for 2 players in which you must pay for your tricks!
The players see the entire deck after it has been dealt out to themselves and their invisible partners. They take turns playing cards for themselves and their partners with trump shifting when they cannot follow suit. Cards are worth their face value (0 to 10), but tricks cost 20 points! Thus they want to take the valuable tricks and make their opponent take the costly tricks.

Buddy on your Left: a game for 3 players where each player's score is his own plus that of his left hand neighbor!
A card is led then players in turn play cards either higher or lower than the lead card. As long as the played cards are lower, the pile continues to grow. As soon as a card higher in value than the initial card is played, that player sweeps the entire pile. Cards from 1 to 6 score their value, 7 to 10 are worth nothing. After the last card is played, you score for the cards you collected plus the cards your left hand opponent collected. Highest score wins.

The Third Man: an outrageous bidding game for 4 players
The game consists of a series of auctions, for each of which the house puts up a prize fund of 10 points. Highest bidder gets the 10 points, less the number he had bid (ex. if he bid 9, he earns 1). The second highest bidder loses the full amount he had bid (ex. if he bid 7 he loses 7). Whereas the third highest bidder receives from the house double the number he had bid (if he bid 5, he pockets 10!). Therefore in each auction your objective is to be third--and in any case not second

The goals of the two included games are straightforward enough -- connect opposite sides of the board, or control the four center squares.  However, the pieces are something of a mystery.  Most will be blank side up at first, and it is only as they are overturned that you discover whether each moves one square at a time or an unlimited number (like a queen in Chess.)  In addition, there are certain special moves that can dramatically alter gameplay.

The Battle of the Piave, also called the Battle of the Solstice in Italy, was a part of the last desperate offensive of the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire to bring about a decision in its war with Italy. After its failure the disintegration of the Habsburg forces accelerated. This situation presented the Italian leadership with the opportunity to score a glorious military victory in the last days of the war in order to enhance the Italian stature at the peace conference to follow in Paris. The resulting battle is called Vittorio Veneto, like Waterloo, sharing its name with a town north of the actual battlefield.

The 11 x 17 map represents the Italian battlefield using large hexes with contact boxes between. The 280 counters represent the combat forces involved in the struggle.

Game play

As a player draws and plays a card, he or she tells a story about the card, using the scene depicted as an inspiration.  As more cards are drawn, the players build up a grand tale, using their descriptions of the scenes played as components.  Players can chose not to pass or not to play the cards they have drawn.  As the activity is purely cooperative, no one can interrupt or contradict each other's contribution to the tale that is being spun.

A joker card lets the current player decide who has to go next. The active player has to put one of his/her chips on the card, turn over the next card and place the card on the chip. If he/she successfully completes the turn, he/she gets the Theo, the zookeeper pawn. When the stack of cards and pawns collapses, the player who currently has the Theo pawn (i.e. the last player to have added a chip and card without collapsing the stack) gets a fish card.

These are real companies, with real ratings and real data from the year listed. You must pick one the companies and follow your investment through the year, stopping each quarter to assess whether you want to sell your stock, or hold to the next quarter.

11316,Battle Chips,2001,6,1,0,2,2,5,5,,Action / Dexterity Fantasy Fighting ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"A unique game, Battle Chips contains 30 wooden chips divided into two armies (orcs versus barbarians).  Each army has (in descending order of strength) one leader, one wizard, three bowmen, four pikemen, and four warriors.  They also have two shield-bearers.  On the back of each chit is simply an orc face or a human face, which, if used in combat, is lower than a warrior.

On a given turn, each player secretly selects three units, keeping the remaining units face down in front of him.   The players take turns dropping them onto a cloth surface (tablecloth or towel on a table) from about a foot above the table (30 cm).  Whichever side they land face up is their strength for the current round.

Certain faces have different abilities, however:

     a human or orc face allows you to call for reinforcements (one additional chip from your unused chips) for each face showing),
     a shield bearer allows you to protect one unit in the upcoming combat
     a wizard may force a re-drop of all pieces except itself
     a leader allows you re-drop any one chip (morale).




After all special abilities are used, line up your troops from strongest to weakest, and compare with your opponents.   The two strongest fight each other, with the loser removed from the game (remove both in case of ties).  Then the next two strongest fight, etc.  Shield bearers can be assigned to any chips.  A shielded chip attacks but may not be killed - remove the shield from the game, instead.

When one side loses its leader, the game is over and the other side is victorious.

While it sounds simple, your choices are actually not always easy.  If you risk your leader and it lands the wrong side up, it's the weakest piece on the board.  You can call for reinforcements, but units used in earlier combats cannot be called until all combats with the units that started that round have been completed.

For those who dislike the mechanic of dropping chips, you could use a die roll, coin flip, or card cut for each piece to determine its facing.

In your turn you must move to an adjacent segment and you can then take the track allowed by the new segment that you are in. Furthermore, next turn, you cannot move back into the segment you were in at the start of your last turn (In other words, you cannot go to and from between the same two segments). However, it is possible to impede an opponent because no two players may be in the same segment. As up to six can play, this board can get pretty crowded. In each segment (except for two special symbols) there are images that relate to the piece of track you receive. This track is laid on the tabletop area, there is no board on which they are to be placed. Therefore, your direction and length of track is only limited by the size of your table!

Track received must be added to one of your lines immediately. The objective is to build three independent lines that end up with a black tile (a station). When one player has achieved this, the game ends and you score a point for every track tile on your network. The most points, wins (note that this might not be the player that ended the game).

Zulu! covers the famous defense of Rorkes Drift by 'B' Company, 2nd Battalion, 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot.

The game has no hexes, no squares, no point-to-point.  It also has counters with no ratings.  In some ways, its like cardboard miniatures  with fewer rules. The game system highlights the firepower of the British Martini Henry rifle, the value of a solid defensive position, and the greatly superior numbers of the three Zulu amabutho that gave them something like forty-to-one numerical superiority.

Even so, each British counter represents one man, and we have identified each with his name and unit. Zulu combat counters represent about 25-30 men, but that usage is not literal, given the unusual system. The map scale is 1 = 4 yards. The mechanics cover such facets of the engagement as Zulu fire from the Oskarberg terraces, the Hospital and its patients, the pros and cons of setting fire to that building, even possible heroics by the very men who earned Victoria Crosses for their actions during the battle.

The game also includes scenarios on  Isandlwana  Kambula.

11332,Helpline,2002,5.8,5,3,3,6,15,15,,Humor Party Game Real-time Word Game ,Dice RollingPick-up and DeliverSet Collection,"I have seen this game in 3 themes:
Over The Hill
Menopause Madness
Mid-Life Crisis.

Each game comes with:
50 Problem cards
200 Solution cards
1 Counselor die
1 One minute timer.

Game play:
One person is the Caller.

The Caller picks up a Problem card and reads it.

The Caller then rolls the die, which determines who the call is made to, i.e. a friend, psychic, shrink, etc.

The Caller then turns over the timer.

The other players (called Counselors) then have one minute to sort through the various solution cards.  The solution cards each have one word on them.  They take the cards and construct a reply in the theme rolled on the Counselor die.  This is all done simultaneously by all of the Counselors.

The Caller acts as the time keeper and gives the Counselors a running record of the appox. time remaining.

When the time is up, each Counselor reads his reply.  The Caller names the one he likes best and the Counselor get to keep the Problem card.

The Caller position then rotates to the left and that player is the Caller for the next round.

For a 3-4 player game you play until one player has 5 Problem cards.

For a 5-6 player game you play until 3 cards are won.

11333,Into the Dragon's Cave,1993,0,0,0,2,5,30,30,,Adventure Card Game Fantasy Horror Science Fiction Space Exploration ,Storytelling,"A series of six different games, all with the same gameplay:

Into the Dragon's Cave (fantasy);
Into the Deserted Chapel (horror);
Into the Domain of Capella (science fiction);
Into the Dark Continent (Victorian adventure);
Into the Dear Caress (romance);
Into the Dream Centre (surrealism).

Each of them come in a ziplock bag with A4 sheets of cardstock.  You have to cut out the 200 cards to create the game.  The rules take up half a single sheet of the cardstock.

Before beginning, shuffle the cards and then choose the size of the deck used in the game.  All 200 cards would make for a very long game and is not recommended except for masochists.  The shortest variant is simply to use the initial six cards dealt you and no more.  They also give estimated playing times for 50 and 100 cards.

Game play is reminiscent of Once Upon a Time.  There are no Happy Ever After cards, however: you choose a card from your initial hand to be your ending card.  The cards have phrases or single words on them, largely relevant to the individual genre.  On your turn, you play a single card, weave it into the story, and then draw a card from the draw pile.  Play then passes to the next player, who does the same.  Players may boo and heckle your input, in which case you have to do it over.  This game is definitely concerned more with the quality of story than competition.

In fact, victory conditions are very understated.  Once the draw deck is finished and you've played your last card, on your turn you may then play your ending card, provided you can work it into the story sufficiently well (without getting disdain from your fellow players).  You then win the game, but the game (story) doesn't end until everyone has finished with their cards, also!

Clearly not for competitive players, these games are more a pastime than a game.

The designers also list options for mixing the decks: romance in space or fantasy horror, for example.

Each child simultaneously places one of their 8 potion ingredient tiles on the board. Decide whether to play a snake, bone, toadstool, or the unwanted spider tiles. Then the electronic Magor the Magician figurine (2 AAA batteries) is moved around his potions pot. He makes his little magical tune and his conical wizard hat lights up and flickers. If his hat stays lit after his piping and peeping sound is done, he is suspicious and wants to check everyone's ingredients. If you tried to sneak a spider into his potion, you are caught and most remove the tile. If his hat doesn't stay lit, Magor trusts you and doesn't check your ingredient and it stays on the board.

First player to lay all eight ingredients, including the unwanted spiders, wins. Ties are possible.

The United Nations' counterattack began on September 15th when the United States' XCorps landed at Inchon. By late November, the Communist forces were pushed north almost all the way to China. The American forces were promised they would be home for Christmas. On November 27th, 100,000 Chinese infantry launched an offensive against 28,500 American Marines and Army troops in the sub-zero cold northwest of the Koto-Ri Plateau.

In 10 days, half the Americans were dead, wounded, or frost-bitten  37,500 Chinese soldiers shared similar fates  and a new name for valor under impossible conditions had been carved in the Annals of Warfare: CHOSIN.

In July, 1941, Finnish troops began a thrust through the wilderness just south of the Arctic Circle, hoping to reach the important rail junction of Louhki, a vital link on the Soviet Union's lifeline, the Murmansk Railway.  Despite the assistance of Adolf Hitler's vaunted SS troops, they were turned back by the Soviet Forces, who later launched a counterattack of their own.  The village of Kestenga became the center of several fiercely fought battles as the world's largest nation and one of its smallest struggled for their existence.

The second Axis thrust to cut the Murmansk Railroad crossed the pre-war border near Kestenga in the Summer of 1942. The Soviets were caught unprepared for the German-Finnish assault and had to hold out until reinforcements came up. The Germans met guards tank units for the first time in the Finnish campaign.

Starting off with 5 cards in their hands, they take turns to resolve the election.  During his or her turn, a player either plays a card or discards one.  Playing Vote cards gives a player a stake in controlling one of the nine countries in the game.  If a player collects all four cards of a country, his or her party gains total control of the country.

Certain Scandal and Authority cards can be played to let players take away votes or even countries from the others.  Other Scandal and Authority cards offer defense from such attacks.

When a player controls a majority of the nations, he or she wins the game.  Players can also pair up to form a coalition and gain the majority needed to win, making it a shared victory between the two.

Unfortunately, that means you have to do all the bookkeeping on paper that the computer could do easily.  Most players will find it a bit tedious to constantly have to calculate and record population, crops, seed, food, weapons, etc.  However, we sometimes play it at a restaurant while waiting for the food to come - it's not a bad way to pass the time, really, when you don't have less portable games around.

The game consists of a rules/events booklet, three six-sided dice, and a pad of record sheets.  The game is set in a mythical Renaissance-era kingdom, with each player playing a separate village in that kingdom.  You can trade goods with each other each turn, but can only attack others when you roll a 1 for an event table.

To play, each player takes a record sheet (you may need more than one per person, depending on how long the game lasts) and a pencil.  Determine first player, and write down your starting village: 5 each of people, gold, land, food, and seed.  The seed can go into either the ground as crops or storage - you should have some of each for safety.

On a player's turn, she rolls the three dice.  The red die tells you which table to look under: Attacks, Catastrophes, Good Times, Mixed Events, All Players Involved, or More Mixed Events.  The green (or yellow in some sets) die is then the tens digit, and the white die the ones digit.  So a roll of 5, 4, 1 means you look at event #41 on table 5.  (That's a bad one, a plague, but it's bad for everybody ...)

Once a player has resolved an event, ALL players Harvest crops, make weapons, get people, eat food, barter with other players or the King, store food and seed, plant seed - record this on your sheet with a pencil.  You assign your people to weapon making or harvesting - they can't do both in the same turn.  Then the next player takes their turn at the event table, after which ALL players repeat the harvest, weapons, food, seed, etc.  This is the part that drives some people crazy - there's a LOT of record keeping.

The game ends when one player reaches either 20 land units, 200 gold, or reaches a population of 35 people.  If you do one of these, you win.

The components include a small roll-up vinyl board with 16 circular spaces forming a 4x4 grid; eight yellow plastic discs and eight green plastic discs, and the box and rules.  Half of each color of the discs have a single arrow on them, and half have a double arrow.

Avoid -- The object is to play the last piece. Played pieces point orthogonally or diagonally to another space. Single arrows point to spaces one spaces away and double arrows point to spaces two spaces away. After the first piece is played subsequent plays must be to a space which does not have a piece on the board pointing to it.

Null-and-Void -- Start by filling your half of the board with your pieces, alternating single and double arrows so that each type is diagonally adjacent to like pieces and orthogonally adjacent to the opposite type.  Remove one of your opponent's pieces from the game, and she does the same to you.  Take turns moving a piece into an adjacent void, pointing the arrow at an opponent's piece.  Double arrows point to pieces two spaces away.  Pieces may point orthogonally or diagonally.  Flip the piece pointed at: it's out of the game for this round.  The round ends when one player doesn't have a move.  At that point, score one point for the last player to make a legal move, flip all the pieces face up, and continue from that position.  Keep playing rounds until one player has six points.

Row-of-Four -- 4 in a row Tic-tac-toe.

Void -- The object is to play the last piece. Played pieces point orthogonally or diagonally to an empty space into which the next piece must be played. Single arrows point to spaces one spaces away and double arrows point to spaces two spaces away.

Each unit and commander which fought or could have fought in the campaign is rated for its movement, combat and leadership capabilities. The Confederates are vastly outnumbered, but boast fine commanders such as Robert E. Lee, Thomas A. Stonewall Jackson and James Longstreet. The Union Army is fighting on its own ground and is much more powerful than the Confederate forces, but has difficulty bringing that might to bear. If they can, the war might end sooner. If the Confederates succeed, they might swing Maryland to the Southern side.

Each piece has two sides. One side consists of two curves and is used for making turns. The other side is cross-shaped and is used for going straight - no right-angle turns are allowed at the center of the cross!

Play begins! The opponents choose for either Offensive or Defensive play. The Offense goes first, and puts his playing piece either side up, curved or crossed, on any square on the board. His objective is to construct an unbroken pathway with the crosses and curves from any one side of the playing board to its opposite side. The Defense goes second, with the single objective of diverting the Offense, thus stopping it from completing a path between two opposite sides. The players alternate turns and once a player has placed a piece on the board and removed his hand that play is final. Remember, players are free to place pieces on any square on the board without being required to touch a previously played piece.

The pathways will turn and wind and even cross over themselves as the two players attempt to out-maneuver each other. If one path comes to a dead end, the Offense simply begins another until one is completed and he becomes the winner.

If he fails to do so before all 32 pieces have been played, the Defense wins the game.

Players must race across the grid-based board from the Gallic Village to Cleopatra's Palace, deposit their Palace card, and then return to the Village. The first player to return is the winner. The board is divided into two halves, one sea and one desert.

Movement is card based, and each card has two possible uses. Pirate cards can be used to move the indicated number of spaces on either half of the board, or they can be used to place a Pirate Sword across any three squares of the sea half. Roman cards can be used to move on either half of the board or to place a Roman pilum (spear) on the desert half of the board and Magic potion cards can be used to move the player pawn or to remove any one sword or pilum.

The board has many choke points that can be blocked by swords or spears, though it is forbidden to totally block access to Cleopatra's palace or the Gallic Village.

Players may also gain Papyrus cards by passing over certain spaces on the board, and these cards generally allow the player to move one of the opposing players up to three spaces in any direction.

11425,40 Overs,1997,5.81667,6,0,2,2,0,0,,Sports ,Card Drafting,"40 Overs is a simple card game that pits two players against each other as Sunday League cricket teams.

First one player bats for 40 overs, or until 10 wickets are lost, trying to score as many runs as possible.  The opponent attempts to take those 10 wickets and otherwise limit the scoring.  Players then switch roles and the player with the higher score wins.

Each over consists of the bowling team selecting a card (from a hand of 4) then the batting team responding with a card (initially from a hand of 5, but decreasing as wickets fall).  Each card can be read either as a Batting or Bowling card, but can often only be used in a certain range of overs.

Bowling cards are either Fielding (cards which reduce the number of runs scored this over) or Special (cards which, for example, produce wickets or allow a player to discard and replace a hand).

Batting cards are similarly Runs Scored (which add runs, minus any Feilding card) or Special (which, for example, defeat wicket appeals).

Card distribution (44 cards total):

Fielding cards: 15
Special Bowling cards:  29

Runs Scored cards:  25
Special Batting cards:  19

So said Sir Horatio Nelson. During World War II, fortresses had many guises and some had to be fought. No Sailor But a Fool lets you do just that.

No Sailor But a Fool is Command at Sea Vol. 3, covering coastal actions. No Sailor consists of a 64 page book (full color cover) with 210 full color die cut counters, printed both sides (for a total of over 400 separate counters). Seven heavily researched scenarios covering Oslo 1940, Operation Sea Lion, British Channel Convoys, the St. Nazaire action, Operation Cerebus (the breakout of the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau through the English Channel), German surface raider sorties, and Tarawa.

The counters, by Steve Pancrazio (from Supermarina I), represent 140 ships ranging in size from motor torpedo boats up through battleships, as well as aircraft, shore batteries, shore installations and amphibious assault troops.

In order to use No Sailor But a Fool you must own the Standard Rules to Command at Sea and one of the two data annexes that were included in The Rising Sun or Supermarina I boxed games.

While Rommel's Afrika Korps was capturing the attention of the world, its fate was being decided in the Mediterranean sea. No matter how brilliantly the Field Marshal and his troops performed, the struggle could not be won without the supplies and equipment necessary to fight.

Supermarina II, Volume 4 in Larry Bond's Command at Sea portrays the apex of the struggle for naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, the vital supply link for both the Axis and Allied sides in North Africa.

Containing two dozen new scenarios, Supermarina II shows the full range of operations that were the naval war in the Mediterranean Sea. Covering the period from July of 1941 to August of 1942, Supermarina II details everything - from U-boat attacks on battleships and aircraft carriers, to all out big-gun fleet engagements between battleships and cruisers.

There are several scenarios that are highly suitable for solitaire play, a campaign scenarios depicting the many vicious Malta convoy battles, including Operations Harpoon, Pedestal, Vigorous and Halberd.  Also the classic surface engagements of First and Second Sirte, as well as the battles of the Malta striking forces.

Sea of Dragons concerns conflicts among 16 nations of the Pacific Rim, all of whom have their own agenda and means to try to advance it. The scenario book includes a brief introduction to the political and economic aspirations of the potential belligerents, and is followed by a discussion of their capabilities and military plans for the immediate future. There are 4 scenario sets containing a total of 26 engagements, many of which are suitable for solitaire play. The scenarios can be played individually or as part of a mini-campaign. And just in case 26 scenarios are not enough, a scenario generator for the hotly contested Spratly Islands is also included.

The fleet and air force lists contain all the platforms currently in service plus those expected to come on line over the next few years. Rounding things out is an extensive bibliography and reference section and errata for Harpoon 4 rules and data annex.

The Data Annex contains almost every platform available since 1980 as well as quite a few older ones that are now out of service. The vast majority of the data on the weapons and sensors are new and have previously not been listed in Harpoon 4. This wealth of information will allow the modern naval enthusiast to explore various combinations of systems, much as the nations involved do when preparing threat analysis.

Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia, Iskra being the northern part of the wider Soviet 19421943 winter counter offensive

The city of Leningrad, second largest in the USSR, had been cut off by the Germans since September 8, 1941. Now, sixteen months later, the Soviets were about to make their third attempt to relieve the city. The first attack in January 1942 had led to the mauling of the 2nd Shock Army in the swamps to the south, and a second failure between Sinyavino and Mga in the summer of 1942 had also taken heavy casualties, although it had completely derailed von Manstein's planned assault on the city itself. Now in January of 1943 the Red Army was set to try again.

Uses the same game system rules as the following Clash of Arms Games games, the award winning Black Sea Black Death, Aachen and Borodino '41.

The game is set in a frozen peat bog, bordered by a frozen lake and a frozen river, is a slugging match. German fortified lines cut through the snow filled woods and encircle the worker's settlements and the critical Sinyabino Heights.

The Red Army appears for the most part in regiment sized units of riflemen, artillery and heavy mortars, backed up by battalions of tanks (half of them light T-60s), skiers, marines, engineers, as well as by naval artillery, air power, and a few odd units like aerosans and observation balloons.

The Germans have most of their units in infantry and artillery battalions, backed up by companies of Tiger and Pzkw.III tanks, deadly 88mm flak guns, and STUG IIIs. The Germans also field everything from a battalion of Spanish fascists to a railroad battery. They also field battalions of heavy artillery, nebelwerfers, and captured French coastal guns, as well as mountain troops, jaegers, the SS Polizei Division, and several overstrength independent regiments plus their Tiger tanks (here seen in their debut performance).

The autumn of 1944 found the troops of Marshal Malinowskis Second Ukrainian Front sweeping through the Carpathian Mountains and onto the broad plains of Hungary. Behind them lay Romania and the wreckage of the German 6th and 8th Armies. Ahead of them lay Budapest and Vienna and the battered lines of German and Hungarian defenders. The men of the Red Army were confident of a quick and easy victory. Appearances were deceiving, however.

Near the city of Debrecen the Russian Advanced Guard encountered, not the remnants of an already defeated force, but four full-strength panzer divisions, eager for revenge. They would clash in one the great battles of the Second World War. The result would be the last real victory for the Germans in the East, the last time that the Wehrmacht could slug it out toe to toe with a full strength German force. The victory, however, was close and might well have gone the other way.

It is this situation that The Last Panzer Victory seeks to simulate. The last Panzer Victory is a fast paced, mobile, hard hitting game of operational warfare on the Eastern Front. The elegant game system realistically portrays armored combat in World War II. The effects of weather, supply, artillery, air power, and headquarters are represented through accurate yet playable rules, whose design features include: An interactive turn sequence - Special stacking and zones of control rules to reflect the unique conditions of the Eastern Front  Extensive unit specialization rules to simulate the unique unit capabilities and liabilities.

The board game is a dice-based arena combat game between two contestants.  It can result in some tense, close combats.  There are many different dice and many combinations of dice available, so choosing your dice before the combat is an important part of the game.

Each contestant has four dice that define him.  Four dice of the same type can be used, but that limits the player's abilities. The dice were collectible: there were quite a few different types made, some more powerful than others.  All dice are six-sided and have special glyphs on them.

To fight, players each roll all four of their dice and count up symbols for initiative.  Low initiative has to state his action first, then the higher initiative character can respond.

Attacks are resolved by announcing the type of attack attempted and throw the dice again.  This time the player is looking for Strike and Special glyphs.  The opponent declares his action and rolls and hopes to get defensive, counterstrike, and special glyphs.  Players record damage, and continue until only one fighter is conscious.

Some of the glyphs include: Unarmed combat, various magic spells, knockdown, bypass armor, poison, luck (reroll some dice!), roll with the blow, strike again, counterstrike, disarm, berserk, centered, zealous, sword, stun, skill+, and many others.  All are described in detail in the 96-page book.  (Only about a quarter of the book is pertinent to the arena combat game; the rest is for the RPG.)

Each side consists of thirteen pieces: three Masters, four Officers, and six Pawns. Each side's pieces should be easily distinguishable by color. A Mastery set can be built easily by scavenging the pieces from two identical chess sets, using Rooks for Masters, Knights for Officers, and Pawns for Pawns.

There are two ways to win. If either player ever loses (A) all three of its Masters, or (B) all of it's Officers and Pawns, leaving nothing but one or more Masters, that player has lost, and the game is over. Either side may also resign the game to his opponent. 
There are no conditions for a draw in Mastery according to the game's formal laws, but many house rules exist for determining draw conditions.

Albuera is a simulation of the Peninsular War battle of that name. The game is for two players. One commands the French forces and the other the Allied troops of the Spanish, British and Portuguese. Each player in turn maneuvers his troops on the map according to the restrictions of terrain, leadership, and morale, trying to cause or avoid combat between adjacent units at the end of each movement phase. Artillery can bombard at a distance, with range and target density effects, and a new game-system shows the difference between the traditional arms of cavalry and infantry. The infantry commands slug it out at close musket attrition while the cavalry looks for broken or demoralized targets for their 'death or glory' charges.

The object of the game is to avoid becoming the Man in the Moon.
The first player places one of her counters on any space on the board, except the center square. Then the second player places one of his counters on any space on the board, except the center square, and so on until the twenty-four counters have been placed, leaving the center square empty.
The first player now moves one of her counters to the center square. The second player then has his turn, and each then plays in succession. The counters may be moved orthogonally, but not diagonally.
When a player flanks one or more opposing counters between two of his own, they are all captured as long as there are no intervening empty spaces.  (Similar to Othello's flanking conversion.)
Counters may be captured only by a moving player. If one or more counters are caught between two opposing counters while the counters are being placed on the board, it does not count as a capture. Capturing does not begin until all twenty-four counters have been placed on the board.
If a player cannot move because her counters are blocked, the other player must continue moving until the blockade is raised. Then the blocked player takes her turn and play goes on as before. This rule also applies to the first move of the game.
The player who succeeds in reducing her opponent to one counter wins the game, the single counter left on the board becoming the Man in the Moon.

Both players take turns moving one of their three animals (Camel, Zebra, or Lion). After each move, turn over the octagon that the animal stood on before the move.

[Chicago, Chicago! was a] serious attempt to model the situation...Non-war games were never expected to be hits...While most game topics were selected by ST readers, we did allow ourselves an editor's choice once a year, and this was often  something like the Chicago game.  Dunnigan went on to say he didn't favor the hippies or cops in the conflict.  I was always interested in modeling non-military conflicts. You can't take sides if you want to do it right.

11523,Let's Play Tag,1958,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,Children's,Children's Game ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Let's Play Tag simulates the classic children game of Tag on a board.

Players choose their own playing pieces and one of them (he or she who spins the lowest number) becomes It.  The It sets aside his or her piece and uses the It arrow-shaped marker instead, placing it in the central Safety Zone.  The other players start off in the red squares marked with S.  The players take turns to play, spinning the dial twice to obtain the number of moves they can make.  Players can move their pieces in any direction; It, however, must move in the direction of its arrow until it reaches a red square, whereupon it can turn in any direction.

If It lands on a player's piece, that player becomes It, exchanging his or her piece for the marker; the former It takes back his piece and starts in the Safety Zone.  If a player's piece lands onto It's rear from behind, he or she scores 10 points.  Nobody can become It or score points in the Safety Zone.

The game ends when a player scores a total of 50 points and is declared the winner.

To start the game, you assemble the frame pieces, which create a space large enough to hold 20 tiles. Players alternate placing tiles in the frame - each player places the tiles with his opponent's color on them. When finished there will be two empty spaces in the maze. Put an energy token on a every circle of its color, and each player starts with one energy token in their reserve. Trovers and guards are placed in opposite corners and the movement part of the game begins.

On your turn, you move all your pieces. Guards can move up to five spaces orthogonally, while trovers can move like guards but also diagonally.

Trovers are the only pieces that can pick up energy tokens - you can only collect your own color. Guards simply block your opponent's trover, though if he pays one energy token he can move by a guard. The tiles create a two-level maze, with ramps printed on the tiles to change between levels, and walls occasionally to force movement around them. You can pay one energy token to have your trover jump down from the upper level to an adjacent lower level space.

If you spend an energy token, you can morph the maze: move a tile to an adjacent empty space. You may do this as much as you like and can afford during a turn. Morphing does not allow you to rotate a tile, only slide it to an adjacent, empty space.

The first player to collect all nine energy tokens of his color on the board wins.

On a turn a player throws two dice and uses one for each pawn.  Moving around the outside track can give you various cards, cartridges (upgrades for your phone system), etc.  Moving through the offices gives orders (money/VP) to the player whose office gets landed on.

The object is to have the highest level of Merlin system and get 50 orders.  Players need to cash in orders to upgrade from the lower-level systems, and the better your system the more orders your office produces.

The game came in two formats - a standard boxed game and a punch-out version in a large envelope.

11640,Klabberjass,1930,6.66667,24,2.75,2,2,45,45,,Card Game ,Set CollectionTrick-taking,"From The Complete Book of Indoor Games by Peter Arnold:

Klabberjass is probably best known in America than in England, because under the names of Clabber,Clobber, Clubby, Klab and Klob, it occurs in Damon Runyon's amusing stories,and in 1937 a variation of the game, jo-jotte was publicized by Ely Culbertson. Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)

Klabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of Schmeiss which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)

After bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.

Non-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce Bella on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.

After the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:

Jass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points
Menel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.
Any Ace 11 points
Any 10 10 points.
Any King 4 points.
Any Queen 3 points.
Any Jack 2 points.
Last Trick 10 points.

If the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or Sink points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.

Prior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.

Klabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules. It is very popular in New England and especially Hartford, Connecticut.

Players take turns drawing a card from either the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile in hopes of completing their sets.

Aside from Character Cards, there are special cards that augment play:

Olaf's Eye - lets you see another players hand.

Burning House - Lets you destroy a set of another player

Mr. Poe - Forces another player to make another set

Lemony Snicket - Disables ALL other special cards

Beatrice - acts as a wild card in completing your sets

Sadly the Object of this game is not to have a pleasant experience, for any game involving the Baudelaire Orphans will surely end in disappointment. However should one choose to play anyway, his or her objective is to be the first player to collect a majority of seven victory cards. One victory card is awarded to the winner of each round.

11645,Due Secoli di Guerre,1982,6,6,0,2,4,30,30,Abstract Wargames,Abstract Strategy Bluffing Dice Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"In 1982 two Italian journalists and historians, Indro Montanelli and Mario Cervi, published a 10-volumes encyclopedia about the history of the modern wars: from American Revolution to latest conflicts (Korea and Vietnam). The name of the work has been Due Secoli di Guerre: Two Centuries of Wars

Emilio Ceretti, chief of the Editrice Giochi, asked to Alex Randolph to invent a boardgame inspired to the encyclopedia.

Being impossible to simulate battles in a period of time from gunpowder to jet fighters, the result is a sort of an abstract wargame which tries to contain some fixed elements of war: strength vs. mobility, random factor, and bluff.

The game components are:
-a board with an irregular tessellation
-60 grey pieces with 3 holes each
-120 flags, 30 for every color (red, green, yellow, blue)
-the bluffing bell

Every player gets 30 flags of his color, and places them on 15 grey pieces. A piece with 3 flags has strength 3 and can move one space. A piece with 2 flags has strength 2 and can move up to two spaces and I think the readers can guess the features of a piece with one flag on it

Every player enters his units in the map from one side, and tries to win being the first to reach the opposite side with one of his units.

The combat system is quite original, and uses the bluffing bell. This is a little device similar to an hand-bell, containing two little 6-sided dices. Shaking the device makes the dices roll, and pressing the device on the table causes the dices to be blocked on their result. After the pressing of the bell, the player who is using it can pull it up and see the result, without showing it to other players. The player can repeat the shaking a number of times equal to the number of his flags involved in the combat, until he is satisfied (or wants to feign to be satisfied) by the result: at this point he can declare a result (obviously he can declare a number different from the real one!)
The opponent can now accept the declared result, and then try to get and declare an higher number; elsewhere he can try to see the bluff

Entering the central red square allows the player to aim an artillery shot to an enemy unit.

According to Alex Randolphs ludography compiled by Philippe Evrard, Due Secoli di Guerre has been published only in Italy by Editrice Giochi, and there is no report about editions in other countries.

Each player starts at one end of the board, and the goal of the game is to capture or convert the pieces of your opponent.

Tiles can be moved 1 place horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You can move one level going up, there is no limitation going down. This means that you can jump on tiles of your opponent if they are at the same height or lower. In this way you convert tiles of your opponent to your own colour. Tiles always move individually: you do not move entire stacks, just the stack's top tile. When capturing, you capture the entire stack.

You can surrender to tiles of your opponent if they are at the same height or higher. Instead of jumping on top of the stack, you slide underneath it. Your tile is not flipped, and it keeps its own colour. It is a prisoner of that stack. But if a stack holds a majority of prisoners (more than half), there is a revolution. The prisoners become free, and the top tile (and all other tiles of the stack) change to the colour of the prisoners.

The game ends if one of the players can make no more moves.

Each side, red and blue, have 21 pieces with simple illustrations to distinguish them: one sorcerer, three wizards, three hunters, three warriors, five archers, and six soldiers.  In addition there are seven yellow pieces representing treasure to be captured.

The board is a hexagon of hexagons (think Settlers, but it's not geomorphic).  Each edge of the entire hexagon is made up of six smaller hexagons.  These are in three colors: red, blue, and yellow, such that no two hexes of the same color border each other.  Two of the corners have castles printed in them.

Players take turns moving one piece at a time.  Each of the pieces moves and captures differently.  Basic chess-like rules apply: one piece per space, you can't move through a piece (though there are some knight-like pieces that can jump), land on a piece to capture it, promotion of the lesser pieces if the reach the opposite side, etc.

There are five different victory conditions given in the rules.  Players must decide on victory conditions before beginning the game.  They can be combined, such as Sudden Death (capture the opponent's sorcerer) and Castle Occupation (just what you think it means).  The treasure pieces aren't used unless one or both of the treasure victory conditions are in play.

That's basically it.  The pieces are rather bland, but the board is a must for abstract game designers who think in primary colors ...

In both games, a variety of piratical types are adrift on a raft and gradually some get thrown in the water. At the end of the process, one type is left on the raft and you score for each card you have kept of that type. In the short game, you go through the process once, in the long game, you repeat the process, removing cards from the deck each round.

The cards have nice graphics of the crew, the captain, the cook, the look-out, the cabin-boy, the dancing girl, the parrot and so on, each with values 1-9. Players are dealt a hand and five cards are dealt up in a row, and several cards are dealt face down in a column. The first of these is turned up and each turn the next is shown. At the end of the round, the type with the majority points is the one ejected.

Players play one card from their hand and draw from the row, and so try to manipulate events, especially by using the parrot. Unlike the others, the parrot has special abilities, allowing you to sneak a look at the last 2 cards in the face-down column, add another card to the column or thrown one out.

It took a while to get the hang of the game and it's an odd mix of switching tactics, but the long variant may be too elongated for repeated play.

The game was old by the time it was played in Ancient Rome, since it had been played in Greece and other parts of the ancient world before it found its way to Rome. The game has many counterparts throughout the Middle East and Asia. Some historians indicate that the game may have had its origins in some religious rite, while others believe the game was always just a gambling game.

Knucklebones are the dried ankle bones of sheep. They have 4 different sides - one flat, one concave, one convex, and one sinuous side. Values were assigned to each side. The game is played with two or more bones. One player tosses the bones in the air and either catches them on the back of the hand, or lets them fall to the ground. As in dice games, assigned values determine the outcome of each toss. In ancient times, adults as well as children played Knucklebones. The Greeks and the Romans modified the equipment and play of this gambling game, eventually passing on to us six sided cubed dice rather than the four sided Astragali.

Each country also has a numbered circle indicating half the length of the countrys name (rounded up; two circles for countries whose names have an even number of letters). Each player (or partnership) receives a bag of letter tiles, which contains just enough to cover all the letters on the map.

High-speed rules summary from the instructions:

RULE 1: In each turn place one or more letters, anywhere, or store up all of them. End the turn by drawing four, always.

RULE 2: Earn country flags -- coloured markers -- once youve covered as many letters as the circles show. (Only one flag of your colour in any country! The enemy may share countries with two circles, if you dont prevent this.)

RULE 3: Flags on EIGHT connected countries wins -- or ELEVEN in games with the Airports rule. (Two extra letters earn an airport ring over the flag. Groups connect by air when each group has an airport.)

11729,Alley Oop,1937,0,0,0,2,4,15,15,,Action / Dexterity Comic Book / Strip ,,"Alley Oop was a popular North American newspaper cartoon strip during the 1920s, 30s, 40s and beyond.

The game comes in a cardboard 'can' container with tin lids. The drumstick-like pieces in the game are elongated round wooden bulbs attached to wooden sticks. There are four of each color used in the game. They are the stylized clubs used by Alley and his friends in the cartoon, and are known as Oops. The lever-like pieces are also made of wood. Each of these pieces are placed on a table, pointed side down, and with a see-saw movement can propel an Oop.

The idea of the game is to place the head of an OOP over the groove in the FLIPPER then strike the FLIPPER downward, thereby sending the OOP into the air and (you hope) into the CAN. Equipment consists of 18 units: 3 each Green, Yellow, Blue and Red OOPS, 1 Black OOP (Foozy), 4 Colored Flippers, and the CAN. Each OOP, according to color, represents a different value. GREEN - 1 Point, YELLOW - 2, BLUE - 3 Points, RED - 4, BLACK (Foozy) - 5 Points.

The simplest configuration therefore resembles a mini Stone Henge (hence the name).

The space in between can be empty or occupied by a piece of either color.

One player is attempting to connect the top and bottom of the board and the other player the left and right edges.  Connectivity is judged as seen from above so that higher pieces can cut the connection of lower ones.  Or to quote the rules:

Two sects of Druids want to build a monument on the same sacred site, however there is some conflict. The followers of Horizontus believe that the monument should track the sun from the East horizon to the West horizon to worship the passing days, while the followers of Verticalus believe that the monument should track the sun from the North to the South to worship the passing seasons.

The game has several variants including a version played on a hex grid (also playable by three) and both the hexagonal and square versions have a Druid's Walk variation in which an additional piece represents a druid out for a stroll.

11757,Star Trek Game,1975,5,3,0,2,6,0,0,,Movies / TV / Radio theme ,,"Box blurb says:
Deep Space Mission Briefing. Captain's Log Stardate 30.26.5. The Enterprise is menaced by a deadly Klingon War Ship. Only Zithium and Beton Crystals from the Planet of Fire and the Ice Planet can destroy it.
Your Mission. Bring back both Crystals and plant them in the War Ship Bridge. Look out for the Blurg, the Spider and the Klingons.  Also look Out For Refuge Squares, Avoid Capture, Closed Circuit TV, Alarms and the Baroom Card!!

This Star Trek Game is a board game for two to six players produced in 1975 by Palitoy for the UK game market. This game is TOS-based, and was advertised as Taken from the popular BBC TV Series Star Trek. Much of the game's artwork seems to have been done by  or at least, influenced by  the artists who worked on the Gold Key Star Trek comic. Players play crewmembers of the Enterprise assigned to obtain alien crystals from two planets that can be used to destroy a nearby Klingon warship, while avoiding capture by either the Klingons or the indigenous creatures on either planet.

Gameplay: The object of the game is to land on two planets  the Planet of Fire and the Ice Planet  to retrieve a sample of Zithium and Beton (respectively) to use against the Klingons and destroy their ship.
As crewmembers of the Enterprise, you have been assigned to obtain a crystal of each substance from their respective plantes, while avoiding a giant alien spider (which protects the crystals on the Planet of Fire) and an amorphous blob called a Blurg (who protects the crystals on the Ice Planet).

Each player starts in the Enterprise transporter room and tries to roll the number of the transporter pad to which they are assigned to beam down to one of the planets. (If they cannot do this within three rolls, they beam down automatically.) The player then traverses the game path on the planet to try and reach the cavern containing the crystals at the path's end. Players can obtain help from Kirk or Spock by landing on the space with their picture. They can also be captured if landed on by either creature or a Klingon (spaces on the path allow either the creatures to move or the Klingons to beam down to the planets), but by the player having Kirk and/or Spock with them, the player can have their senior officer stun their attacker and continue play.

Once a player obtains the crystal from one planet, they return to the Enterprise and go through decontamination (moving along the red and white path near the transporter room). They then return to the transporter (via the yellow and green path) and attempt to beam down to the other planet and get the second crystal. They then return to the Enterprise and undergo decontamination again before proceeding to the Enterprise's airlock and attempting to board the Klingon ship. From their, the player must enter the Klingon bridge, plant the crystals, and beam back to the Enterprise and undergo decontamination a third time before landing on the Detonator space and playing the Baroom card on the Klingon ship, thus destroying it and winning the game.

11780,ASG Baseball,1973,6.85714,14,4,1,2,30,30,,Sports ,Simulation,"ASG Baseball is a tabletop baseball simulation which uses individual batter and pitcher cards and dice to accurately recreate games between Major League Baseball teams. The game's distinctivie design feature is that batter-pitcher encounters are resolved by rolling the dice and consulting the pitcher's card. In some cases the outcome of the play is determined directly from the pitcher's card. In other cases the pitcher's card may direct you to a specific column (one of six) on the batter's card for the play result. The columns on the batter's card are organized to reflect the batter's normal, above-normal, and below normal batting average and slugging percentage.  Advocates of the game argue that dominant pitchers are more realistically simulated by this play design in that they exert more control over the outcome of each at bat than is the case for better-known baseball boardgames such as APBA and Strat-O-Matic.

ASG also includes clutch hitting, errors, fielders' range, fielders' arm strength, infielders' double play ability, catchers' pitch calling, balks, wild pitches, stolen bases, stamina and unusual plays.

The game was introduced in 1973 with player cards based upon the 1972 major league season.  The following year the company issued player cards based upon the 1973 season.  Afterward, faced with demands from the Major League Players Association for royalty payments for the use of player and team names, the game creator ceased production until the game was resurrected by 3W Games in the late 1980's.  Later, the board game was adapted to the personal computer and the software was sold under the name Diamond Dreams.  As of 2011 neither the boardgame nor the computer version is being produced and marketed.

Instead they must remember all of those objects and avoid them when naming something themselves. Whoever first names something said previously be an opponent loses the game, and everyone else wins.

Planetaire is a game of planetary war.  From the surface, through the atmosphere, and into outer space, two players battle using fighters, mother ships, killer satellites and beam tanks.

Description:

Planetaire is an abstract strategy game played on a board of four concentric circular tracks (orbits). A player takes one action on a turn; an action can be moving a piece, attacking with a piece, or loading or unloading fighters (which can be carried by motherships).

The different pieces move and attack differently. Fighters move two spaces a turn and can only attack adjacent pieces. Motherships can move one space or jump into hyperspace from the outer orbit (allowing them to re-enter any space in the outer orbit on a later turn), and they have beam weapons which can attack pieces two or three spaces away. Beam tanks and killer satellites also have beam weapons; beam tanks can only move around the inner orbit and satellites can only jump into hyperspace.

The object of the game is to remove all opposing pieces from the inner orbit.

When an electron moves adjacent to any other electron, the non-moving electron is repelled and must move away; if it cannot, the moving electron moves away. The repelled electrons may cause others to move, etc. The object is to get all of one's own electrons into the opponent's starting spaces.

11808,Prospecting,1982,7.43333,3,0,2,4,60,60,,American West Economic ,,"Prospecting is, as might be imagined, a game of prospecting somewhere in the 19th-century American West (the map is not of a real area, although the place names are similar to some found in Montana).

The map is divided into numerous small areas which the players claim and then attempt to find something in.  Every area has a potential number which indicates how likely it is to find something (fertile soil, coal, copper, silver, of gold) there.  Each number has an associated set of outcomes for a 2-dice roll, which in addition to finding something include action cards from the deck, action cards from other players, income, and monetary penalties.  Areas not likely to produce soil, coal, or minerals are more likely to provide cards or income.

Once you find something, you get paid for the claim and that area is done with.  Some things pay better than others, with gold of course paying the most, but this is offset by the fact that making the same strike in an adjacent area will pay double (and a third will double again, etc.), and the less valuable items are easier to find.

Action cards can be used to rob or tax other players, travel faster around the board, squat on someone else's claim, etc.  The take that effect is presumably somewhat reduced by the small hand size (2 in a 4-player game).

The attention to usability in the components is somewhat unusual for a self-published game of this vintage.  Each player gets a calculator which lets you slide a cardboard strip up and down to get the dice-rolling chart for each claim potential (and robbery attempt) individually, instead of having to look it up in a larger chart.  In addition, each calculator has on it a probability table which shows the total percent chance of each possible outcome for each claim potential, and a list of all the action cards and their uses.

Players score points for each reproductive ant released during a nuptial flight.

A deck of cards provide environmental events and different genetic traits for the various ant species.  Conflict between colonies is possible but is not the primary focus of the game.  All events, traits, and general game play are based on the natural history of actual ant species.

Published in 1978,  100yds/hex; 15 min./turn. 21 different types of terrain on the TEC. Morale ratings from 11-66. 12 point unit facing and flexible extended line options.  As a result of a morale check a unit can take cover, become shaken, rout, or rout move. Simple but effective command and control rules:  the further a unit from its HQ, the lower its movement allowance.  A unit moving more than half its MA loses firepower during the enemy portion of the turn; if it moves more than its printed allowance (fatigue rules), it can't fire during the enemy portion of the turn.  The game is so detailed, it includes stubble markers for use when Miller's Cornfield is mowed down by fire, and has a beehive rule for use if Mr. Roulette's beehives are smashed by artillery fire.

Designed by Kim Turner, James Murphy, Arthur Mitchell and David Buchbinder.

No other pre-20th Century game has anything like its historical accuracy and richness of detail, John Kisner wrote in a review in 1978, when TSS had a lock on the top spot in SPI's game ratings.  The game is by no means perfect, even disregarding its physical shortcomings, but with its publication, the state of the art in 19th Century tactical games has made as broad and deep an advance as it did with the publication of the original LA BATAILLE DE LA MOSCOWA, he added.

     Kidnap and Rescue is a capture-the-flag game for 2-4 players.  Move to the captive, become the captive, and put your own pawn home.  Everyone else continues to try to get the captive, which is now you.  If someone catches you, they become the captive, and you re-enter from home.  Try to get the captive home!



     Spy Against Spy is another intentionally lopsided 2-player game, but this time the effect is a little more like American football.  The defender merely obstructs the offender as much as possible to minimize her progress over the course of ten turns.



     Runaway School Bus is a 1-player timed race, with the interesting twist that the timing is staged.  There are five points along the bus's path where you can intercept it.  You merely need to progress, by die roll of course, along your linear path more quickly than the bus to maximize your score.  This game features a small misprint, since if you don't count the picture of a schoolbus as a space for the bus, getting 5 points is quite literally impossible.  You can't get 14 out of two rolls of a six-sided die - it's low enough odds on three rolls.

     Championship Boxing is a 2-player game in which the players attempt to maneuver about the ring and punch one another when in range.  There are KO spaces along the players' punch tracks by which a player can hope for an early knockout of her opponent.



     Motorcycle Jumping is a 1-player game in which you try to jump as many buses as possible, based on your trajectory and height.  Most of your jump is determined by rolls of the die.



     Olympic Biathlon allows 2-4 players to cross-country ski and shoot their way to victory.  When you get to the shooting range determines the length of the path you take back to the main course once you've shot the target.

     Indy Pit Stop simulates an Indy 500-style race between 2-4 players.  This is a roll-and-move game with some unusual pitfalls along the track.  Once you have car trouble and have to make a pit stop, you roll a die to determine what the pit crew finds wrong with your car.  1-3 indicates a refueling is in order; 4, tire change; 5, spark plugs; and 6 means it's overheating.  The various problems can take different amounts of time to fix.



     Le Mans 24 Hour Race is a 1-player game.



     Off-Road Challenge Race is a roll-and-move race game with some zany track elements.  Spaces such as Other cars go ahead 4 and Go behind lead car provide unusual interaction of the vehicles.

     Pro Tennis simulates a tennis game for 2 players.  The areas of the court all have corresponding die rolls paired with them.



     Hang Gliding, for 2-4 players, is a roll-and-move game with some branches decided by the roll of a die, and others left up to the player's choice.  The various paths symbolize air currents, including some sharp up-drafts and down-drafts.  The players attempt to maneuver their pawns to the best-scoring landing zones.

     Outlaw and Stagecoach is a 2-player game that simulates a Western chase scene, in which the outlaw tries to chase down and rob the stagecoach.  The stagecoach moves one or two spaces (determined by a die roll) along a fixed path toward East City.  The outlaw moves one or two spaces forward or backward, and may utilize the shortcuts.  Once the outlaw ends a move on the same space as the stagecoach, a gunfight occurs.  The gunfight consists of the outlaw winning three out of three rounds of Who can roll a higher number on the die? - re-rolling in the event of a tie.  If the stagecoach wins the gunfight, it escapes with a free move.



     Shark Attack sends 2-4 players diving for treasure in slightly shark-infested waters.  On your turn, you roll a die, then move in orthogonal steps, generally toward the treasure.  You may not swim through other pawns.  If you start your turn in the shark attack zone, which is 4/7 of the playfield, then you will also roll and move the shark.  The shark may swim through other pawns, but if it ends its movement on a player's pawn, that pawn goes back to the boat and starts over.  The goal is not only to get past the shark to reach the treasure, but also return through the shark's waters to the boat thereafter.



     Alien Invaders From Space is a 1-player roll-and-move with a die-driven squad of aliens hunting you along the path.  A die roll indicates which 3-4 of six rooms are occupied by aliens.  For your attempted escape, each turn, you roll a die.  On an even roll, you move that many spaces; odd, the alien in the current room (if any) moves that many spaces, eventually getting into your path and threatening you.  One exception:  If you roll a 1, the aliens all get reset, and you roll again to determine their new three or four starting rooms.  You simply try to reach your rocket ship to Earth without a turn ending you and an alien on the same space.

11857,Triple Flips 4: Sci-Fiction,1981,6.15,8,1,1,4,0,0,,Dice Racing Science Fiction ,Dice Rolling,"Triple Flips 4 includes Save the Earth, Time Warp, and Robot Attack.


     Save the Earth is a 1-player game that seems to be inspired by Missile Command.  Four missiles are bearing down on Earth, and you make straight, orthogonal moves based on the die roll, trying to hit the missiles before they reach Earth.  Each turn, the missiles advance - although, if you are blocking a missile's path downward, it will wait until you are out of the way to advance.  You essentially have 9 turns to fly around frantically to destroy the four missiles - well, 7 for two of them.



     Time Warp is a simple elimination game for 2-4 players, comprising two concentric, rectangular tracks - past and future - interconnected at four points by time machines.  That is the gimmick.  Roll, then move one way or the other, trying to land on an opponent to eliminate her.  If you land on a time machine, you may use it to switch tracks and go again.



     Robot Attack is a 2-player game, which seems related to Hnefatafl.  One player tries to traverse the passageways, by orthogonal moves from her die roll, to her spaceship, which conveniently lies behind the opponent's four robots.  The robot player tries to trap the other player with his robots, by splitting each roll among however many robots he wishes.  Not only are the robots inherently  the speed of the spaceman, but they also are unable to move backward, toward the ship.  As a result, the robot player must be attentive in his move choices.  Fortunately for him, most of the board has four or fewer chokepoints to cover at any given vertical slice; unfortunately, players are neither allowed to waste pips from their die roll, nor retread a space on the same turn.

     Steeplechase Championships, for 2-4 players, uses a linear path of obstacles, each labeled with the rolls (on two dice) required to pass it.  For instance, to start, you need to roll 2-5; then to clear the water jump, 6-9; then for the brick wall, 10-12.  To clear the logs at the end, you need to roll doubles.



     Ride-em Cowboy (a rodeo game for 1-4 players) is a game in which it is appropriately difficult to score well.  Appropriately for simulating a rodeo, players often won't stay on the bronco long enough to score, but, on the other hand, occasionally someone will ride the whole way out.

     Curse of the Pyramid is a race game for 1 player.  You mark half the dice numbers as belonging to the mummy, then roll the die.  If the mummy's numbers get rolled, he moves toward the goal; if not, then you move the actual number rolled.  Of course, your path is substantially longer than his.  You also are required to change the mummy's numbers each turn.



     Vampire Attack lets 2-4 players attempt to bite each other.  On your turn, roll the die, then move orthogonally with up to one 90 turn per move, in an attempt to sidle up to another player.  Once you get orthogonally adjacent to an opponent, roll again.  A 1 (appropriately, the big, red pip) means you've bitten them and they're out of the game.



     Escape the Evil Castle is a spiteful race game for 2-4 players.  Players traverse a linear path toward the goal, advancing the roll of a die each turn.  However, your roll also moves Dracula, whom you can move in either direction.  If you move Dracula onto an opponent, she must move her pawn back to the 0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% mark.

The object of Sentence Says is to create a sentence out of letter cards that you are dealt, using each letter as the first letter of a word of your choice.  For example, the letter C could become Cat, Could or any word that you choose beginning with the letter C.

So, if you were dealt a hand consisting of the letters:  M,F,G,A,B,P, you could create the sentence: Freddy's Billy Goat Ate Pancakes Monday...or Get Powder Because My Foot Aches!.  You can arrange the cards in any order to create your sentence.  But you are under a time limit and the time depends on how many cards you are dealt (anywhere from 5-7 depending on the roll of the die).  There is also an action card that you must draw before turning over your cards.  The action cards give you an instruction for completing your sentence, such as Your sentence must be in the form of a question or Do not use a proper name.

Points are at the bottom of every card.  You accumulate points by creating an acceptable sentence within the time limit.  You can also wager points by stealing when an opponent misses a sentence.

The fun of the game is coming up with well thought-out sentences and hearing the silly sentences that people try to get away with (and of course, winning).  It's perfect to play a one on one session or in a large group at a party.

Sentence Says is brand new game and is available at select specialty retail outlets or online at www.sentencesays.com

A good deal of this game's audience is the convention going crowd and the designers purposely implemented tongue-in-cheek silliness to keep the game in perspective.

At the heart of the carnage battlefield is a reality-altering orb drawn along in a cart by two flamingo-dodoes.  The cart skips around the battlefield during the game causing random effects that help, hinder, annoy and amuse both sides.  Effects range from rain showers to muddy the ground and slow opponents to random teleportations.  Everything is all in the spirit of fun.

Overall, Carnage is a good, non-serious wargame that still requires some strategy to win.

Players alternate turns. Each turn, a player marks one of the squares with their symbol (X or O) and draws a line through the square and into two of the triangles on opposite sides. This creates a thorn. The players are attempting to create a continuous path of thorns from one side of the board to another. Thorns are considered touching if they touch or if their triangles overlap

The first player to create a continuous path from one side of the board to the other is the winner.

11933,Minitar,1967,0,0,0,2,2,45,45,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Political ,,"While Minitar has an ostensible political theme (the 1968 US presidential election), in fact it is a completely abstract game.

Each player has a deck of cards depicting the 50 states and Washington DC, plus a wild card.  On a turn a player draws a card and places it on the 8x8 board.  If it is the first card played in one of the rows in the player's half of the board, it can go anywhere in that row, otherwise it must be adjacent to one of his or her already-placed cards.  In addition, a card can be played on top of the opponent's card showing the same state (and the wild card can be played on top of any card).

The object is to connect the two ends of the board with a chain of cards in your color.  Whoever manages this gets points equal to the number of electoral votes for the states in the chain.  A match is won by the first player to reach 538 points.  It is also possible to win a game by making it impossible for the other player to move.

As the rules are quite simple, most of the 28-page rulebook is taken up by background information - on the US as it was in the 1960 census, politicians holding office in the states and the federal government, the 1956, 1960, and 1964 elections, etc.

11936,The Battle of Balaclava,1975,4.7,10,0,2,2,30,30,Wargames,Wargame ,,"While the rules call this a wargame, it is highly abstract and more of a family game.

The system is an interesting attempt at representing the general flow of a given battle with very simple rules.  The board consists of a (very sketchy) schematic of the battle area overlaid with arrows indicating the troop movements, much as one might see on a diagram of a battle.

The arrows are divided into spaces - on a turn, a player rolls a die and moves a piece (infantry or cavalry - the artillery does not move) along the appropriate arrow (which arrow or arrows it can use depends on where it starts).  Landing on certain spaces may let you advance further, or may destroy the piece (there are a number of the latter spaces on the Light Brigade's paths).  Getting to the end of an arrow destroys an enemy piece, generally, but sometimes has other effects on the opponent.

There are special rules for each group indicating what its orders are or what it actually did in the battle, more or less (some can traverse the arrows more than once, etc.).

While the box says that either 2 or 4 people can play, there is no provision in the rules for more than 2, and no obvious way to accommodate this.

Greensmith designed a similar game for Palitoy on the battle of Waterloo.

There are also some special cards, played as discards, to make it interesting:

Road Block -- Reverse direction and take another turn
Speed Trap -- Next player loses a turn
Parking Ticket -- Next player draws 2, cannot meld or discard
Hazzard County Clout -- Played in response to last 2 cards, reverses effects onto the original player.  No effect if simply discarded.
Hogg Wild -- Next player draws four, cannot meld or discard.

None of these special cards can be picked up from the discard pile except a Hazzard County Clout that has been discarded.  Scoring is the same as rummy, with a 50 point bonus for going out.  First player to 500 wins.

11958,Cup Final,1980,2,1,0,2,2,90,90,,Action / Dexterity Sports ,Simulation,"This game is very similar to the Palitoy Striker soccer game, but without the build quality or fun factor.

The pitch is made of a peculiar green material with a strange foam backing that sticks to the carpet; the goals are identical to the one in Striker, but with plastic netting. The game comes supplied with two teams - red and blue, but instead of 5 players per team of Striker, Cup Final only has 3 players on each side.

The two outfield players are plastic with a metal kicking leg, with one player having a bent leg, and one a straight leg. The straight legged player had a scooped foot for lobbing the ball, but this mechanism doesn't work very well. The kicking action is controlled by a button on the back of the base as opposed to the bash 'em on the head mechanism used in Striker. Additionally, the figures are very badly designed, and the slightest movement causes them to fall over (are they Christian Ronaldo in disguise?).

The goalkeepers are identical in design to the original Striker goalkeepers, as they swivel at the waist and have a crooked arm for throwing the ball out.

The ball is not round, but more of a honeycomb. One half of the ball is coloured red, the other half blue. The team whose colour is on the top face of the ball when it comes to rest has the right to play the ball, so the purpose of the game is always keep the top face of your colour visible while dribbling.

Basically it's a cheap reproduction of Striker by Palitoy. Avoid.

Each one tries to get to the card with the yellow border and the stalk on it first. If this is the case the corresponding player can take a carrot from the stock in the center as a reward. At once a new starting square has to be fixed: the old target card is simply turned over. The picture on the backside shows the new target square. Who can find the card which has the same picture? It marks the new square they must all aim for and the stalk is placed on it. Again the rabbits are zipping through the garden. Who will be lucky enough and clever enough to collect the largest amount of carrots? A surprising competition game with dice.

This is not just a roll and move game; choices must be made by the players on each turn.

Seven battleships and 3 merchant ships for each side. Equal combat capabilities for all ships, merchant ships take less damage. Probability of a hit depends on distance. Movement reduced for damaged ships. Movement is variable depending on wind direction and speed.

Long game: first player to get a merchant ship to away port and back home wins. Short game, points are awarded depending on the order that merchant ships get to away port. Very simple rules with examples. Away port is across the board diagonally from the home port meaning the players' paths cross, making battle likely.

The recent coup could provide the Germans with a ripe opportunity to step into the Middle East. The Iraqis requested German support when the British violated an agreement made in 1931 restricting British troops on Iraqi soil. Instead, the British created a major airbase at Habbinaya, east of Baghdad. In late April, the Iraqis began attacking the airbase with their 70 aircraft, 28 artillery guns and 20mm AA. The small British force had only obsolete aircraft to defend with and opposed by 5000 Iraqi troops. However, the Iraqi morale was low and it was hoped that the Luftwaffe would change this. Thus, began a month long battle. Hitler was preoccupied with events and only agreed to sent a token force to support the Iraqis commanded by Captain Junck. Junck had the job of stopping the advancing British relief force, destroying the Habbinaya airbase and raising Iraqi morale so their troops would occupy it.

The game comes with 150+ counters, various air displays, ground movement charts, ground and air units, 24 cards and 15 pages of rules. Both players will secretly plan their aircraft and ground units and hope everything then works out during the game turn.

12018,1st Alamein,1997,6.66522,23,1.7778,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Print & Play Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"1st Alamein is my (Lou Coatney's) 1997-designed free, print-and-play 2-player game about the opening battle for Alamein, in July 1942, which was Rommel's best chance to break through and take naval base Alexandria, Cairo, and the Suez.  It is the first part of my Battles for Alamein game set, and it is an ideal introductory game for the hex-and-counter game format.

It uses archaic (but surprisingly realistic) combat mechanics with active Zones of Control requiring combat - except of Allied units already in brigade boxes/fortifications - which can be taken and eliminated.

The icons/figures on the pieces are by my older son Robert, who was also the playtester to the point of helping me design the game.  (We have played it hundreds of times together, even in video telephone conversations.)  Graphics guru Patrick Tremoureux has used those to produce professional quality map and units.

The scale of the game is: 1 day of real time per (10) game-turn(s), approximately 6 miles/10 kilometers per hexagonal space width, and brigade-to-division (8,000-15,000 men) unit scale, which amounts to 12 ground units on each side.  It takes a little over an hour to play.

How much is a day?  Well, you start on a mountaintop and begin walking.  If you come back to the mountain by sundown, you get all the land you encircle.

The board is a 24x32 grid.  Each player drops a small cylinder to indicate their starting location, and then draw cards (generally) to move.  Each card indicates how far and in what direction you move (your boundary is indicated by plastic cones in your color) and how much time it took--around the board, a Sun token moves from Dawn to Dusk.  When the Sun token hits Dusk, the game is over.  If you end up back on your mountain, you get points equal to the area you have enclosed (plus how many spaces are in your boundary--for the Go-enabled, it's Chinese scoring).  If you're not on your mountain, you get nothing.  If nobody is on their mountain, the Bashkirs win--just like in the story...

12028,Counterpoint,1971,4.25,2,0,2,4,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"Counterpoint consists of a raised dark golden plastic board (two inches high and thirteen and a half inches in width and length... it fits rather precisely into the square box), four plastic player markers (green, red, blue, and yellow), and a single six-sided die.
There is no instruction manual; the instructions are printed on the back of the box's top.
The player markers are slightly oddly shaped for no apparent reason, and somewhat resemble modern art that's not supposed to look like anything in particular.  Stand a rectangle up so it's tall, then cut a very wide and short triangle out of one side, and that's the basic shape.
The board has a number of odd features.  The center of it is a square that sinks down slightly into a square piece of black foam.  This is where the die and player pieces rest when the game isn't being played.  Around the center of the board is a narrow track with black and white arrows that can be flipped horizontally to show an arrow pointing in the opposite direction.  In one direction, the arrow is black and the background is white... in the other direction, the colors are reversed.  Each corner of the board has a tiny colored slot for the appropriate player piece to rest just before start... however, the groove isn't very deep at all and it's easy for the tall pieces to get knocked out.
The game is very simple.  Two players take a clockwise route along one side of the track, and two others take a counterclockwise route along the other side.  A player rolls a die, and moves his piece the appropriate number of spaces.  If the final resting place for his piece is on a spot where the arrow is turned the wrong way, he must move back to the closest arrow that points in the proper direction, and then flips any arrows he wishes on the board equal to the number rolled on the die.  The first player that makes a full circle around the board and lands on or passes his starting point wins.

This is a boardgame based on the classic Micronauts toys.  Gameplay is the usual roll-the-die-and-take-a-card fare.

There are two stairways with bridges to the second level--a ring of spaces that sits above the center of the board.  The third level is a smaller ring set above this one.  Fourth level is a single space that sits above this.  Baron Karza, the bad guy, starts on level four.  If the characters land on certain spaces, they check the Intruder Control--a cardboard dial with its face hidden by a movable window.  They turn the dial however they wish, then open the window to see if Karza stays where he is, or teleports to one of four numbered spaces on the board.  Players must land on Karza's space by exact count to capture him.  Players may also land on their opponents' spaces, forcing said opponents to return to their starting space.

The body hung limply from the roadside apple tree, as General Buford and his staff rode by. Well, gentlemen, Buford noted grimly, I guess that's one more report that General Lee will have to do without!

The Gettysburg Campaign remains a source of endless interest to both historian and wargamer, in part for the many ways in which small acts of fate worked to shape the course of larger events. THE DEVIL'S TO PAY explores a little known, but quite plausible, alternate chain of events turning on one such small incident.

Longstreet's scout Harrison ends up swinging from an apple tree, festooned with one of John Buford's famous 'let him hang for 7 days' notes. Bereft of the knowledge that the AoP is NORTH of the Potomac and hot in pursuit, General Lee simply continues as before for a few days longer, with his 3 Corps following the orders that he had already historically given them. Ewell attacks the Harrisburg defenses, which fall after a day or so. The bridges are burned, but with the shallow water and fords, the city itself is taken a couple of days later (helped by Jenkins' taking of the Rockville RR bridge to the north). However, the Pa Reserves (Crawford's Division) have been rushed north from the Washington defenses, and with their help Couch has drawn a defensive line along the Swatara Creek, a few miles to the east of Harrisburg. Early moves north from York along the Harrisburg Pike, which follows the river from York Haven. Hill, and then Longstreet follow Ewell down the Cumberland Valley (to the NE) towards the Pennsylvania capitol. By July 2nd, the Confederate Army is badly strung out; Ewell has two of his Divisions (Rodes  Johnson) across the Susquehanna, with the third (Early) holding the West Shore. Hill is a couple of miles west in Mechanicsburg/Shiremanstown with Anderson's Division, while Heth and Pender's Divisions are ranged to the south holding the wide 'gap' at Dillsburg. Longstreet has two Divisions in Carlisle (Hood's  McLaw's), while Pickett is still a few miles to the west guarding the ever-lengthening supply line running south to Virginia. Jenkins' coup de main has resulted in the immense Union supply base at Harrisburg being captured almost intact, and every wagon that makes it west over the shallow ford means another day of supplies for the ANVA in the fall and winter to come.

With the Confederates now further to the north, the AoP continues to move forward on the Gettysburg/Hanover/Manchester line it had reached by June 30th. By the evening of July 2nd, Buford's Cavalry is skirmishing with Heth's troops in the Franklintown area. Reynolds has passed Petersburg (York Springs) and is moving forward with the I  XI Corps, with Sickles' III Corps and Merritt's Reserve cavalry Brigade in position to threaten the Mt. Holly Gap a few miles to the west, on the direct route between Gettysburg and Carlisle. Spurred on by the fall of Harrisburg, the rest of the Army of the Potomac is steadily marching north as well, it's concentration greatly aided by the convergence of all the main roads north at Dillsburg. The Union intelligence arm has been working overtime, and General Meade has been handed an opportunity bigger than that which faced McClellan at Frederick nearly a year before. The Confederate Army is stretched over 20 miles, from west of Carlisle to east of the Susquehanna; if he can get the Army of the Potomac through the gap at Dillsburg in force before Lee can concentrate, he will split the ANVA in two with a good chance of cutting the bulk of it off, 100 miles north of the Potomac.

Stuart has continued to bounce off of the right flank of the marching Union Army, and has finally followed Early over York Mountain and back into contact. Lee now knows the true danger of his position, and hurriedly orders Ewell to get his troops back across the river while the rest of the Army rushes to reinforce the troops holding the vital gap. Apprised of the situation, Couch endeavors to maintain contact, using Crawford's veteran troops to slow Ewell's withdrawal as much as possible.

Essentially, this scenario is very similar to the Battle of South Mountain in '62, except that the 'gap' is far wider and less defensible and the stakes, if anything, are even higher! A desperate defense/attack, coupled with wildly variable reinforcements should make for a game with quite a bit of replay value! The Union player must mount a furious attack with his arriving troops, regardless of casualties, knowing that he has a chance to strike a war-winning blow. The Confederate player must form a desperate, collapsing defense on several fronts, while trying to extricate both Ewell's troops and as many supplies as possible from his foothold on the east shore of the Susquehanna.

THE DEVIL'S TO PAY Contains: 

    1 full color 22 x 34 tactical map covering the critical gap at Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. 
    2 identical 8 1/2 x 11 Op/Maps covering the battle area, as well as the operational area surrounding it.

This game of modern warfare was played out with plastic pieces on a map made of very thin plastic. The square grid shows a horseshoe landmass with an island in the middle. Players set up on opposite ends of the horseshoe and prepare to fight it out. Results are achieved via a spinner. Pieces include aircraft carriers, battleships, smaller cruisers, delta wing jets and tanks. There are also cardboard markers showing either the Maltese cross or the British three-ringed circle.

It is played with 4 sets of 18 pieces (knights) on 8 boards (4 straight, 4 L-shaped) with 12 holes on each board. The goal is to hold three of the boards by removing the opponents' pieces from them.

Players take turns by moving one of their pieces either one hole horizontally or vertically, or jumping over their own or opponents' pieces. If an opponent's piece is found between two hostile knights or between one knight and the edge of the board, it is removed from play.

As soon as a player (or a team of 2) controls three boards (which are randomly placed - giving the game some diversity!) the game is over and the other player/s lose.

Alex Randolph: Unfortunately containing a fatal technical flaw (you might see it: the pawns tend to get stuck in the board, so when you try to move a pawn you often lift the board with it.
Moreso the small flags on the pawns break very quickly - Hermann Huth)

12064,Ranger,1991,7,1,0,2,8,1,1,Wargames,Fighting Miniatures Wargame ,Dice RollingSimulation,"Ranger is a set of miniatures rules for the French  Indian War (Seven Years War in North America).  The scale is skirmish: 1 figure = 1 man.  The game consists of a 48-page booklet - players must provide their own miniatures, terrain, dice, etc.

Ranger covers small actions in the FI war.  Rogers' Rangers, Indians, line troops, marines, militia, coureurs de bois - the rules differentiate between them all.   Rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, morale, wounds, disorganization, etc., are given.

Due to the extensive wilderness this war was fought in, there are rules for fog of war.  Each unit uses a tray - a simple board to hold the miniatures on.  But you don't put the miniatures on the trays until contact is made.  Instead, depending on the terrain, you actually use more trays than you have units!  Certain amounts of dummy trays are allotted in each scenario, and you have to scout them out to see which are real and which are not.  Even then you may not be able to tell what type of troops are on the trays until they fire at you...

Another interesting rule is the officer incident rule.  At the end of each move when in fire combat, you must roll on the officer incident table.  This is a table of 66 events - use 2d6, reading them as percentile dice.  Results range from beneficial to deleterious, from mild to instant death.  Many are humorous, such as #44: A musket ball misses the officer's head, hits the flag staff, breaking it, the finial landing on the officer's crown, knocking him out.  Light wound, unconscious for 1d6 moves.

Two scenarios are provided and advice given for creating more.  There are background notes and extensive notes on what colors to paint the miniatures.  A bibliography is also included.

12066,Habitants & Highlanders,1992,7.65,10,3,2,8,120,120,Wargames,Age of Reason Dice Fighting Miniatures Wargame ,Dice RollingPoint to Point MovementSimulation,"Subtitled The Seven Years War in North America, this game covers what those in the USA call the French and Indian War.

The 72-page booklet contains a lot of historical background, discussions of geography, tactics, uniforms, flags, and two different sets of miniatures rules, 11 detailed scenarios (with maps, starting forces setups, terrain, etc.), and a campaign game called Wolfe and Montcalm.  The latter includes not only rules, but a page of counters to photocopy and glue to cardstock as well as an 11x17 map (~A3 size) with point-to-point movement to move the counters on.

One set of miniatures rules is called Battle Scale (each figure = 50 men), and the other Skirmish Scale (1 figure = 1-5 men).  Rules are given for movement, morale, ranged fire, melee combat, Indians, Rangers, European Line troops, local militia, ambush, etc.

Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one 3 card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite.

Scenarios include both Battle Scale and Skirmish Scale settings.  Braddock's Defeat, Battle for Lake George, a raid by Rogers' Rangers, Scaling the Heights of Abraham at Quebec City, and many more, are all represented.

The campaign game can be played as a separate wargame, or used to generate Battle Scale miniatures games, as you wish.  Rules are provided for the counters if you don't wish to take the battles to the miniatures table.

All in all, a fine and informative set of rules.

12068,Once Upon a Time in the West Indies,1992,6,3,0,2,12,1,1,,Fighting Miniatures Nautical Pirates Wargame ,Dice RollingSimulation,"This game is simply a small booklet, 36 pages.  The players need to supply miniatures, terrain, dice, etc.  This game is strictly for skirmish wargaming, meaning one figure represents one person.

The game contains rules for miniatures gaming with 17th-century swashbuckling pirates and musketeers, as seen in the movies.  Rules are given for movement, ranged combat,  melee combat, morale, etc.  The most interesting rules are the cinematic rules, however.  Figures are defined as either Leading Players, Supporting Actors, Bit Parts or Extras.  A Leading Player can mow through a [b]lot[/b] of Extras without even slowing down, but combat between two characters of the same level is tense and more drawn out.

Rules are also given for two types of stunts: Deeds of Derring-Do and Dramatic Entrances.  Very entertaining!

The rules not only deal with figures, but also cover ship-to-ship combat and boarding.  The ship movement system is very simple and completely ignores the wind even though these are sailing ships.

Finally, the game provides two scenarios - Scripts, they call it, in keeping with their cinematic theme.  One scenario is for pirates and the other for musketeers.

This is a light, easy, not too detailed set of miniatures rules aimed at fun rather than historical accuracy.  It doesn't require a lot of miniatures to get started - even four figures per side makes for an entertaining game.

[Note: there is a companion volume, Once Upon a Time in the West Country, set in the English Civil War.  Similar rules system, somewhat less cinematic.]

12069,Skirmish Wargaming,1975,7.41667,12,2.5,2,12,60,60,Wargames,American West Fighting Medieval Miniatures Napoleonic Pirates ,Dice RollingSimulation,"Donald Featherstone is one of the cornerstones of modern miniatures gaming.  His first book was published in 1962 and the last one I've seen was published in 1998, but there may be later ones, too.

This game is only a book - no figures, terrain, dice, etc., are provided.  It contains his rules for skirmish miniatures gaming.  In skirmish wargaming, each figure represents one man (or woman or animal).  Consequently, they tend to represent small action warfare.

The book has a chapter of basic rules common to all the scenarios, then provides detailed scenarios (even with an entertainingly written fictional account) and special rules for the following eras:

The Vikings (850 AD)
English Archers in France (1429)
English Civil War cavalry action (1643)
Pirates in the Caribbean (1715)
The Peninsular War (1813, Napoleonic)
The French Foreign Legion in Mexico (1866)
British Colonials vs Zulus (1879)
The Old West (1888, USA)
First World War trench raid (1916)
Street fighting in Cassino (1944)

A typical battle will feature 8-12 men per side.  Team play is possible.

The basic system requires a player to issue orders to his troops, such as seize a certain objective.  It may take a few turns for the troops to get there, and in the meantime, the situation may have changed.  It takes a full turn to issue new orders, during which the troops continue towards the old objective!

Rules are given for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, wound levels, troop quality levels, morale, etc.  A record sheet is needed to keep track of these things (plus orders), but due to the small number of troops, it's not a problem.  Very fun system if you have access to miniatures and terrain.

The Spanish Civil War provides two game scenarios. In the historical scenario the Spanish Nationalists and the German/Italian support forces face off against the Spanish Republican forces and their Soviet allies along with the volunteer brigades. The Republic begins game play with more productivity, but must face a stronger Nationalist army and hold ground against it.

The second scenario allows for an alternate historical scenario. In this scenario, both Britain and France, who approved of neither the Republic or Nationalists, move to support a Portuguese invasion of Iberia. This is a 3-6 player scenario pitting three unaligned forces against each other for control of both Spain and Portugal.

Depending on the space their token lands on, players can undertake four types of actions.  They can buy an East German operation, getting it for free by impersonating as a former owner (the result of a good dice roll) or outbidding the other players in the resulting auction.  Usually, the followup action is to lay off the workers of these operations (at the expense of the industry) to increase profits.  Players can also increase profits by taking the action to grab the grants for rescuing the ecology of the ravaged industrial lands.  The last action is to negotiate with each other to manipulate the market to their benefits through threats, bargains, and bribes.  During the course of the game, cards are drawn that allow their owners to influence the effects of their actions or to affect their opponents'.

The game ends with the conclusion of the final (16th) round.  At that point, the players tally up their final assets and the one with the highest wealth wins the game.

12099,Think-It Link-It,1992,5.8,5,0,1,0,10,10,,Party Game Word Game ,Paper-and-Pencil,"The Game of Rhyme  Reason

The object of the game is to guess paired rhyming words based on the clues given on each card.  Each card gives four clues: 1) A syllable clue--for instance Think Link indicates two one-syllable words,Thinkit Linkitindicates two two-syllable words, etc. 2) A link clue--synonyms for each word in the answer are given, Enormous Toupee for Big Wig for instance. 3) A letter clue, which gives the first letter of each word in the answer. And 4) A phrase clue, Covers a bald spot for Big Wig for example.  On a player's turn, another player chooses a card and reads the syllable and link clues aloud.  If they guess the answer correctly, they score the points printed on the card (either 5 or 10--cards are double-sided with easier 5 point links printed in blue on one side and harder 10 point links printed in orange on the other.)  For each additional clue given, one point is subtracted, with the player losing a point from their score if they fail to guess it after all four clues have been given.  It is suggested in the rules that participants play to a score of 100.

This game was published in two editions: a pocket edition with 50 cards, and a deluxe edition with 500 cards.  The pocket edition also includes a small pad of paper and a pencil for keeping score.

In 2005, a new deluxe edition was released with 1000 cards, and new pocket editions: Classic, Junior, Sports, Genius, Food  Cooking, and Science, Animals  Nature.

Each horse has differing abilities and many are heavily affected by the going (as in reality). Each horse has a handicap rating and the higher the better basically. Each horse's stamina is adjusted once the going has been determined by spinning the going adjuster.

The going is important as it dictates the amount of speed points each horse gets. For example, if the going is firm all get 64; if heavy 54. The horses handicap mark is added to however many spaces a player chooses to move their horse per go of a player. So, again, the higher the handicap, the more likely you are to win.

There are times when you will land on a fence and so an appropriate card is drawn and it must be acted upon immediately. There are also horseshoe spaces that can bring good and bad luck.

More than just a dice throw and race game, each player must ensure that each of their horses has enough speed points to go two circuits around the lovely board. There are 24 hand painted horses and it all just looks nice.

In January 1945, Soviet forces were poised to bring war home to the Germans. The invasion posed a number of problems for the Soviet high command. The German defenses were organized in depth, and consisted of powerful permanent fortifications, a series of trench lines and anti-tank ditches, artillery emplacements, etc. In addition, the terrain was difficult, laced with lakes, rivers, marshes and canals.

The two attacking Soviet fronts mustered between them some 3,800 tanks and assault guns, 25,000 artillery pieces, 3,00 aircraft and 1.2 million assault troops. Opposing them were 780,000 Germans, with 8,200 cannon, 700 to 800 tanks, and about 775 planes. Bolstering the defense were such elite units as the Hermann Goering and Gross Deutschland Divisions. With the Germans fighting on their own soil, and the Soviets determined to deliver the death blow to the Third Reich, the scene was set for what became the most bitter fighting since Stalingrad.

The first two rounds are public knowledge: if asked, you must tell how you voted on a given item.  The third round is secret, however.

After three rounds, count up the votes for each character for each item.  There are tie-breaking rules.  High score wins.

During the game you can make deals and break them - this will be no surprise if you've read the comics.  You must record your votes in ink, though!

12146,Gonnect,2000,7.16429,28,3.8571,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area EnclosurePattern Building,"From Wikipedia:

Gonnect is a strategy board game for two players invented by Joo Pedro Neto in 2000.

The game is played with standard go equipment (though 13x13 boards are often preferred to 19x19) and all the rules of Go apply, except that players can't pass and the pie rule is used to determine who goes first.

The goal of the game is as in Hex: to construct a group that connects any two opposite sides. A player can also win if his opponent has no legal moves (since suicides and passes are illegal).

Games between skilled players will end up temporarily deadlocked, since the square Go board allows a four corners configuration where neither side can strongly connect. However, since players can't pass, they eventually must start filling in the internal liberties of their groups. The player who has made the smallest amount of territory will presumably get killed first, so building more territory than your opponent is a secondary (but extremely common) means of forcing a connection and the win.

So, a gonnect game between similarly skilled opponents unfolds in two stages:


     The board-filling stage where opponents race to connect sides until the position is deadlocked.
     The eye-filling stage where opponents must fill in their own eye space or destroy their opponents. 


Although it shares many of the same tactics as go, some players feel that gonnect has a more interesting opening and endgame than Go. Most Go players, however, feel that the eye-filling stage of Gonnect is tedious, and that the game lacks the simple elegance of Go.

If a player lands on a space with a state's name on it, the player may pay the price to add that state's votes to one's score.

It's a simple game of two teams of pirates on a Caribbean island trying to get to the X marks the spot treasure before the other.

You have 100 points, which must cover two categories: speed and combat ability for all ten pirates.  Minimum number of points in a given category is 1, maximum is 10 - otherwise, you're free to spend them as you wish.  You can make a few mega pirates with high speed and combat and hope your shlumpfs can dig up the treasure while their superior comrades hold off the enemy.  Or you can make them all equal - your choice.

There are a couple of charts for combat, including a ranged combat table and a penalty to your defense table, based on how far you moved that turn.

12153,Alak,1984,4.96667,15,1.5,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area Enclosure,"A one-dimensional (played on a line) variation of Go that was first described by A.K. Dewdney in his book The_Planiverse. In 2001, Alan Baljeu modified the game into its present form.

The rules (from Wikipedia):


     Black and white take turns placing stones on the line. Unlike Go, this placement is compulsory if a move is available; if no move is possible, the game is over.
     No stone may be placed in a location occupied by another stone, or in a location where a stone of your own colour has just been removed. The latter condition keeps the game from entering a neverending loop of stone placement and capture, known in Go as ko.
     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of enemy stones to no longer have any adjacent empty spaces--liberties, as in Go--then those stones are removed. As the above rule states, the opponent may not play in those locations on their following turn.
     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of your own colour to no longer have any liberties, the stones are not suicided, but instead are safe and not removed from play.


Play continues until a player cannot place a stone on their turn. At this point, the number of stones on the board is counted; the winner is the one with the most stones.

Each team's lineup consists of an identical selection of 9 batters falling into one of five broad categories: high average, low power, extra speed; high average, high power; decent average, decent power; low average, low power; and (optional) pitcher.  There's also a selection of pinch hitters, one from each category (except pitcher), and a pinch runner.

The player on defense starts the action by rolling a pair of dice; if the total is between 2 and 5, it's a 'hittable' strike (the lower the number, the easier it is to hit); 6 or 8 (except 4-4) are foul strikes; 7 is an unhittable strike; 8 (4-4 only), 9, and 10 are hittable balls; and 11 and 12 are unhittable balls.  If it's a hittable pitch, the offensive player decides whether to swing; if they do, they roll the pair of dice, and consult a chart to determine the results.  Base runners can attempts steals and (sometimes) advancing an extra base on a hit; the defensive player can call pitch-outs if a runner is on base; and the batter can be made to hit-and-run, sacrifice bunt, or even suicide squeeze.  The usual rules of baseball apply (3 outs to an inning, 9 innings to a game, etc.).

Background Information:
The BAPS booklet is 75 spiral-bound pages with a card-stock cover and two, letter-sized chart cards, one for infantry actions and one for vehicles and artillery.

In designing BAPS, I designed and threw away at least two complete rules systems. The result is something I am proud of -- except the title. Some day I will come up with a title that implies both infantry and armored skirmishes.

Period covered:
The rules were designed for WWI to the present; however, they work equally well for any smokeless powder era, including the Spanish Civil War, Mexican Punitive Expedition, Spanish-American War, and Philippine Insurrection. The primary focus is WWII, and most of the order of battle information, vehicle data charts, and scenarios are aimed at this period.

Games can last as short or long as you want, and time limit rules keep the game moving fast. Agree on a friendly hour long game or play a marathon session until one of you is in the poor-house.

This are closely related to the later Signal Close Action, Fast Play, but trade complexity/depth for speed.

Signal Close Action has been designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set. In the Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable. His possible courses of action were governed by the technology of the time, the wind, weather, ships condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships companies.

Fundamental to the rules is the Ability Chart which requires only 1 throw of dice and governs the core game (except Weather) as well as other options. Note:
When for example movement section is referred to in the rules, this relates to the movement section of the Ability Chart.

---

Taken from the 4th edition (2005), is the description for Signal Close Action by Mr. Rod Langton.

This new edition of Signal Close Action is very timely, this being the year of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar.  It inspired me to produce, not just an update of previous editions, but an enhanced game, smoother, with more fluid movement and ability for vessels.

Signal Close Action was designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set.  In Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable.  His possible courses of action were governed by the 'technology' of the time, the win, weather, ship's condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships' companies.

For those who re very new to Napoleonic naval wargaming, you might find my Fast Play set a good introduction.  Even after you progress to a full comprehensive game, your Fast Play will still be very useful for club games and introducing others to the hobby.

Experienced Signal Close Action players will want to know 'what's new' in Fourth Edition.  Well, the concept of the Ability Chart is still fundamental to the rules - particularly as it cuts down on the need for excessive record keeping.  This time however, there are more dice and they play critical roles.  In the past, if you had a 'bad [dice] throw' then ll your actions were affected.  With Fourth Edition, the dice are color coded, with one being 'common' to all.  The score of this Common dice [die] is added to the dice [die] relating to the various actions.

Other new innovations include the division of a player's part of Turn into two segments and reloading, so that the time scale of actions are more realistic.  The actual Firing rules are not changed noticeably but there are new separate charts for firing at unrated vessels.

The game can support more then six players by dividing the group into two teams.  One team will attempt to guess the correct answer while the other team attempts to mislead them by giving believable definitions.
As in Balderdash, one player (the TRUTHTELLER) gives the actual definition while the remaining members of the team (the BLUFFERs) give made up definitions.

By the creators of Tangoes

Contains two decks of cards in a plastic case (VHS-like, but smaller). Provides 216 word puzzles and solutions. Can be played solo as a puzzle, or with groups (parties, travel -- Word Trek makes a family trip fun!).

From the publisher's website:

A Word Trek Puzzle is a pair of words with the same number of letters (For Example: dog / cat). The objective is to transform one word into another word, through step-by-step transformations. Using paper and pencil, players either change or rearrange (anagramming) one letter from the first word to make another valid word. (For Example: dog, dot, cot, cat.) WORD TREK develops logical thinking while building vocabulary and improving spelling skills.

12246,"Up Against The Wall, Mother****er!",1969,4.28571,7,1,2,2,90,90,Wargames,Political Wargame ,Area Movement,"Components:  12 markers and 24 small cards, to be mounted by the players
Map:  1 double newspaper page with a cartoon representation of the Columbia campus
Scales:  abstract

Sorry, but that is the title.

This game took as its subject the student demonstrations at Columbia University and was originally published in the 11 March 1969 number of the Connection, a supplement to the Columbia Daily Spectator, near the date of the first anniversary of the riots.  Jim Dunnigan, then aged 25 and described in the game's designer's notes as a history major in the School of General Studies, had already designed 1914 and was at the time working on Origins of World War II, but was asked to take time out to work on this design.

The game is for two players, Radicals and Administration.  The map features eleven tracks for each of the political subgroups in the game (e.g. Black Students, Moderate Strikers, Alumni, Harlem Community).  The objective for the players is to have the most influence, determined by the positions of markers on these tracks, for their side by the end of the twelfth turn.  During a turn, players deploy abstracted units representing their political leverage onto the tracks to 'attack' the other player's units (as tokens, Dunnigan suggests small pieces of paper colored red or marijuana seeds for the Radicals, and blue bits of paper or capsules of Seconal for the Administration) and so move the markers towards their 'end' of the tracks.  The 24 Contingency Cards add some randomness by taking or giving units of wherewithal to one player or another.

SPI sold photocopies of this game supplement for a couple of years after its start.  They are hard to find now and command a high price.

Overall the theme is presented quite well with the only glaring problems being the Jail, Free Parking, and Go To Jail spaces.  The publishers should have gone the extra step to stick with the theme.  Penalty Box, Bye Week, and a Referee square would fit in nicely.  At least the Chance and Community Chest cards were replaced with Hockey Stick and Puck cards.

The bits are comparable to the standard game with minor coloration differences.  There are a few property cards such as the 3 goals in 21 seconds card that could benefit with a factoid explaining its significance.  However, I suppose if you went out of your way to buy this edition you already know the details.  (Bill Mosienko, '52 Blackhawks, BTW)

As the machine rotates, the cards that are loaded spin and are slowly revealed.  When a player thinks that they can use a card that is in the machine, they press the switch in front of them to stop the tower.  They then have to take the card that is in front of them and use it with any number of the six cards in their hand to make a word.  Points are scored based on the number of letters used in the word.  Players play to an arbitrary point total.

Like a number of Ideal games, this game is based around a contraption.  The cards have letters that are formatted to be difficult to discern when only partly revealed.

In Radmhle (Wheel Mill), players try to form a row of three tokens including the central space. The purpose of the game is to form a line of three with one's pieces. A row of three tokens on the wheel is not considered a mill. The pieces are moved along the diagonal or the circumference to the next free intersection. A leap over one other piece is permitted. Very tactical game that might go on forever. Usually ends after one players makes a crucial mistake of letting the other build a situation with two possible winning moves.

Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) published a total of twelve issues of Little Wars magazine from 1976 to 1978 before folding it into The Dragon.

Components

1 11x17 area map of China and Southeast Asia
160 uncut, unmounted counters
4 pages of rules
1 page of game historical background

Counter Manifest

50 red (Communist Chinese) counters: 2 4-strength armies, 2 2-strength armies, 19 1-strength armies, 24 control markers, 1 Mao marker, 2 blanks

49 blue (Nationalist Chinese) counters: 1 4-strength army, 2 2-strength armies, 18 1-strength armies, 1 air force marker, 24 control markers, 1 Chiang marker, 2 blanks

4 green (British) counters: 4 1-strength armies

1 turn marker

What the designer says : Long March is a game for three players (there is a two player scenario) about the struggle for control of China during and immediately following World War II. It is 1942, Japan is at the height of her expansion into Southeast Asia and the Pacific, yet China stands defiantly unconquerable. As the Japanese player, you must carefully pit the Chinese factions against each other while using your superior military machine to bring all of China under your control. As the Nationalist Chinese player, you must cooperate with the Communists (however distasteful that may seem) to drive the invading Japanese from the shores of China before re-establishing your authority as the only central government of China. As the Chinese Communist player, you too are faced with an enemy worse than fellow Chinese. You must first drive the Japanese from China before you can put your superior guerrilla tactics to work against the corrupt Kuomintang.

Players Value: This is a simple game with undemanding rules (movement two areas per turn, roll dice in simultaneous rounds of combat, each 1 is an elimination and each 6 is a retreat, minor variations on this for leaders, air forces, etc.). It hustles right along at six months per turn, with a variable exit point for the Japanese. The game is unusual in that it is designed primarily for three players, any one of which has a good shot at winning the game (if the Japanese player wins, the two Chinese players can play a Civil War endgame to see who comes in second).

The game has a unique movement system where movement is determined by by making lines of tyres/stop watches/fuel/spanners on a 3*3 grid, by placing cards from your hand. The more identical symbols in the line you make, the faster you can go. Blocking on corners and single lane roads can also be used to your advantage. Quite a unique system.

Players are dealt a number of letter chips. A random letter is placed on the first lightning field. Now players simultaneously try to find a word with that letter and a letter chip of their choice from their pile of chips.

It does not matter where the two letters are located in the new word, but the two letters have to be in the sequence displayed on the board.

For example the first letter chip is A. Player1 has a N chip, so he shouts ANd and places the N on the Blitz board on the field next to the A. Now the players just have to find a new word with N and a letter of their choice from their chip piles. Player2 has a E and shouts liNE. he places the E chip on the next field.

Game ends when a letter chip is placed on the last field on the blitz board. Player with the smallest number of chips left wins.

12284,Crash Cribbage,1999,5.5,2,0,2,6,30,30,,Card Game Racing ,Hand ManagementSet Collection,"Cribbage played upon one track with a figure 8 design.  All players start in the start holes and choose the direction they wish to peg.  You may end up pegging the same direction or in the opposite direction of the other players.

The real excitement starts when you finish your pegging on another player's peg (AKA crash another player's peg).  If you hit your opponent's tail peg you will send it forward one past the the same color lead peg, if you hit your opponent's head peg you will send it backward one past the rear peg. And if that displaced peg happens to end up in another peg's hole, another crash occurs... This greatly enhances the strategy involved in the pegging phase of the game.

The card play is exactly the same as traditional cribbage and the track is exactly 121 holes.

On the back of the Crash Cribbage board, a regular cribbage board is found.

12294,Game of Boom or Bust,1951,5.88889,9,3,3,4,60,60,,Economic Negotiation ,Auction/BiddingRoll / Spin and MoveTrading,"HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED: Players move around the Board according to the throw of Dice. Properties such as Beauty Parlor, Department Store, etc., are bought and sold at prices that rise and fall quite unexpectedly depending on whether the conditions are NORMAL, BOOM times, or BUST (depression times). The game is quick moving and amusing. The game ends when all but one player becomes bankrupt and this surviving player WINS THE GAME. If the players prefer, a time limit may be set at the end of which time the player owning the greatest amount of property and cash (when added together) WINS THE GAME.

The Board has 16 properties (4/side) with purchase price and rent printed on the inside of each space. The Board has NORMAL prices printed thereon. A removable panel, which fits over two pegs in the center of the board, has BOOM prices and rents on the obverse and BUST prices and rents on the reverse. The game starts in NORMAL cycle, changes to BOOM cycle, then to BUST cycle, then back to NORMAL, etc., when any player lands on any of the three corner spaces marked with a Star. (The fourth corner is Start Here.) Players try to increase their worth by buying properties at BUST or NORMAL prices, and selling properties at BOOM prices, while trying to bankrupt their opponents by collecting rents, the highest of which is $250,000. The standard rule concerning landing on Un-owned Property is buy it or leave it. There is an AUCTION option in the Rules, similar to the Auction Rule in Monopoly.
This game plays like a simplified version of its more famous stable mate, Monopoly, but with the unique twist that all properties' values increase or decrease at the same time, sometimes in rapid succession, without having to develop the properties or have groups or sets.

The raised playing field (Board) actually sits in the 15x15x2 box bottom (it is not designed to stand alone). It has a slot on the outside of each property space, wherein the owner places his/her like-colored T-card vertically to show ownership. The bills, which are the size of older Monopoly games, come in denominations of $100, $1000, and $10,000. There are also blue/white discs worth $5,000 and silver/blue discs worth $50,000. Four painted wooden markers (red, blue, green, yellow) and two white dice complete the equipment. The Rules sheet states Questions on the rules for BOOM OR BUST will be answered gladly if 3-cent stamp is enclosed.

12298,Privilege,1938,0,0,0,1,4,60,60,,Card Game ,PartnershipsTrick-taking,"Privilege is a trick-taking game featuring a 5-suited deck with 2 unsuited trumps.  Players play in fixed partnerships and bid for how many over-tricks they believe they will take.  The partnership making the high bid may be challenged by the others, who can potentially double or treble their score, but can re-challenge (fight to the finish) for quadruple points (all of these have large negative consequences if one loses).

The trick play is more or less standard, with two exceptions.  One is the pair of unsuited trumps, which rank below the top four cards of the trump suit.  The other is that the five suits are grouped into a pair and a triplet, and the suits in each set can be played for each other at times (the rules are a bit confusing here).

Scoring is reminiscent of bridge, with points earned above and below the line.

While the main game is for exactly four players, a solitaire game is included.

Probably the main point of interest is the game's 1930s Socialist flavor.  The good suits are Scientists, Idealists, and Judges, with the bad ones Bankers and Advertisers.  The cards are individually named, some for people and some for methods and tools (Radio, Logic, etc.).  The unsuited trumps are Honesty and Kindness.

Also of interest are the card illustrations.  Some were done by the designer, but the others by well-known American artists of the period - Rockwell Kent, Peggy Bacon, William Gropper, and George Schreiber (other cards were by Esther Vance, who appears to not have attracted much attention in the art world).

Sky My Husband is a collaborative effort from Guillaume Blossier and Jean-Loup Chiflet. A while back, Guillaume showed us a prototype of a game in which players had to find English expressions through their literal French translations - averaging about two clues per phrase. This idea, highly innovative in terms of a game, went over very well in tests. We were reminded of the book Sky my Husband, which was based on a similar idea (it included literal French translations of English phrases) - and sold over 200,000 copies over the last 10 years. It seemed logical to us, then, to contact the book's author, Jean-Loup Chiflet. He was excited by the concept and helped us out greatly with the content, as well as getting permission from the book's publisher to use the same title.

In the game, 460 expressions, each with two clues, are read out by a player. The object of the game is to deduce the original English phrase the fastest. As an example, one English phrase is Tie-break. The literal French translation Repos de cravate (Resting tie) is provided, along with two clues: Tennis and Deciding Game.

Each fish requires its own kind of bait, so it's not as easy as it looks  not to mention that sharks can also take the bait! The weather might get worse, and you might run out of fuel or bait, so look to your fellow fishermen to ensure that together you can get those fish to market.

On a turn in Archipel, you navigate between the islands. If you're at a harbor, you can get fresh bait, fuel and other equipment, and you can also have a look at the weather. Weather tokens are placed on the game board, making sailing more difficult between storms. Fish are placed face down on the game board. To try to catch one, you flip it over to reveal it, but you must have the right bait on board. You'll possibly then need to sell the fish at market immediately as your boat can hold only so much fuel.

If all the villages are fed and all players return home, then the day was a success and they've won; if no more fish can be delivered, however, they'll have to try again another day.

12329,Voyage to Cipangu,1979,6.54545,11,2.25,2,4,45,45,,Adventure Exploration Fantasy Medieval Pirates ,Modular BoardPick-up and DeliverTile Placement,"Cipangu (pronounced Chi-pon-gu) is the name given to the island of Japan by Marco Polo in his journals.
  As the introduction on the rules sheet quotes, Marco Polo described Cipangu as a land ...abounding in gold and producing vast quantities of the largest and finest pearls, together with a variety of precious stones, so that, in fact, it abounds in riches.

Each player is sending their sailing ship out into the uncharted ocean in an attempt to find the riches of Cipangu, and other smaller islands, and return them to their home port. These riches are represented in the game by shiny gold counters which look very much like wide, flat gold bars. Only gold returned to one's port counts for victory.

The sailing ship's hulls are printed on cardboard sheets, to be punched out and folded into shape. Three wooden dowel masts are inserted through punched-out, printed paper sails and then through the decks of the ships.

The board is a blank diagonal grid of 32 square ocean spaces with the four players' home ports in the corners. The 29 Sea Square tiles are shuffled and 32 of them placed face down on the spaces. There are four each of Island, Reef, Ship and Monster tiles plus the Cipangu tile, a Fog tile, and a Storm tile. All others are open sea.

There are four Encounter Decks, cards from which are drawn when a ship discovers Islands, Reefs, Ships, and Monsters. The monsters are the only fantasy element of the game. Their artwork is drawn in the style of the Here There Be Monsters of the old mapmakers. Each deck has cards with good or bad results: gold bars, extra sailors, repairs, attacks by monsters or pirates, grounding on reefs, being attacked or helped by island natives, etc.

Each ship starts with three sailors and three masts. The markers for the sailors are actually the familiar plastic push-pins available in any dollar store, without the pin. Both sailors and masts serve as 'hit-point' indicators: any ship that loses all masts or all sailors is sunk. Movement range is determined by current no. of masts to a maximum of 3 spaces.

There is a wind direction spinner which is a 'top' made up of an octagonal direction card with a wood dowel through the center. This is spun to determine which direction a player's ship cannot sail that turn.

Players move around the board, turning over the sea tiles and trying to accumulate gold and survive the various events that can damage their ship. When the one Cipangu tile is discovered, players can get 3 gold bars each turn they stay there.

Players can also 'Turn Pirate' by attacking another player's ship or port. 1d6's are rolled and compared, low roller in each round loses one sailor, ties cause both ships to lose a mast. Ships that lose all sailors are plundered of their gold and sunk. Ships that lose all masts just sink.
  Combat against ports is handled the same way except ports have no masts. Players can leave extra sailors in port as defense forces. Sunk ships are replaced, and damaged ships repaired, by paying one gold bar and continuing with a new/fixed 3-mast, 3-sailor ship from your port.

Once the last Sea Tile is turned over, the game ends and Gold Bars are counted up to determine a victor.

There are 5 food groups (suits): Fruit, Vegetable, Entree, Beverage and Dessert

You'll get a better bonus the earlier you can play (meld) a full meal, either on yourself or someone else. You can exchange good and bad foods between your hand and meals on the table to improve your score and decrease the score of your opponents. You can also eat one item at a time to protect it from getting taken by someone else.

Each player fearlessly but cautiously transcends from his or her home row to their Quintagon. However, the greatest sense of accomplishment and overall objective of the game is to block your opponent's path to their Quintagon while insuring that your progress is not impeded.

Bar none, the most intriguing component of Quintagon is the Determinizer. When turned topside down and shaken rhythmically and vigorously and then turned topside up, the marbles inside of this colorful translucent cylinder assembly creates harmony and delights emotions. Once the shaking ceases, the marbles descend into the middle of the Determinizer so that each player can be directed in the pattern and sequence of movement.

The events contain nice stories but all amount to miss a go or swap a card with someone else style results. You stand a 2 in 3 chance of drawing a new part card, in which case you have to add it to your growing machine and discard one you don't need.

The machine itself is built much like dominoes. Each card has some fancy gizmo of some sort on it and enters or exits with either:

a start symbol
an end symbol
a chain (yellow)
a block and tackle (orange)
a water pipe (purple)
a conduit (red)

DB was designed by Gary Graber, the designer of both Jellicoe vs Scheer and Escape of the Goeben that appeared in Panzerschrek magazine.  DB combines the ships and rules that appeared in these two games, and has added 147 new ships, new optional rules, new scenarios, and 25 blank ship counters to give gamers a comprehensive package covering the fleets of 17 nations from around the world.  A brand new class of ship--the light cruiser--makes its debut in 
DB.  Over 40 CL are included, along with new optional rules for their use.   Besides these light cruisers, additional ships from Argentina, Australia, Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany,Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, and the United States are included in DB.
 What's Included:  24 page rulebook, ten 8.5x11 cardstock counter sheets (345 ships plus 25 blanks), game markers and templates, and a small color sheet of counters.  DB components must be mounted and cut apart prior to play. New optional rules include Light Cruisers, Modified CA Gun Range, Rough Sea option, Battlecruiser Vulnerability rule, Low Ammunition rule, and a new optional method for determining victory
points.  The optional rules originally given in the Jellicoe/Goeben Supplement (Panzerschreck #10) are included, plus new optional rules covering Light Cruisers, Modified CA Gun Ranges, Rough Sea, Battlecruiser Vulnerability, Simultaneous Movement, Low Ammunition, and a new way to calculate Victory Points, and more.  Scenarios (18 in all) include Jutland, Dogger Bank, three North Sea scenarios  Goeben vs Battlecrusiers, Escape of the Goeben, Black Sea/Adriatic/Baltic Sea scenarios, Last Sortie of the German Fleet, and several Free Form and Introductory scenarios.  The possibility of design your own situations are almost limitless.
    
To quote the Designer's Notes, Dreadnoughts  Battlecruisers is a simple, introductory game of World War I battleship combat.  It does not aim to be the last word in Great War naval simulation; it does aim to be a fun, accessible, and competitive first word on the subject.

BattleBots is a game in which each player controls a 'Bot in a futuristic arena.  In the basic game, players are familiarized with the Arena rules, which stress fairness among participants.  Once players have a good grasp of the game mechanics, they can move onto the Optional Rulers [sic] for a more challenging game.

BattleBots consists of two parts, construction and team play.  During construction, players design their own 'Bots based upon the scenario being played.  After the players have recorded their 'Bots on 'Bot sheets, they are ready to enter the arena.

This is a very small game--it came in a CD jewel case.  The components consist of small stand-up counters representing the BattleBots, an arena, and log sheets for the characteristics of one's BattleBot.  More information was (and perhaps one day will be again) available at the publisher's website, www.snarlingbadger.com.

One of the four will have the luck of the dice to help them be the first to bring home all the goods on their list.

Modern times have arrived for children from 4 years. The animals living in the village have ordered their shopping and are waiting for their deliveries from up to four distributors from the town. The deliveries should come quickly with their lorries.
Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to find your way through the village. Take care not to lose your way - otherwise the pizza will be cold and the milk sour when you finally find your customers house.
Sometimes the distributors are distracted by the wonderful things on sale at the bakery and take long breaks instead of delivering their goods.
With the help of Mrs Piggy, the dice and a good memory though, the distributors will find their way to deliver the goods to the waiting customers.

The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are pie spaces, and from these there are spokes of track leading to the middle of the board.

Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.

Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.

The directions read: In asking a question, place the Question Card so that it will fit exactly over this Disc, placing the question asked at the top, so that the dot on the edge will be directly opposite the dot on the top of this Disc, when the hand will immediately move in a quizzical manner, and in a few moments stop, and give the correct answer.

The game is played like backgammon, except that the goal is to be the first to bear off your own captain, which starts on top of the 24 point. If the captain is unprotected (either a blot or on top of a point, no matter how many men are below), it may be moved backwards if your opponent throws a swirl. If the opposing captain is not in its inner table when you score a gammon, it counts as a backgammon instead.

la chasse-galerie) involves transporting explorers, lumbermen, and trappers from the wilderness to their homes to see their sweethearts.

The game uses this legend as a unique mechanic. Players fill their canoes with wares to trade to Indians in the territories for fur. When they are ready, or their canoe is full, they travel to a fort or a town to sell their furs at the current price. Because of the hazards involved in wilderness travel, it can behoove the explorer to fly the canoe back home. Flying is not without its perils, though, as the canoe may tip and the canoe's contents be lost.

This game involves action points (you have three to do with as you choose), smart card play (cards determine movement, crew, and other special abilities), and smart trading (what goods do I take to trade to the Indians?).

This fun, interactive board game teaches children ages 9 to 13 how having financial goals helps families make smart money choices and live quality lives.  Pick a character; choose a path.  What sharing, saving and spending choices will you make to reach your character's goal? Roll the die and see where the money choices you make lead you.

Ostensibly, this game seeks to teach children the pros and cons of different spending profiles.  Players choose a character mat featuring one of the characters, including Craig Cautious, Mike Mega Purchase, Wella D'Versified, Livva Below Means, Minnie Miserly, Charlie Givva, Sandy Status Quo, and Sammy Spend-a-Lot.  Each character has a salary, a cash goal, and varying goals in four categories: Necessities, Save, Share, and Spend.

Players choose a path on the board among Share, Save, or Spend, and move a pawn down that path collecting a card from the appropriate stack on every move.  Each card has actions for the player to carry out, such as You received interest on your savings -- Receive $50 for each {Savings Token} you have.  Players can change paths when they reach a corner or when they reach a transition bridge space.  In addition to the decks for Save, Share, and Spend, there is a Wild deck that players draw from when they land on a Wild space; Wild actions are a bit random and are to simulate the ups and downs of life.

At the end of the game there is a guided section for parents to discuss the game aspects with their children, on topics such as: the importance of sharing, the value of saving, the value of investing, and further opportunities to engage children in learning about successful money management.

I'm not certain where to begin describing this one, so let me give an overview and a look at the components.

The game board is styled after the traditional Monopoly board as a square with properties down each of the sides and special areas on the corners--in this case the corners are *J.C. Nichols Parkway* Start , Tax Audit Pay, Stock Market: Collect, and *Uninsurable Loss*.  Unlike the traditional Monopoly board, there are no squares that are not properties (e.g. no Chance, Community Chest) Additionally, the properties are not grouped in colors.  All of the properties are representative of Plaza businesses at the time of printing.

The six player pieces are small, colored, enameled, metal, horse-drawn carriages, like the type that they use for carriage rides down on The Plaza.  Additionally, there is money in denominations of $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000.  There is a spinner with the numbers 1,000 to 12,000.  There is also a deck of action cards with various things like Option to buy  - spin dial, pay  amount on dial, Stock Market Falls - Pay $10,000 to bank, don't move, resume play, and the enigmatic Two Spaces.

...and that's it; no instructions, no dice, no property deeds or property values.  I'm stumped as to whether this was actually a game, or if this was a game prototype that never made it to fruition.  The cardboard insert inside the box has no markings on it, there is nothing on the inside of the lid, and the box itself is completely blank and made to look like a nice leather briefcase (albeit made of cardboard) and has no information on it, not even the game's name--the name only appears on the board. If anyone knows anything about this game, please add information because I'm at a loss.

Any word whose root she can alter by appending to it or changing one letter, any letter she uses in her word, and any crossed words tweaked (you're allowed to change one extra letter in one of the two crossed words), convert to her color by flipping over.  If you can't end your turn with more letters in your color than in your opponent's, you lose the game, simple as that.

12517,Domicolor,1974,4.11111,9,1,2,8,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Tile Placement,"Domino variant with colors and special tiles.

Aim of the game
Scoring as low as possible by getting rid of tiles with high values.

The tiles
The game consists of 70 cardboard tiles with an unusual shape: 3 colored hexagons are arranged around a central hexagon that has a number printed on it. There are 8 different colours, and each colour is assigned a value from 1 to 8. The number printed on the central hexagon is the sum of the values of the three coloured hexagons on that tile (e.g. a blue-blue-red tile would have a value of 11 as blue = 4 and red = 3).

Game play
The tiles are shuffled and each player is randomly dealt 7 tiles, which he/she puts in front of him/herself face up. The remaining tiles form the draw pile. Players take turns adding one of their tiles to previously laid tiles. Tiles always have to match in two colours, and the new tile has to be laid so that it touches only the edges of the previously laid tile. Players must not fit tiles into each other, there must always be a hexagonal gap between two tiles. A player who cannot add a matching tile continues to draw tiles from the draw pile and adds them to his/her tiles until he/she finds a matching one.

A round ends when a player has gotten rid of all his/her tiles. Each of the other players sums up the point values of their remaining tiles and scores are written down. After a previously agreed upon number of rounds, the player with the lowest score wins the game.

- 25 white pegs
- 25 black pegs
- 37 discs (white on one side, black on the other)

Hexagonal board, players take turns to place pegs at the vertices of the hexagons, and by doing so, gain influence over the surrounding hexagons.  The player with the most pegs surrounding a hexagon has temporary ownership, denoted by putting a disc in the hexagon (in the case of a draw, ownership remains unchanged).  Once a player gets half the vertices around a hexagon, they get permanent control, denoted by putting a peg in the disc.

Once all hexagons are permanently controlled, the game ends, and the player with the most pegs wins.

Clearly biased in favor of the first player, but rather nice nonetheless.

Each player belongs to one of these two camps, and controls one (or, with low player counts, several) pawns of that color. A random scenario card defines the objective of the game. There are open scenarions where each group knows what's at stake; and hidden scenarios, where only one party knows the objective, but the other group has to stop them.

Depending on the scenario, there are some devices available: Cars that increase movement (but can't enter buildings or parks); barricades that block roads or access to buildings; and explosives that can be used to block spaces or remove barricades. There are also chance cards that either call a random event, or represent an utility that can be kept for later use.

The two groups act in alternating order. Three dice are rolled for movement points that are assigned to pawns (the decision is made as group). On the target space, the pawn may pick up a chance card, collect a device, use a device, seize an opposing pawn, or even free an arrested member of the own group. Depending on the scenario, there might be additional actions available.

Play continues until one of the sides fulfill their objective, or until they are no longer able to reach it.

Example of objectives: Blow up the red head quarter; arrest a number of neutral pawns (or, for the other side, escort them to the train station); escort a state guest to several locations (or make it impossible to reach these locations).

Two rival elephantine tribes, each controlled by a player, decide to dump the stone onto their rival's territory and make it their concern instead.

The players are free to move their pieces around on the board, even into squares with their own pieces or opponent's.  They take control of the Drumlin when their piece moves onto it.  In a square with several pieces, the player with a majority of pieces takes control.  The player in control can then pass the Drumlin to another square, depending on the formation of his or her pieces.  The passing elephant then turns into a dragon, which cannot pass or catch the Drumlin.

The first player to pass the Drumlin onto his or her opponent's edge of the board wins the game.

12574,Images,1989,6.25,14,1.3333,0,0,0,0,,Party Game ,Line DrawingPartnerships,"A drawing and guessing game similar to Pictionary.

Goal
Being the first to reach the finish space with your pawn by drawing and guessing well.

Game play
The board shows two different courses to choose from. Each course consists of differently coloured spaces; some also have symbols printed on them. The cards contain words from 6 different categories, each category corresponding to a colour on the board.

Players take turns drawing an item from the category their pawn is currently on. All the other players try to guess what he/she is drawing. If the word is correctly guessed before either of the two sand timers runs out, both the drawer and the person who guessed correctly move their pawn two spaces. If the correct guess takes more time and the first timer has already run out, they both get to move one space.

While the active player is not allowed to speak, he/she may use a little chart printed in one of the corners of the board to mark how close the guesses are (smiling, neutral and unhappy smilie) or if a part of the word is missing (something is missing at the beginning/end of the word).

Special spaces allow players to challenge other players, and on x2 spaces you get double the points.

The player whose pawn reaches the finish space first wins the game.

When I set about designing the rules, I had several ideas in mind. One was to provide a highly interactive game. The second was a degree of realism, not so much the detail of weapons, but more of the reactions and abilities of scared men led by a few less visibly scared. Lastly, it was to also take absolute control away from the player and provide uncertainty, have the men not always perform as well as desired.

12587,Momox,1972,5.7,10,1,2,4,45,45,,Deduction ,,"Each player gets a pawn and numbered game tokens of the same color. The pawn is placed on the corner starting space of the matching color, and the number tokens are placed on their corresponding spaces near the players start space. Six yellow tokensnumbered 1 to 6are shuffled and placed face-down on the black circles in the middle of the board. All but the middle one are then covered with caps.

 Object:  Players try to collect the numbered tokens of their own color and to assemble them into the highest possible number (i.e., 4321). As the first token is collected, it the must be placed on the ones column, the second on the tens, the third on the hundreds, and the last on the thousands column.

 Play:  Chose a start player and play clockwise. The active player takes one cap of his choice and places it over the one yellow token that lies free (for the first player, this will be the one in the middle of the board). The number token just freed is turned face up (if not already face-up). The number on it determines how many spaces the player moves his pawn. If he lands on a yellow space, he repeats the procedure (i.e., transfer a cap, reveal a number, move pawn). If he does not land on a yellow space, his turn ends and it is the next player's turn.

Obviously, a player who remembers which number is under which cap may plan his moves accordingly. He cannot, however, use the same movement number in two successive moves because the cap must always be placed on the free token. If a player lands on a yellow space three times in succession, he reshuffles the yellow tokens, places them face down, and covers them as was done at the start of the game.

 Winning:  The first player to complete a 4-digit number wins and ends the game. If additional rounds are played, a running tally should be kept of each players numbers, which are totaled at the end of the game. The player with the highest total is the overall winner.

Following the discovery of Confederate Special Order No. 191, which outlined the disposition of General Robert E. Lee's entire army across the countryside, Union commander Gen. George McClellan moved to catch the Rebel Army while it was so dispersed. At South Mountain, the Federal First and Ninth Corps tangled with an assorted Confederate force under D.H. Hill, who fought the battle of his life. Could he hold the Yankees at bay and buy enough time for Lee to pull his scattered army back together?

Thunder on South Mountain is a tactical, brigade-level simulation of low complexity with an emphasis on command and control. A unique army posture matrix determines the sequence of play each turn, and leader effectiveness is governed by a combination of momentum, luck, and resource management.

Based on the Fire in Mississippi system, the game adds several new features such as long-range artillery fire and target disruption, line of sight, corps leaders, and variable reinforcement times.

Thunder on South Mountain is of high DTP (Desktop Publishing) quality with an 11x17 color map, 140 two-sided, color counters (that must be mounted and cut apart), a rules booklet, and player charts and cards.

event in Chechyna.  The game has four scenarios which range from the historical, to Chechan first strikes and a larger Russian Civil War.  In addition, a random events chart covers everything from Chechan terrorism to Russian anti-war protests and UN ceasefires.

The game ends either in a UN ceasefire, on turn 10 or 15.   Victory is decided on the basis of accumulated political points which are gathered by each side depending on game actions.  In addition, the Russian gains big points for holding Grozny and surrounding towns and oil fields.   The Russian can hardly be denied a military victory.  In other words, the Russian has enough
troops to literally carpet Chechyna, but the political cost of such an approach would lose him the game.

In true Joe Miranda fashion, the political point chart is the heart of the game.  Both players must
consider their strengths and weaknesses.

The Russians costs political points to have air, air assaults, armor, air supply, airmobile, security, mech, heli, special ops, and propaganda units activated.   
They can be caught OOS and crushed by a Rebel counterattack if the Russians went too far forward from the supply base.  The Rebels, on the other hand, are mostly infantry and militia but have patriots (foreign volunteers).

Random events and random rebel reinforcements (with militia popping up all over the place) made every game different.   Another feature is the various special combat results tables for probe and assault attack, and psych warfare table (conducted by special ops, propaganda and patriot units)

Once the election is over, parliament sits; here a number of bills are proposed, and players bid on each issue.  There are several conflicting needs here.  The reigning party (most seats?) earns points if they cast their votes on the winning side of a vote.  Other parties earn points for successfully opposing the government.  There are two catches; firstly, voting against the interest of your supporters will cause you to lose seats, and secondly, you have a limited number of vote cards (yes/no/abstain), so you may be forced to vote contrary to your interests!

The aim of this strategic boardgame is to enslave at least 2 other Psi Clan Lords or control 16 planets throughout the universe's 5 dimensions.

Each Clan begins with owning 10 planets in their own dimension. Each planet begins with no defense.

Player collect up to 5 cards each turn and use these to either attack or defend planets in any 5 dimensions. Each attack will cost the player stimuli which can be gained each turn depending on the number of cards that is taken that turn.

By basically taking control of enemy planets, player can force enemy players onto a planet where they can no longer escape from. When this happens, the enemy player will become enslaved and must now work together with the attacking player. This is a great feature which prevents players who would normally have lost from being bored while waiting for the game to end.

The game features a 5 piece circular board so that the position of the 5 clans can be changed each game. Each player also has a cool stand to place their circular game cards in, and there's a handy little device from which players can slide out new game cards.

12718,Shipwreck!,1999,8,26,2.5,2,10,60,60,Wargames,Modern Warfare Nautical Wargame ,Dice RollingPaper-and-PencilSimulationSimultaneous Action Selection,"Vandering Publishing's Shipwreck is a very basic game of modern naval warfare.  It already has one supplement released - Freeplay '88, dealing with a NATO exercise in 1988.

The game has been compared to Harpoon 4, perhaps unfairly, as while it covers the same topic (modern naval warfare), the aim is present a much more global scope.  Command of small fleets of ships is very easy in this game, as weapon effectiveness is determined by a single value and weapon damage is a single value (heavy, medium, light, etc).

Ship damage are represented by a damage area with 4 damage levels - two 'lights', a 'heavy', and a 'critical' damage level.  When a weapon damages a ship, a d10 is rolled and the weapon's size is compared against the size of the target ship on a chart to see the resulting damage level (with a chance of 'none' being one of the levels).  If the given damage level is already called for, the next level up is used.  The net effect is as mirrored by hypothetical naval combat - ships take very few hits to be 'mission killed'.

Detection is handled within the rules in a very basic way, although special note should be made of the submarine rules.  They make use of 'range bands' around a target ship.  Submarines are not placed on the 'board' unless detected, making their approach and attack on these 'range band' diagrams, essentially their exact position unknown to BOTH players - neatly avoiding the need for a third player as referee almost always required in other games of the type.

The production values of the game are fairly high - no counters or maps are included, but, given the nature of most modern naval games to use miniatures or simply graph paper, that's certainly forgivable.  The game manual itself is printed on glossy paper with plenty of images throughout (several pages include color images) that really set the mood for the game.

The regimental unit identifies, battle strengths, and battle terrain were researched in detail in order to provide as much realism as possible, and give the players the feeling of having been involved in that part of history known as the American Revolution. The rules of play and the condition of victory have been designed to reproduce the actual conditions under which the battle was fought.

When playing the game, remember that winning is a relative term. It is sometimes more enjoyable to play as the commander of the weaker army, and see if you can produce a better result than the actual commander did. In the BATTLE OF CAMDEN, S.C. game, the winner can be decided on this basis. The player who performs better than his historical counterpart gains a measure of victory.

12722,Galactic War,1976,4.63636,11,2,2,2,45,45,Wargames,Science Fiction Wargame ,Point to Point MovementSimulation,"After centuries of squabbling and fighting mankind finally came to terms with itself in the 26th Century. A United Earth Government was formed, putting all the resources of the Earth into the Colonization of the Solar System. Mars became colonized, using vast agricultural schemes to promote a more healthy atmosphere; the steamy jungles of Venus were controlled and made habitable. In the 27th Century the Solar Federation was formed. Man now looked to the stars to expand further. The Federation's nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, some four and a quarter light years away, was explored and found to contain three habitable planets - Titan, Poseidon and Vidor. These were soon colonized by eager migrants from the Solar Federation's teeming
millions. The Galactic Federation was formed.
It is now the year 2975, and once again war threatens Mankind. The Galactic Federation is split and the Solar Federation finds itself fighting against the Proxima Centauri Alliance. Both sides have agreed not to violate the planets but to settle the conflict on a much larger battlefield - deep space. Both sides have similar space navies and also, because both developed from the same culture, similar weapons and defense systems. The only difference lies in the tactical capabilities of the spaceship commanders. You now have the chance to command a fleet of spaceships to see who rules the two star systems.

One of several titles released by Tabletop Games which were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a map) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used uncut cardstock counters. Other games in the series include Ballistic Missile, MTB, and Galactic War.

Two to four players compete by making investments and by choosing one of five tax options each turn. Players choose a tax option (Innocent, Honest, Shady, Illegal, or Fraudulent) by taking the top card from the pile of their choice and putting it on top of their own stack. The more dubious the tax option, the greater the reward; however, it is the top card showing on your stack that will determine how you fare should a player call an audit on you. Choosing an Innocent card can offer sufficient advantage in an audit that you may choose to audit yourself, especially if your opponents have likewise followed this path.

It includes scenarios for WWI, WWII, Angola, Vietnam, and the Boxer Rebellion. The scale is 1:1 skirmish.

Arc of Fire (AoF) is intended for games employing forces up to company level, with from one squad to three platoons on each side using 10mm-28mm miniatures, often with armor or artillery support. One of the prime design goals of AoF was to find a level of detail that was fun and easy, but still captured the flavor of skirmish gaming. If rifle magazine capacities, tanks power-to-weight ratios, or the quantity of high explosive in particular shells are the type of factors you really want in a game, you should probably not be looking at this book. The basic assumption of AoF is that leadership, training, organization and motivation are more important than minor technological advantages in deciding who wins. By concentrating on these rather than on kit, AoF produces a fast and exciting game that is more realistic than many games that obsess about technical detail.

I suppose that alone makes it fairly special.  Also, the rules state that it's for 2-4 players, but I see no reason why one person couldn't play solo with it.

The Goofy Golf Machine is almost more a toy than a game.  Like Mousetrap, the gameboard is dominated (in fact, consists of) a large Rube Goldberg-ish contraption.  Players use a plastic putter to flick a small (about 1cm in diameter) ball around a nine-hole miniature golf course.  Some holes require the ball to roll into an elevator which carries it up and dumps it into a spiral track leading to the hole.  Others require the ball to be hit up a ramp into a basketball hoop or rebounded off bumpers.  One hole even consists of a dangling plastic chicken that swings back and forth pendulum-style (a little oil might be useful for this one as there's too much friction as-is for the chicken to swing freely.)  Players have three chances to play each hole.  Whoever sinks their putt in the fewest shots is awarded a token--no tokens awarded for ties.  The ninth hole has two holes, one harder to reach than the other.  Players are awarded one token for sinking their putt into the easy hole, or two for the hard one.  The player with the most tokens wins.

It is a 3-D chess game that is played on 3 8x12 boards stacked above each other. The top board represents the air and features pieces like the Griffon and the Dragon. The middle board represents the land and has pieces like the Oliphant, the Thief, and (of course) the King. The bottom board represents the underworld and contains pieces like the Dwarf and the Elemental.

Like regular chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's King. Many pieces move like their chess counterparts, but many others have unconventional moves taken from other chess variants that are further complicated by the game's three dimensional nature.

For example, on the upper board, a Sylph piece moves like a Berolina pawn. It may make a non-capturing move one space diagonally forward, or it may capture by moving directly forward one space. It may also capture by moving straight down to the middle board. While on the middle board, the Sylph cannot move at all except to make a non-capturing move back to the top board. It may move to the square directly above it OR any empty one of the six home squares that any friendly Sylph occupied at the start of the game.

The basic object of the game is to collect points via Tooth Brush cards, Cavity Crasher super hero cards, Tooth Truth trivia cards, and the Healthy Tooth Award, while trying to fob off the dreaded Sweet Tooth card on another player.

There are three different levels of play. In the most simplistic, players simply collect Tooth Truth cards and ignore the trivia questions on them. In the standard game, players must answer the Tooth Truth question appropriate to their age and dental experience in order to win the card. Finally, when all players are of the same age group/experience, the players can choose the difficulty level of the question they wish to answer and receive points according to that difficulty level.

Also worthy of note are the metal movers used in the game. These are characters cast as lead figures, shaped like different types of teeth, and given names such as Sir Incisor.

It is a game in which two players match their strategic acumen by engaging two opposing fleets of symbolic warships. One fleet represents the Eastern Hemisphere and the other the Western Hemisphere.

The game was published in two editions. One version comes in a standard long box and contains 34 substantive metal ship pieces. A second version comes in an album-style slipcase and serves as a travel edition, with 34 magnetic ship components clearly identifiable via their silhouette, name and classification.

The ship classifications drive the comparative cruising and firing capabilities of the various warships which they emulate.

Rules for TWGBG offer seven different levels of increasingly detailed game play. Regardless of the level of play, however, the path to victory depends as much on putting the best players on the field as in the result cards one draws.

The use of result cards and a Special Events chart are reminiscent of the Action Cards and Z plays chart from a contemporary product, Statis-Pro baseball.

One additional detail regarding TWGBG should be noted. In this game, the players for each team in a given season are those who were set to appear on opening day for that year; however, the stats for that player come from the previous year. For example, stats on the 1980 Don Stanhouse (LA) card reflect his 1979 (Baltimore) performance. This differs from baseball game systems such as Strat-O-Matic or Statis Pro, where card sets were published only after a season was completed. TWGBG was intended for players who wanted to use the opening day rosters and play out a season as it was progressing.

An optional rule lets a player use the mother-in-law piece to block a couple containing that player's bride piece. The couple may only move past the mother-in-law on a restricted set of die rolls.

There are at least two printings of this game. The more deluxe printing uses a mock-velvet box lining and elastic bands to hold the player pieces, plus contains a setup sheet (printed with an interesting 3-D effect) that described various moves in the game.

In this 1950's Howard Hanson design, the players race to move their marbles over a 3-D board in a dash to a Uranium Strike. Short cuts and pitfalls lie ahead to both aid and hinder the players in their race. Each marble that successfully registers a Uranium Strike is scored and started over on the board; each marble that falls into Dead Man's Gulch is trapped and lost. The game ends when only one player has any marbles left. High score wins.

Happy Hour also offered players a BILLIONAIRE CERTIFICATE AND BUTTON in exchange for ten winning score sheets and $0.25.

The game does not include Asia. It is strictly a series of naval and island hopping maneuvering and battles fought in the Pacific. We always wanted to play with the boats more in AA, but we also wanted to win. The boats and planes are so expensive that no one can really afford to wage much sea war after the first turn or two in AA. Enter Conquest of the Pacific. Both sides face daunting tasks. Japan has a huge fleet, but has a lot of islands it needs to conquer to win, and ends up being so far away from its supply lines that it usually can't defend everything while still being able to challenge the growing American fleet. America starts the war far from a state of readiness, but its huge economic advantage helps make up for it. The front is close to the US, so supply lines are short, but the Japanese fleet is usually much larger if it can consolidate. This makes for some interesting cat and mouse maneuvering and epic sea battles.

Planes take a large role in Conquest of the Pacific as they are able to:

1. land and take off from islands without it costing a movement point because the island and the sea zone(s) surrounding/adjacent to the island are considered the same zone.

2. project their defensive power one sea zone away from their island base zone during the opponent's combat phase.

3. defensively scramble to attack anything entering their zones of projected power during the opponent's turn on the combat movement and non-combat movement phases.

4. escort other units to protect them from defensive scramblers.

Battleships and Destroyers may bombard every round during an invasion, or once per turn without a land invasion. Battleships and Carriers take two hits to kill and can be repaired at several ports on the map. And, be on the lookout for the Japanese SuperBattleship, the Yamato. It attacks, defends, and bombards at a 5 and takes 3 hits to kill, ouch! It really is fun to get to play with all the expensive pieces!

12839,Operation Barbarossa,2000,6.84,5,3,2,4,120,120,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Area MovementDice Rolling,"Up to 4 people can play, one controlling each German army group (North, Center, and South), and one playing Russia. Russia gets 5 factories to place in the cities of their choosing at the beginning of the game. Each produces a specific unit type (2 infantry, 1 armor, 1 fighter, 1 bomber). Germany can't see anything in Russian cities. Russia keeps its units and factories hidden from view on a city card. When Russian troops move out of cities, they are moved from the city card to the main board.

Railroads connect many of the Russian cities, which they can use to non-combat troops from city to city hidden from German view. Germany may try to cut the rails to limit Russian movement. Germany may scout Russian cities with a bomber to try and find out what is there, however, you can't scout and attack on the same army group's turn. Therefore, one army group must scout, and the next in the turn sequence can attack.

The German players must work closely together in this game. German troops may be transferred from one army group to another, and are then controlled by that new groups player. Because of the hidden units, it is a game of high tension on both sides. Most of the time Germany isn't really sure what Russia has in a city it is about to attack. And, most of the time, Russia has nowhere near enough troops to defend everything they need to defend. There is a lot of cat and mouse, educated guessing, and downright devious strategy (Hum, he would expect me to do this, so I'll do that. But he might be counting on me taking the less obvious choice...

The goal is for Germany to take Moscow, but to do this, they almost always need to take out the Russian factories which are producing units closer to the front. To make matters worse, Russia can dismantle, and move each of their factories once to another city. So, just when you think you have it all figured out... We're usually nervous wrecks by the end of a game...and usually ready to start another one right away!

12840,Synapse,2004,4.66667,3,0,2,2,10,10,,Card Game Print & Play Real-time ,Pattern RecognitionTile Placement,"Synapse is a real-time card game in which cards are used as tiles to play into rows and columns of a 6x6 grid.  Placement of tiles is concurrent and play ends when one player places his last card, much as in the game Light Speed.  The tiles are then scored based upon adjacent symbols which are the same in color, shape or number.

The game is available for free download from the Black and White Games website:

http://www.fairplaygames.com/newworldgames/bnw/synapse/synapse.htm

From Mike Petty and the game's website:

Synapse is a two-player game where players race to arrange their cards into scoring positions.

Like many real-time games, the play of the cards is fast and furious, then the scoring takes a little while as players figure out who actually won! Since only a complete understanding of scoring will allow a player to make good plays, however, it may be a little hard (while reading these rules) to understand when, where and maybe even why a player would place a cards into play. For now, suffice it to say that cards placed next to each other are potentially worth points if the icons on their adjacent sides match up in either shape, number or color. Sometimes a player will want to aim for matches worth maximum points. Other times he may want to form connections worth no points at all, in hopes of stopping his opponent from scoring. All the while a player has to keep a close eye on what his opponent is up to!

As far as the design goes, Synapse is my attempt at a real-time game that has no luck and no room for cheating during the fast play. I think it succeeds well on these two accounts.

Thus, you play the game on an 1818 grid.

The 'pieces' are 33 patterns of go stones, with each possible pattern of stones representing a different type of piece, each of which moves in a different way.  Rather than the pieces remaining the same throughout the game, however, a player can use any 33 portion of the board that contains at least one of his stones and none of his opponent's stones.  This means that two pattern-pieces can move near each other, and then portions of each of the original pieces can be moved away together as a different piece, leaving behind the remainder of the original formations, which can, in turn, be used as other pieces.

If a piece moves in such a way that it overlaps one or more stones (of either player), all stones that the piece moves onto are captured.

Each player must maintain one piece that is a ring of eight stones around an empty square at all times.  If one player is in a position where he no longer has such a ring anywhere on the board for any reason, he loses.

Players make their way through a molded plastic three-dimensional multi-roomed Haunted House (which is almost as large as the box) using a unique owl fruit-machine type spinner that actually 'hoots' to direct movement, until one reaches the point - a secret door - where a Jewel is located. Thereafter the leader is always in possession of this Jewel.

The player holding the Jewel who is first to land on the appropriate square (by exact count) escapes the Haunted House and wins the game.

Monopoly, the greatest property trading board game finds its home in Wales. You can now play the classic game with the street names, landmarks and locations which give the country its distinct identity.

It has a rich cultural heritage, evident in the lyrical language and the explosive arts scene, as one of Europe's oldest nations advances with new optimism and confidence.

12921,Bootleg,1984,0,0,0,2,6,30,30,,Racing Transportation ,Pick-up and DeliverPoint to Point MovementRoll / Spin and Move,"Harking back to the days of Prohibition, BOOTLEG recreates the thrill of running loads of illegal whiskey from city to city wile avoiding the county Sheriffs and the State Trooper.

Players start as bootleggers and must pick up and deliver loads while avoiding speeding tickets or being busted.

There are just enough restrictions on movement to generate tension when your turn comes. Initially the Sheriffs - one for each county - and the State Trooper are moved automatically after each players turn. But once a player has delivered whatever loads he chooses or, all the loads available (hidden in the bushes) are in transit, he can become a Sheriff or State Trooper just by passing one on the highway. Then he can attempt to bust other players.

Components are of medium quality. 6 Vans, County Sheriffs, 1 State Trooper, 50 plastic chips representing various loads and a stack of money. The rules are very short, perhaps 300 words. The game comes with an additional rules update sheet. The map is plain 4-color and on sturdy paper.

The player with the most money after everyone has obtained and erected all eighteen elements of a complete lot is the winner.

The game comes with three unique dice: The Contract Die (used to purchase a lot, which is needed to start, get permits and insurance), The Material Die (used to get the eighteen elements of a complete set) and The Building Die (to determine how many elements can built or eliminated from the player's lot). On a turn, a player chooses the die and follows takes or declines the action permitted by the roll. Whenever a player rolls The Material Die, the top chance card is read. The chance card could reward or penalize a sum of money. Players may barter with each other for materials.

12923,Three on a Match,1972,5.7,10,0,3,4,60,60,,Movies / TV / Radio theme Trivia ,Auction/Bidding,"Based on the game show's original (1971-73) format, the emcee chooses four prizes and places three sets of three cards in the board; the last prize only has two cards put in, along with a No Match card.

Three categories are shown, and the players bid on how many true/false questions (1-4) they can answer. High bid plays the questions, while ties cancel out. The total number from the bids is multiplied by $10 and becomes the prize for the round (for example, 4-3-2 would be worth $90), although choosing a Double Pot category doubles the amount available (maximum of $220). Once a player answers a set of questions correctly and has at least $140 (the show required just $90), s/he may try to go to the board.

The board contains four colored rows (Red-Green-Yellow-Blue) and three amounts ($20-$30-$40); the player in control calls out the money and color (i.e., Forty on the Red) and can buy as many boxes as possible until either matching or not having enough to buy appropriately, with one catch: a column is closed when three of its boxes are picked. Matching awards that prize's value to the player's score, and the first to $5,000 ($4,000 if only two people are playing the questions with an emcee) wins.

If the first three picks of a game match, that player wins the prize and a jackpot which starts at $100 and increases by $100 each time it is not won.

From April 1973 until the show's end in June 1974, the format changed to matching pictures; the first player to get three matches won the game and $5,000 in prizes.

An exciting word game requiring logic, imagination and intuition.  A game for any number of players, as individuals, partners, or teams.

There are no right or wrong answers here!  You simply have to match your answer to that of your partner.  From a three-letter word fragment, you select a word or words that the letters might stand for or would logically contain those letters.  I know that sounds complicated, but it really is not. (i.e. USA - United States of America; LTR could be letter, later, litter, etc.)  Some are easy, others more difficult.  You may choose what level you play on and receive your score accordingly, or roll the dice and take your chances.

Why LOCUTION? As your teacher would say, look it up.  OK, so it's not an exact description of the game, but it's the best I could do on my first attempt at something like this.  I had an idea that I thought some people might enjoy, and friends agreed -- so here it is!  Not having the resources of a big game company, I am doing the best I can.

I believe this is a great game for groups -- even large groups -- with participation by all players.  The first time you play it, you'll get your money's worth; after that, it's free!!!

Oh, sorry gals, the guys have the advantage here, so guys against gals is not recommended.  It seems that men's limited vocabulary gives the guys an edge!

The ships have a limited cargo space and the cargo comes in amounts ranging from 1/4 to 3/4 loads, the players require an element of luck when being offered a cargo and a degree of skill when selecting which cargoes that they are willing to accept.

The players then plot their own course around the playing board and are required to pay for the running cost for their ships at the end of each turn of play, on reaching the correct port the player will offload his or her cargo and collect the payment for that cargo from the banker.

At the end of the game it is the player with the most money that is the winner, the fact that large amounts of money can be gained or lost on a single trip means that they is no obvious winner until the very end of the game.

12935,World War II in the East,2004,6.75,4,0,1,5,360,360,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Dice RollingHex-and-CounterSimulation,"World War II in the East is a division-corps scale wargame depicting the Second World War in Asia and the Pacific.

World War II in the East gives you control of all of the major participating nations that fought World War II, and allows you to play a simple yet accurate portrayal of the war. World War II in the East can be played with Axis and Allies figures and rules, but is meant to be played as a stand-alone game with over 900 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces, if they wish.

In fact, World War II in the East can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.

With World War II in the East, you fight major carrier engagements, have air battles over Guadalcanal, conduct landing operations on the many island chains of the Pacific, outflank and surround forces in Burma, as Japan transport resources from Southeast Asia and the East Indies, and manage the industrial output of your nation.

World War II in the East includes over 900 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Australian, New Zealander, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known American fighter squadron that fought with China against the Japanese.

The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 47 by 36 inches. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 300km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.

The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from December 1941 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Scenarios allowing you to play shorter scenarios will be posted on the publisher's website as they become available.

World War II in the Easts complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional counter wargames as its complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.

World War II in the East can be combined with World War II in the West to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!

12960,Isis Süsse Sünde,2004,4.5,4,1,2,4,60,60,,Card Game Educational Math ,,"From the publisher, CommonGame:

This family-based educational game, Ages 10 and up, is meant for anyone who wants to know more about nutrition, lose weight or simply want to have fun playing the game. Isis Ssse Snde is the first board game that incorporates eating, exercise and life's little guilty pleasures in a fun and enjoyable game. Even so, players quickly learn the caloric values of various food types and how much energy is used up by various activities.

The food pyramid is an important help in making sure players get a balanced diet. During the game, players collect food cards and add together the calorie values shown on the cards. Once a player has gone over the maximum number of calories dictated by the game (1750-2250 kcal), then that player must move their figure along the exercise track. By drawing an exercise card, the player may then reduce their calorie total by the indicated number of calories again. But just as in real life, sweet treats and unexpected events make it hard to keep on track and so make it harder to win the game.

Scenarios include the historical set up with the Saxons waiting on Senlac Ridge and the Normans formed up in the valley below, an alternative scenario that allows the Normans more freedom in deploying their army and one that gives Harold the option of moving down onto the valley floor to force the Normans to fight across boggy ground.

The Battle of Thermopylae, 480 BC,was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states and the invading Persian army in the pass of Thermopylae. Greatly outnumbered, the Greeks delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Led by the Spartan King, Leonidas, a small force of 300 Spartans and 11,000 other allied Greeks blocked the only road through which the mighty army of the Persian King, Xerxes, could pass on its ongoing invasion of Greece. The massive Persian army, numbering well over 150,000 men succeeded in defeating the Greeks but sustained heavy losses, disproportionate to those of the Greeks. A local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks, revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers to delay the advance of the Persian army as long as it could.

In the Battle of Thermopylae 2nd Edition board game is a 2 player board game where the two players must bid to see which player will control the smaller Greek forces. The winning bid becomes the number of Persian units the Greek player must destroy during the course of battle in order to achieve victory. An easy to learn game playable in just 30-120 minutes.

As in Bridge, we find two partnerships against each other: in the auction, the partners should propose a contract, i.e. a suit and a number of tricks they plan to take. The trick, in effect, is made by confrontation between the value of the word you place on the board (as in Scrabble) and the one of the previous player: so, any word is considered in 2 tricks (the one with the previous and the one with the following player). The suit proposed by the winner of the auction is the trump for the round: once played, the tiles with this suit on will receive a bonus in points. 
The game is played in 3 rounds: any player receive a random set of tiles per round. At the end of any round, the teams score victory points according to the contract made at the beginning of the round.

Its original form was metal tops (usually brass) with 6 to 10 sides. The dice version, which originated in the 1940s, is played with a Put and Take die (printed with 3 Ts and 3 Ps) and a number die (printed with 1-2-3-3-4-A).

Players ante up a chip and then roll the dice. If a player gets a P he puts a number of chips into the pot matching the number shown on the other die. If he gets a T he takes a number of chips equal to the number shown on the other die from the pot. Rolling an A on the numbered die means All (T+A means take all chips in the pot and P+A means you match the pot). Players are eliminated as they run out of chips. The last player still holding chips wins.

Early versions of Put and Take dice were made out of metal, wood, and bakelite.

There are the same numerical cards, 2-10, Jack (Knight), Queen, King and Ace. And like in some Poker varients the Ace may be played as high or low. Whereas a standard Poker deck has four suites, Swords  Dragons has eight. And there is a similarity in which one hand will defeat another.

The game play appears to be a mix of Hold 'Em, Stud Poker and Go Fish. Cards can be asked for and received by another player if one hasn't hidden them in their Trove. The Trove allows a player to hold up to four cards without worry of them being asked for in Go Fish style. Essentially players can use the cards in their hand and the one Up card, that being the last card discarded, as their current hand. The Up card may also be taken by a player on their turn and the discard becomes the new Up card.

A round ends when all but one player folds - due to not calling a raise, or the deck runs out of cards.. or, all players call the raise. Then a showdown occurs and it's winner take all.

The components are a bit flimsy. Two medium quality shrinkwrapped decks stashed in a cotton bag, a photocopied rules set and a white fold-up box with a label glued on. The retail is $14.99

Each player shuffles his own 16 tiles and places them face down, then white draws his top tile and places it, with the piece oriented so it looks upright to him. Black then draws the top tile in his pile and places it so that it touches white's piece, either orthogonally or diagonally, and oriented so that it looks upright to him.

At that point, white can either add another piece or move his piece on the board. A move must be a legal chess move and may not separate any element of the board; all pieces much remain touching, even if just diagonally, when a move has ended. Thus you can pin a piece by placing a new piece on the far corner of a piece already in play.

The game ends in checkmate or stalemate, with a stalemate occurring when you must place your king into check when you draw it.

Chex was originally published in 1982 by IQ Products as Chess Cards. The rules in that version differ significantly from those in the later self-published version.

At the end of the game, the player with the most cards in his/her pile gets 3 points; each Lucky One you collected gets you one point, and the Lucky Two and Lucky Ten are worth two points each (there are only one of each of these).

The cards are illustrated with crudely drawn cartoon images of Laurel  Hardy, alas - photos would have made the game worthwhile for adults, at least as a collector's item.

13044,Havoc,1986,5.8,5,3,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Point to Point Movement,"In Havoc each player has 17 pawns which start in his home area or waiting to enter.  Each turn you move three pawns one or two spaces each.  The board shows a fairly complex network of spaces, most of which have arrows on them showing mandatory movement direction.  Some spaces have two arrows, offering a choice.  In the center the board are four spaces with stars on them.

If you move onto an opponent's piece, you capture it and place it on your Speed Card.  As your speed card fills up, you move faster: capturing two pawns allows one of your pawns to move up to three spaces while the other two may still move only one or two spaces.  Capturing four pawns allows two pawns to move three spaces each, and your sixth pawn captured lets you move all three pawns up to three spaces.  Once you've captured eight pawns, one may move up to four spaces, and so on.

The game is basically following the arrows and moving around the paths trying to capture opponents.  You can also capture pawns by moving onto two star spaces in the same turn.  These can be captured from opponents' starting spaces or from an opponent's Speed Card.

Last person with any pawns left alive wins the game.

It contains 112 cards, lots of money and a few playing mats. The mats are only as a guide for learning, showing you how to build sets.

The theme is elimination. You have to build contracts from sets of compatible cards. At the very least, a Victim and Means card are required to open a contract. The contract can then grow by playing in order: Scene and Hit cards of the same suit as the Means card (which there are seven suits - Strangulation, Poisoning, Drowning, Torture, Shooting, Starving and Hit  Run). Thereafter, you can optionally play a Disposal, then an Alibi card on the sequence Means, Scene,  Hit that you've built up. You can play a motive card on top (at any time on an open contract) - which must be of the same suit as the victim (there are eight suits - Royalty, Union Leader, Movie Star, Pet, Politician, Business Person, Religious Leader and Choose your own victim).

The aim is to earn the most money, and money is earned by closing contracts. To score, a contract must contain a Victim, Means, Scene and Hit card.

Game Play:

Pick a team (a deck).  Draw 4 cards.  If you're the team at bat, you start.  Now, you can play a hit card (Single, Home Run, etc.).  If you're the team in the field, you can respond by playing an out card (Tag Out, Fly Out, etc.).  Keep taking turns until there are 3 outs.  The player with the most runs at the end of 9 innings wins.

a quote regarding this game   it seems that Dad's Army is no laughing matter for the people who run eBay.

The auction website has banned from sale a board game based on the much loved comedy series, calling it 'offensive material' that could 'promote violence, hatred, racial or religious intolerance'.

The family game features on its lid the swastikas and Union Flag symbols instantly recognizable from the opening titles of the series.

The board itself shows Walmingtonon-on-Sea, which has been occupied by Nazi troops.

Players roll a dice to collect 'bombs' and 'landmines' before swiping swastika markers off the board and replacing them with British flags to reclaim territory.

The aim is to get members of the platoon, including Captain Mainwaring, Sergeant Wilson and Corporal Jones, to a 'safe' location while watching out for the enemy.

The instructions say: 'In war you've not only the Jerry to contend with, but Dad's Army too - and we're not sure which of them is worse!'

The game was produced by Denys Fisher in the mid-1970s, at the height of the show's popularity.

    First, each player starts with a limited supply of play money. There are costs associated with various moves, so it is possible to lose by running out of money.



    Second, each player only starts with five of their eight pieces on the board, and must pay to bring the other three onto the board when space in the back row becomes available for them.



    Third, the games spaces have costs or rewards associated with them. Most of the spaces will cost money.



    Fourth, there is a safe corridor between the four board quarters. A player may not be captured when in that safe area, but may capture a piece when coming onto another board.


The game ends when only one player has any money left, when only one player has any pieces left, or when one player has successfully confined their last opponent within their own home board.

The starting player then deals out Catch Them cards equal to the number of villains a player faces.

The starting player then takes the card from the top of the Catch Them deck and either keeps it (if it is one of the villains she needs) or passes it to the player on her left. If she keeps it, she must pass another card from her hand. The player on the left must now either keep or pass. In the mean time, the starting player is looking at the next card from the deck and deciding to keep or pass. This continues around the table, with all players keeping and passing cards until one player collects all the villains indicated on her Villain card.

The first player to collect all the villains she needs grabs the Bubbles bobblehead from the center of the board. The other players now try to grab one of the other Powerpuff Girls from the center. Since there is one less Powerpuff Girl than there are players, one player won't get anything (ala musical chairs).

The player who ended up with nothing does not move. Players who grabbed a Powerpuff Girl move one space along the board. The player who grabbed Bubbles spins the spinner and moves either 3, 4 or 5 spaces. Rounds are repeated until a player reaches the Finish space and wins the game.

13147,Fortress Rhodesia,1976,6.125,4,3,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Modern Warfare Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterSimulation,"This wargame covers all of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as well as guerrilla supply locations in neighboring countries.  It pits the government forces (army, air force and police) against the rebel forces of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU).

It is not explicitly stated when the game is set, noting that the first important guerrilla incident took place in 1968, but the implication is that the game is set in 1975.  It last 24 game turns.

This game was published in 1976 so would represent contemporary events.  It starts with an (undated) prediction from a South African general that the white minority regime in Rhodesia could hold out against the outside-supported guerrillas a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 2 years.(The bulk of the population lived outside the modern world and did not care much who won).  I guess this is the timescale of the game and it is attempting to predict the military outcome.

The difference is that the cards have a rock-paper-scissors relationship to each other: Gomez takes Morticia...Morticia takes the children...the children take Gomez. The Lurch and Uncle Fester (Wild) cards take any other cards.

The entire deck is dealt out evenly to the players. Players take their top card and place it face up on the table. The player who turned over the highest value card wins both the cards. If cards have equal value, then each player continues playing cards face up until only one player turns over a card that matches the original cards. This player wins all the cards played.

The player who takes all the cards in the deck wins. For more than 2 players the game is played in a series of round robin duels.
