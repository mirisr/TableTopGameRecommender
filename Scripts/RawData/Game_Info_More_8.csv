Players use their colored chips (each worth $1,000 in play money) to bet on the suit, the rank, and the exact face of the card predicted next.  There is an unique way to get back into the game if you lose all your money.

The game ends when either a. the predetermined time limit expires, b. the bank runs out of money, or c. all players have been eliminated.

The game comes with a hubcap size tray that is round on the bottom so that it tilts and spins. The tray has 4 colored cups spaced evenly around the rim, and 20 marbles (5 each of four different colors matching the cups) are placed in the tray. Each player takes a dolphin grabber that has the same color handle as the cup in front of him. The grabber has a dolphin head on its end that closes its mouth when you pull the trigger on the handle.

At the count of three, all players use their dolphins to grab marbles from the tray that match their cups color. The first player to put all five of his marbles in his cup wins.

After you reply, you can move up one space on the game board--unless another player challenges your answer.

For a challenge, both you and the challenger place your fingers on the electronic Fib Finder. The challenger repeats the question into the microphone and you repeat the answer. The challenger then removes her finger and the Fib Finder will show green (true: move ahead 2, move challenger back 2), red (false: move back 2, challenger ahead 2), or yellow (unsure: move ahead one like normal).

The first player to reach the Totally Truthful space, or the only player not on the All Time Fibber space, wins.

The Doodlers follow the directions of the Instructor, trying to recreate the object on their Doodle Sheet. No one can look at another's drawing. Once the Instructor announces the description is complete, each Doodler secretly writes down what they think the object on their sheet is.

Each correct identification is worth one point to the Instructor. Each correct Doodler gets one point. So, if 3 Doodlers guess correctly, they each get one point and the Instructor gets 3 points. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.

This lower tray is where you need to align four in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) to win. So players may drop marbles tactically - to make an alignment, or strategically - to shift the levers for a future drop and/or block an opponent's move.

I'm not sure because on top of having no Publisher or Designer listed on the box, there is no year of publication listed either.

The object is for each player to play out his letters by forming words to the crossword layout.

Some differences from Scrabble are: 

    When you place a word on a square with a star you throw a die and then receive a bonus of 5 or 10 times the die roll. 
    There are no plurals allowed. 
    There are four blank tiles. 
    Words are scored at 5 points per letter. 
    Challenges to words cost 25 points to either player depending on if the challenge was successful or not.

TANGLE
The Game of Strategy and Capture
For 2,3 or 4 players

Copyright 1964 By SELCHOW  RIGHTER COMPANY, Bay Shore, New York
Made in U.S.A.

Directions for Playing

Introduction
Tangle is a game of pure skill and strategy, there is absolutely no luck or chance involved. All playing pieces are in full view allowing the players to anticipate each strategic move.

Contents:

    1 Playing Board with 93 hexagon (six sided) shapes called Tangle Tiles.
    116 Playing Pieces  29 of each color.
    4 Scoring Keys
    4 Storage Trays
    4 Scoring Rims




Object Of Game:
The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.

How To Score Points:
1. When a player encloses all six sides of a Tangle Tile with his particular color playing pieces, he has captured that tile and scores points.
2. Tangle playing pieces-values:

    Only the final piece that completes the surrounding of the Tangle Tile counts toward point value and only if all six sides of the Tangle Tile are surrounded by the same color.




3. Each playing piece has its own point value.
Note: There are six shapes from small to large point values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, and 5 points.
4. Tangle Tile values:
The Tangle Tiles on the board also have point values, which are added to the value of the final playing piece that completes the surrounding of a Tangle Tile. These values are as follows:

    Plain Tile  1 point.
    Circular Design Tile  2 points
    Triangular Design Tile  2 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.
    Square Design Tile  4 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.




The Play:
1. Each players first turn must start with one side of his playing piece touching one of the six sides of the Center Star Tangle Tile.
2. Players alternate turns.
3. All pieces in play must be continuously connected (regardless of color) even when blocking.
4. If a player places a playing piece on the board which does not complete a Tangle Tile his turn ends.
5. A player is entitled to an immediate extra turn for every Tangle Tile he completely surrounds in his own color.
6. Total points are kept on the scoring rim as each Tangle Tile is surrounded.

Conclusion Of Game:
Play is ended when one player has used all his playing pieces or when one player has reached the total of 50 points.

Winner:
The player with the highest total of points when the game ends.

Play For Partners:
Partners sit facing each other. If Green and Blue pieces are on one team, points are scored for that team when tiles are surrounded 1. All in Green, 2. All in Blue, or 3. In Blue and Green.

One card is turned face up at the start. The next player has to make a word starting with that letter and constructed from the letters on the cards in his hand. The next player's word must start on the last letter of the first player's word, and so on.

The first player to get rid of all cards wins that round. All the other players get a score depending on what cards they have left. Uncommon letters have a low score, common ones have a higher score and wildcards are really expensive. The less points at the end, the better.

The distribution of letters on the cards is weighted for Swedish. On the whole it works well, but the letter h is surprisingly difficult to get rid of. There are very few Swedish words of a reasonable length that have h anywhere but first. On the other hand, h is cheap.

The farmer, sensing a surfer's hunger for the sport, reluctantly grants permission to trespass.  His only request, don't let the rabbits out of the pen - or they'll reproduce and eat my produce.  Well, curiosity doesn't kill the cat here, but it does create a stir, when one surfer inadvertently opens the pen containing the rabbits the farmer had retrieved from his property.  Now, faced with humiliation and banishment from the farm, and their shortcut to good waves, the surfers must catch all the rabbits.

OBJECTIVE: To be the first player to have all his/her rabbits make into (sic) the safety of the brier (sic) patch. Each player always has two moves; rabbits first, and the woody second. (The 'White Die' moves the Rabbits, the 'Blue Die' moves the Woody).

On the box is the text 3:e frgeserien (3rd series of questions), so I assume that this game has earlier editions.

The publishing year of 1950 is a guess, mostly from the general appearance of the game and the fact that is has categories like war criminal and concentration camp.

This game helps young players to develop color recognition and matching skills as well as important social skills:  taking turns, following rules, and sharing.

This is a different game from the same-named Very Hungry Caterpillar Game, which is made further confusing because both games have very similar box-fronts, using the same picture from the cover of the book.  This game uses a Cootie or Jumbolino mechanism where players must collect pieces based on random rolls/spins.

It is suitable for ship models of all scales from 1:2400 to 1:1200 to 1:900. The game is primarily designed for the Revolutionary  Napoleonic Wars, but with some modifications can be used for earlier eras.

Fire As She Bears! is of easy to moderate complexity. Most of the game's rules are fairly intuitive after you have completed a scenario or two. The emphasis is on fleet actions. Players act as squadron or fleet commanders rather than individual ship captains. Fire As She Bears! allows you to experience the chaos of naval combat without written orders or cumbersome paperwork.

The 2nd Edition rule set is published in PDF and JPG format. There are over 30 pages of rules, numerous tables and sailing charts, 25 pages of full color examples of play, three sample scenarios, over 80 pages of ship record sheets, and an Excel spreadsheet for creating other ship record sheets. Included are the standard rules, as well as, optional rules for Forts, Night Actions, Fog, Fireships, (etc.) and special rules applying only to Frigates and Sloops.

13236,Der Schwarze Prinz,1983,3.75,4,0,2,2,40,40,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Hand Management,"Der Schwarze Prinzor The Black Prince

This is an abstract conflict game along the lines of chess, with high production values for its time, in which 2 players aim to capture the central piece of the opponent's army. The rules stress that is based on the first major land battle of the Hundred Years' War, the 1345 Battle of Crcy, but only if you ignore factors as terrain, the tactics of the time, the fact that the French had twice as many troops, the decisive deployment of the longbow by the Welsh and English archers, and that there was only one Black Prince (on the English side). And that it actually took place in 1346, on August 26.

So, stripped of any historical constraints, both Field Commanders now oversee 2 identical armies, consisting of 4 different soldier classes, each with different movement options, but also, like chess, of equal capturing strength. Besides armies on the board, both players always have 3 special cards which are the main engine behind the thrust of the game.

Whether an attack is successful or not doesn't depend on the attacking piece, but if the attack card, that gets played with each attack, can be stopped by a suitable counter card held by the defender. Since players always have a hand-size of three cards, the battles are not decided by clever maneuvering and the interaction of different pawn abilities, but simply by the luck of the draw. Nothing will save you if you have the wrong cards.

Combining a chess-like game with card play was a nice idea, but unfortunately the way it was implemented simply reduced the board game element to a mere sideshow, and put luck firmly at the center of each victory.

Publication history: one of Johann Rttinger's earliest games, and when it appeared by Noris Spiele in 1983 it even became his second nomination for Spiel des Jahres in two years, after Vokabo made the shortlist in 1982.

13241,Bullwinkle's Supermarket Game,1976,3.5,3,1,2,4,15,15,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Pattern BuildingTile Placement,"This is a simple Bingo-like game. There is a board with a 5 x 4 grid. Each of the spaces contains a picture of a particular grocery item as well as a background color (one of 5). There are also 20 cards which match the 20 spaces of the board. These cards are divided among the players. The object of the game is to be the first player who places a card on the board that completes a column or row.

On his turn, the player spins a spinner which is divided into 5 spaces, one of each of the colors on the board and cards. The player may then choose a card in his hand of the color spun and place it on its corresponding space on the board. If he does not have a card of that color he passes. He may also choose to pass if he thinks it would make it easier for an opponent to complete a column or row.

In order to travel along the track, the player rolls a die and moves forward that number of spaces. If he ends up on a joke track, he rolls the die again and tells a joke of one of the following 6 types:


    Knock-Knock
    News Flash
    Limerick
    Riddles
    Impersonations
    Tongue Twisters


If the player cannot think of a joke of the type rolled, he can look at one of the many Joke Cards that comes with the game. (These all seem to be G rated and many are very UK-oriented.)

After telling a joke, the player rolls the die again to get a base score. This score will be modified by certain attributes pertaining to his joke telling, which include whether he used his own joke and how a vote of the other players goes. The player then moves forward a number of spaces equal to his revised score (or backwards if his score ends up negative). His turn continues until he lands on a non-joke space.

These other spaces involve drawing event cards that give directions to be followed and some Snakes and Ladders type spaces.

The first player to end up in the center space by exact movement wins.

There must be 2 National League and 2 American League teams chosen.

The board is a representation of a baseball infield, with 7 spaces between each base. Each of the spaces has a logo of one of the (at the time) 28 Major League teams. They are grouped on each base path by the divisions at the time, i.e. the AL West is between home and first base, the NL East, between first and second, etc.

Players must advance around the diamond, stopping at each base. Once a player reaches home, he counts a win. The first player in each league to get 4 wins in the first round (the LCS) advances to the next round (the World Series). The first player to get 4 wins in the World Series wins the game.

Each base, including home plate, must be reached by exact count. To begin, the player spins a spinner with 8 spaces. One of the spaces allows the player to immediately go to first base and place his helmet there, while the others have a logo of a team that was, at the time, in the AL West. If the player lands on one of these, he puts his helmet on that team's space. In subsequent turns he rolls a die and advances his helmet towards the base, if he can do so. If the roll is higher than he can use, he stays where he is until his next turn.

Once he gets to a base, he repeats the process, starting by spinning the spinner for the new division he is traveling through.

Peaceful players disarm (discard face-down) Swords cards and build sets of Plowshares, Manpower, and Cogwheels, while the Warmonger secretly disarms Plowshares and other non-Swords cards and builds using Swords instead of Plowshares.

Points are awarded for building sets and for successfully deducing who the Warmonger is (the Warmonger gets points if no one figures this out).

The tiles allow you to lay siege on a city. A besieged city that is completed only yields 1 point per tile (2 if it includes a cathedral). Peasants supply the city as well as its besiegers, so every completed besieged city counts twice for them.

Availability:

     The Siege tiles with the original art ('Die Katharer') are exclusive to German magazine Spielbox.  They were included in issue 5/2004 (October/November) and the August 2005 'Der Carcassonne Almanach'.  (Artist is Doris Matthus.)
     The Siege has been re-released with new art by Rio Grande Games in October 2008 as part of the Mini Compilation Cult, Siege & Creativity.  (Some have expressed concern with the new artwork as it is harder to see that a city is under siege.)
     A 6 tiles version of The Siege called 'Die Belagerer' (again with new art but similar to the Rio Grande edition) is part of the Carcassonne Müller Exklusiv-Edition released in 2013 and sold by the German trade company Mller. It's also available now through Cundco.

The Creatures that Ate New York is a lightweight takeoff on The Creature that Ate Sheboygan. Up to seven players may play. Each player has a secret objective, which could involve destroying a certain Manhattan location or just beating up on the other monsters.

Napoleon at Waterloo was one of SPI's standard introductory games. It is a traditional two-player wargame designed by James Dunnigan.

The Tower of Azann is billed as fantasy role-playing, however it is closer to choose your own adventure. One or more players have characters journeying through the Tower. Unlike the other two entries, this game did not include counters or a map. No gamemaster is needed, the game is based on a paragraph system and movement between the rooms is sometimes governed by a die roll.

Battles are fought out over a small hex grid, with terrain overlaid terrain tiles and single-hex unit counters. Size of armies is usually around 10-12 units. There are no dice involved in combat resolution, so the battle is decided entirely by the tactical skill of the players in deploying and maneuvering their units (thus the likeness to Chess).

Phalanx was published in issue 165 of Slingshot, the Society of Ancients journal (back issues on CD are available to members).

13343,MetaMemes,2004,7,2,0,3,5,60,60,,,Co-operative PlayStorytelling,"Using cards with various Ideas, Things, and Words, players combine these concepts, or memes, to create new inventions.  In a sense, the game play is brainstorming with a scoring mechanism.

Each player takes turns as Storm Initiator, and plays a card (meme) from their hand.  Other players then propose another card from their hand that might combine with the Storm Initiator's card to create an interesting idea.  The initiator chooses one, and those players then take a few minutes to develop the idea.  The initiator keeps the resulting idea.

Play then passes to the next player.  After each player has two such ideas, he chooses one to be scored.  Each player distributes points to the other player's ideas, and the IDEA that collects the most points is the winner.

The playing area is a well-designed plastic arena, with a football pitch embossed on the green baize playing area.  Players take it in turns to launch attacking moves based on combinations of dice throws. The defender then has a chance to save the shot, before launching a counter attack. Mechanically, Tir et But owes quite a lot to poker dice, the strategy depending mainly on assessing the risk after the first attacking throw and selecting which dice to retain, whilst re-throwing the remainder. Instructions are in French only, but are very easy to grasp, with a simplified crib-card on the back of the box. A Rugby version of the game, employing identical mechanics, is also available.

Cast iron, slightly convex disks are thrown onto a soft-wooden board (la planche) from a distance of 5 metres. Players attempt to throw their palets closest to the master Palet (le maitre / the jack).  Each Palet a player lands nearer to the jack than their opponents' palets counts one point. First player to reach 12 points wins the game.  The more you play Palet, the more the board cuts up with dents and divots. When la planche est faite this adds to the unpredictable behavior and charm of the game.

ChineseChek - Nothing to do with Chinese Checkers, this is Dots and Boxes on a triangular grid (in the form of a 6-pointed star) for 2-4 players.  There are special spaces which are worth more points than the rest.

NineTacToe - 2 players play Tic-Tac-Toe on 9 grids simultaneously.  The spaces are numbered 1-27, each number being used 3 times, and on a turn a player chooses a number and plays in the corresponding 3 spaces.

13365,"Eins, Zwei, Drei",1976,6.2,5,1,2,5,10,10,,Memory ,Memory,"A quick memory game which consists of 8 disc like shallow cups that stack to form a tower. In the cup is a number, 1, 2 or 3. Each player has two chips and the aim is to move them onto a 1 disc, then from there onto a 2 disc and from there onto a 3 disc and then off.

First player to do this wins.

When the discs are stacked, only the number of the top one is visible and this disc is never in play. Each player in turn, breaks the stack somewhere to check the number. If it is a 1 you can place a chip on it, close the stack as you found it then break it somewhere (like a deck of cards, pick up half, place down, and put bottom half on top).

If, when you open the stack, you find a disc with your chip on it, you can break it a second time. If the second break reveals a disc 1 higher than the one your chip is on, you can move it. So, if you split the stack and find you chip on a 1 disc, you can split it again and if you find a 2 disc move the chip from the 1 to the 2. Either way you close the stack as you found it again and only if you moved a chip, break it somewhere again (to confuse others). If you reveal a disc on your first break which has your chip on a 3 you can remove it from the stack.

In this way you move chips from 1 to 2 to 3. Always trying to remember which discs you've seen and which you have not, and what's on them - in face of every successful player breaking the stack quickly and nimbly.

13370,Conquerors and Kings,1999,6.25,4,3,2,2,60,60,,Ancient Miniatures Wargame ,Area MovementDice Rolling,"Conquerers and Kings is a set of ancient rules based on the square bashing grid system pioneered by the Rules for the Common Man team.

The square bashing system, as it has been named, is a departure from normal miniature systems in that it imposes a seven by five square grid over the battlefield. This grid affects movement and combat - doing away with tedious millimeter measurements and allows the player to focus on maneuvering his units and rolling the dice. Squares can be either open (no impediment to movement) or closed (terrain impedes movement).

Troops are organized into units, and graded according to type (close order foot, open order foot, close order mounted, etc), quality (elite, veteran, trained, levy), and armor. The basic system is for units roll a number of dice (number determined by the abilities of the unit) to hit, and defenders roll dice to save the hits (if they have armor). Each unit may have up to four hit points.

The rules are published in a 36 page binder, and contains army lists for Sumer to the Mognols. In addition to the usual rules for terrain, movement, and combat, CK distinguishes itself by adding rules for the setting of the battle, by including pre-battle effects such as seizing key features on the battlefield prior to the battle, ambushes, and losing troops prior to the battle for various reasons.

13388,The Moscow Option: Guderian's Gambit,1996,6.11923,26,3,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"(from the introduction:)

The Moscow Option: Guderian's Gambit is a simulation of the fighting that could have taken place between Smolensk and Moscow during the first half of August 1941 if Hitler had decided to concentrate his eastern armies' supply in order to allow the mechanized forces of Army Group Center to make the 150 miles to the Soviet capital city. Historically, of course, the German dictator chose instead to halt the AGC, temporarily de-emphasizing Moscow as a target while diverting his forces' strength on the front's northern and southern sectors. Here we assume he chose instead to reorganize the mobile divisions of Panzer Groups 2 and 3 and ad hoc Panzer Army Guderian, putting that general in charge of a daring effort to take Moscow, thereby winning the war by plunging the entire Soviet Union into strategic paralysis.

This is a two-player, operational-level, alternative history wargame of low complexity. In it, the German player controls all Panzer Army Guderian units and is opposed by the Soviet player who controls all the Red Army units.

The situation is inescapably such that the German player controls the strategic initiative and sets the overall tempo of play. We therefore recommend opponents who share a particularly competitive relationship should play a series of matches, switching sides each time, before deciding who between them owns bragging rights to the game.

1 hex : 9 miles
GT : 1 day
Units : divisions and brigades (3000-12000 men and/or about 50 to 180 armored vehicles)

13399,The Planet Management Game,1971,4.5,2,2,2,10,0,0,,Economic Educational Environmental Science Fiction ,Co-operative PlaySimulation,"The Planet Management Game

Players have a high paying job with University Planet Management Associates. This team has been given the task of managing the planet Clarion for the next 50 years. Note that a Clarion year is much shorter than our own.

A brief history of Clarion (from the game manual)

The plant Clarion is much like the Earth in size, climate, and geography. However, the land area is smaller than the Earths. The living things on the planet are similar to plants and animals on Earth with one exception  there is no native animal like man.
      About 10 years ago the Council of Civilized Planets transported 100,000 colonists to Clarion from the planet Rasmuss. These colonists are similar to people, but are smaller. They have shorter life spans than people and look a little different, too. You could call them humanoids. Their food is similar to ours.
      The natural state of Clarion is like Earths before man began to change it. Some of the land is flat and has a mild climate that is good for farming. There are some deserts of purple sand. They are fiery hot during the day and cold at night. There are other regions of bare rock that separate the fertile areas. All the land is on one continent. The rest of the planet is a blue-green ocean much less salty than Earths.
      There seems to be only one major threat to life on Clarion  the disease Holobinkitis. It attacks both plants and animals, Clarionmen included. No one knows the cause of the disease or a cure for it. It is almost always fatal if you catch it.
      Clarion has one large and unusual mineral deposit. The mineral is Walterite ore. In fact, Clarion is the only known planet with such large deposits. Several scientists say that the metal obtained from the ore is superior to iron or steel for most uses. However, Walterite is usually found under a thick layer of hard rock. Thus, it is often difficult to mine.
      In comparison to Earth, Clarion has a low standard of living. The Clarionmen dont produce all the things need and want. As a result, they are thrifty. They dont like to spend money unless its absolutely necessary. Then they want to get a good deal: for every bit of money they spend.
      They have some of the same problems the Pilgrims had when they first settled in North America. Food sometimes becomes scarce, and it is expensive to import food from other planets. One of the big problems with raising crops is that the insects on Clarion really like to eat them. Therefore, a large part of every crop is lost to insects.
      Most of the Clarionmen say they will stay on in spite of the hardships. They believe Clarion has a bright future once things get going. The Clarionmen usually give three reasons for leaving their home planet of Rasmuss:
      1: It was getting too crowded there.
      2. There was a promise of a better life on Clarion.
      3, Clarion is a beautiful place to live.
Most Clarionmen have a strong appreciation for beauty, and they enjoy nature. They look forward to more leisure time outdoors.

End quote from game manual

As manager of Clarion, the players will keep track of four variables: population, income, food, and environment. They are given a budget of 10 bux (a Clarion buc is equivalent to about one million U.S. dollars) to fund planetary project for the next five years. Each budget will determine which projects Clarion will fund for the following five years. In the course of the complete game ten 5-year budgets will be prepared.

On turn one Clarions population index is at 100, each unit representing 1000 Clarion citizens. The income index and the food index also start at 100. When the population index equals income index, citizens have enough money to buy basic necessities. If income exceeds population, Clarion citizens standard of living will have improved. When the population index equals the food index there is enough food to provide each citizen with a well-balanced but simple diet. If food index falls below the population index, citizens are going hungry, perhaps even starving.

When humans first landed on Clarion, the environment index was 100. The air was pure, the oceans and river clean, the land beautiful. In the first years of colonizing Clarion, the environment index has decreased to 90. The population would like the environment restored so that environment index is at least as high as the population index. However, they would also like the income and food indices to increase relative to the population index as well.

For each budget, players have 10 bux to spend on projects. There are five different groups of projects that may be funded: red, blue, orange, yellow, and green. Each group (or color) contains three projects, only one of which may be funded. Each funded project may be funded for 2, 4, or 6 bux. Of course any group with no funded projects costs no bux.

Red (Agricultural Improvement projects)
1) Clear more land and prepare it for raising crops.
2) Import chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
3) Buy machinery to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops.

Blue (Scientific Research projects)
1) Conduct research to develop new varieties of corn, wheat, and rice with higher yields per acre.
2) Conduct research to identify the cause and cure of Holobinkitis.
3) Conduct research to find better ways to mine and use Walterite.

Orange (Industrial Expansion projects)
1) Build more Walterite mines and purification plants.
2) Build more highways and railroads to connect towns.
3) Construct new electric power plants.

Orange (Public Education projects)
1) Build more schools for all age groups and for general, professional, and technical education,
2) Pay people to go to graduate schools of civil engineering, biochemistry, medicine, and agriculture.
3) Finance the Einstein Plan: a) send a few of the most capable individuals to Earth for advanced study, and b) connect more Clarion homes to the educational television network.

Green (Industrial  Residential Pollution Control projects)
1) Construct more and improved treatment plants for city and factory waste.
2) Finance the Wright Plan: a) buy areas of land around lakes and oceans to be used for recreation, b) build mile-high apartment buildings surrounded by 100 acre parks in the center of cities.
3) Equip more chimneys of homes, industries, and other buildings with antismoke equipment.

The mechanics of playing this game:
A major part of this game is the 50 8 x 11 cards. These cards have a variety of small holes punched in them similar to early IBM punch cards. Each of the 15 possible projects has 3 cards: a 2 bux, a 4 bux, and a 6 bux card. And in case no project for a given color is funded, there is also a zero bux card for each of the five colors. To make their budget, the players select one card of each of five colors not to exceed their 10 bux limit. When the players have chosen their five cards, the five cards are stacked together revealing one (and only one) hole that is open in all of them.

The game also includes a data book. This book contains data pages for Population Change, Income Change, Food Change, and Environment Change for the different rounds of the game. For the first round of the game, the players turn to the Rounds 1  2 pages, where they are presented with four different population change pages.

It is almost quaint to realize that this game was made in the days before Dungeons  Dragons and the ready availability of four sided dice. The data book carefully explains how to flip a coin twice to generate a random number from 1 to 4.

The players then lay their group of five project cards on the randomly selected data sheet to determine how much that particular datum has changed. This process is followed for population, income, food, and environment changes. The final results are written down, and play advances to the next round.

To play round 2, players select another set of projects and proceed as they did in round 1, possible selecting different projects.

As play progresses through rounds 3 - 10, the appropriate pages of the data book are used. Blank graphs are provided to help players visualize the results of their chosen projects.

The game is completed at the end of 10 rounds. The players are then asked if they think the citizens of Clarion would be pleased with the state of their planet at the end? Did their team mange Clarion well? Could the same results have been achieved with less money?

After playing the game, the management team should decide how well it did. If they play the game again, they can try to do better. They can decide what is better. Comparing the results with those of another team, who did the better job. Here are some things to think about in deciding a winner or which job of Planet Management was best:
1) Were the same results obtained by spending less money?
2) Which set of final index values would you prefer to live with?
3) Do food and income indices compare favorably with the population index?
4) If things continued to change in the same way for another fifty years, would Clarion be a good place to live?

11x17 map, 264 counters (some of these are variant counters for Zaporozhye 1943), 12 pages of rules (translated fairly well into English). Each turn is 3 hours (day) or 4 hours (dusk, night, dawn), each hex is 960m. Units range from companies to brigades, with the Soviets having larger units.

Game uses an IGO-HUGO system with opportunities for the non-phasing player to take defensive anti-tank fire. There are 3 kinds of combat: barrage, anti-tank (done by firepower) and assault (done by odds ratio). Combat results are disruptions, morale checks (yielding retreats), step losses and eliminations.

The Kustrin scenario is the smaller of the 2 and lasts 12 turns. It uses fewer counters than Seelow and is more of a learning scenario.

For the Seelow scenario, there are 12 turns - there is a chance the game can end after turn 7, otherwise the action continues 5 more turns.

Can they even hear them? Do they form line of battle, or do they fall prone? Do they Hold and Volley Fire, or do they recklessly Charge?

A series of Track Cards are laid out to form a road that acts as the game board. Players are dealt 4 Number Cards and a number of Vehicle Markers depending on the number of players. On a turn, a player places a Vehicle Marker on the next empty Track Card and follows the directions on the card. These allow you to draw a Number Card, ask another player for a specific type of Number Card, or to look at another player's hand and take the Number Card you want. If you have a pair of matching numbers, you place them in the discard pile and go again. Instead of placing a Vehicle Marker on the next Track Card, you may instead give it to another player. The game ends when someone plays their last Vehicle Marker, or when the End Card is reached on the track, in which case the player with the fewest Markers wins.

Although it is a simple game, it does have the basic mechanics of a modern football board game. The main difference is that the player on Defense does not also call a play to match up with play called by the Offensive player before the results are determined.

The game board depicts an entire 18 hole golf coarse with tees, greens, fairways, and hazards. The fairways have lines marked on them to indicate yardage. Each player has a ball pin to indicate their locations on a hole. A deck of cards is used to indicate the results of a swing.

On a turn a player calls out the club he is using, choosing from a (very 1920s) selection of: Driver, Brassie, Midiron, Mashie, Mashie-Niblick, Niblick, Putter. The player then turns over the top card, consults the club he called, and moves his pin down the fairway the amount of yards indicated. Some cards indicate a poor swing by declaring the ball out of bounds or in the rough. A ball landing in a hazard has a limited club selection for its next shot. For example, a ball in the rough can only be played with a Mashie, a Mashie-Niblick, or a Niblick. When a player's yardage generated equals the yardage of the hole, he has holed out.

Since this is an old game that was published before stroke play became the standard, the winner is the player who won the most holes (match play).

He then reads aloud the name of the State he landed on, the year it was admitted to the Union, and (without looking at the map) the State's Capital. If he names the Capital correctly he may keep the Flag or Token. If the player is incorrect he moves backwards to the first vacant space. If he spins a 1776 or a Statue of Liberty he moves forward to the next space with a flag or token and, if he correctly names the Capital, may spin again. The game ends when a player reaches the last space. All players add up their scores - Flags are worth 10 points, tokens are worth 1 point - and the highest score wins.

It is not your typical game expansion, but is a completely new game, with several new rules, and potentially new strategies. It is built on the firm foundation of the original game and should be a quick learn for experienced players.

There are two main changes to the game: The map is now a 4 by 6 grid tiles representing Germany, and the Directorship, that is, who owns the track is determined by who transported the most players for a company, not who bought the most shares. Additionally, being Director means that you get 5 dice in income during your turn, and not 4 dice.

These two changes alone should make for a very interesting game.

It must be said that the game does not include any new dice. The standard set of dice in the original game has not been expanded. Some of the same rules apply: You only build or lay track on one or two tiles, as soon as you leave a tile, the track dice are removed and the station dice are left behind.

New terrain features are rivers with special crossing rules for them, and that you can only build stations in specific locations indicated on the map. When you build a station at that location, you get the number of passengers for that station, 3,000 or 5,000, plus an additional 1,000 for every share symbol or question mark die you spend. This makes it easier for a player to get back into the game if they have fallen behind.

Salvage Hunt: Be the first player to pick up, one at a time and in the correct order, the anchor, cannon, pistol, sextant, and lantern. The Sea Diver is passed from player to player, each getting one attempt, until a winner is determined.

Drop Anchor: A player brings the anchor to the top of the bottle, releases it, and tries to catch it before it touches the bottom. The player earns 1 point for each successful catch. The winner is the player with the most points after 10 tries.

You are all members of Grimaldi Moon Base staff, who manage instruments and observatories around the lunar surface. A swarm of meteoroids has hit the Moon, and the remote sensors report damage to some of the instruments. Your team must go out from Grimaldi Moon Base and retrieve the damaged instruments before the Sun sets. You've got more time than you think. On the Moon's surface it is light for 15 days and then dark for 15 days.

Some of the instruments are damaged more badly than others and will require 2 or more rovers to meet at the instrument to retrieve it. Only by working together -- sharing resources and making joint plans -- can you succeed in your mission to get back as many damaged instruments as possible before the long lunar night falls. As you make plans, remember that your number one goal is the safety of your team. Be sure to get everyone back before dark or you lose.

Players place the 4 marbles of their color on any of the holes. For a turn, a player spins the spinner and, if it points to one of his marbles, removes the marble from the circular track and places it in one of the holes in the corner of his color. If it points to another player's marble, the other player removes the marble and places it in his corner. If it points to either of the two gray penalty spaces, the player who spun must put back on the track a marble that he has captured. The first player to gather all four of his marbles into his corner wins the game.

The game also comes with alternate rules in which a player calls out a color and then spins. If the spinner points to a marbles who's color matches the color called the player places it in his corner. In this version the first player to fill his corner with one red, one blue, one green and one yellow marble wins.

Mostly luck, the game combines a spinner (arrow) with the mechanics of roulette = Arrowlette.

13476,Army Air Corps,1942,0,0,0,2,5,30,30,,Aviation / Flight World War II ,,"This game, published during WWII, demonstrates the various phases of Army Air Corps training. The board has three training sections - Primary, Basic and Advanced, respectively indicated by Red, White and Blue coloring. The spaces of each section contain a number and a picture of various tasks and skills that a recruit needs to master.

At the start of the game, players spin the spinner and place one of their markers on the Primary Training space as spun on the Red Circle. If the player has already covered the space, he may take 1 extra spin per turn. When a player has covered all the Primary spaces he enters the Basic Training section and uses the White circle on the spinner. When he finishes Basic Training he moves to the Advanced Training spaces and uses the Blue Circle.

If a player covers 3 spaces in a row he may play an additional marker on any space still open to him in that section. Markers left in the Primary Section may also be used by adding the number on the marker's space to the number spun on the spinner. If the sum of these 2 numbers equals the number of an empty space in the section the player is working on he may move the Primary marker to cover the open space. The first player to cover all the spaces in the Advanced Training section is the first to graduate, and wins the game.

13479,Wings: The Air Mail Game,1928,4.4,5,1.3333,2,4,10,10,,Aviation / Flight Card Game Industry / Manufacturing Racing Transportation ,Card DraftingHand ManagementPick-up and Deliver,"This old game from Parker Brothers has mechanics similar to Touring, which is about 25 years older. Lindy, the New Flying Game was a straightforward re-theme of Touring to airplanes delivering airmail. Wings is more of a twist since it has 2 decks of cards--a red deck of Mail Cards, and a blue deck of Delay/Release cards. The Mail cards each depict a city on the players routes. These cities are all numbered and must be played in the correct sequence. For example, #1 Boston must be played before #2 New York, which must be played before #3 Philadelphia and so on until reaching #12 San Francisco. Delay/Release cards either help or hinder the player, or his opponents.

Players are dealt 5 Mail Cards. A player starts his turn by drawing a Mail Card and playing as many cities in sequence as possible. He then draws cards to refill his hand and may play new cards drawn if they continue his city sequence. When he can no longer play red cards he draws 1 card from the blue deck and follows its instructions. These range from High Speed Cards which allow him an extra turn, to Delay Cards which he plays on an opponent; the opponent must play a Release Card before he can add to his city sequence.

The first player to deliver the mail to San Francisco finishes his route and wins.

The plane with registration number N-X-211 pictured on the cards was Charles Lindberg's plane The Spirit of St. Louis. Linderberg did fly for the air mail Service, but not in the The Spirit of St. Louis. The plane was also never marked with Air Mail on the tail.

A spinner is used to determine a random color. Then a dial is turned clockwise to the same color spun revealing a picture in a window. If Bambi or Thumper is revealed, the respective player moves one space. If they are running, two spaces are moved. If both characters are shown, the player that is behind moves their pawn to the space occupied by the leader. Shortcut spaces help speed the players along. The winner is the first player to jump the log and land on a win space. In the advanced game, the winner is the first player to collect 4 Clover Pieces, either by dialing one in the window or by landing on a clover space. In this version, the players may have to circle the board several times before a winner is determined.

The game board has an outer ring of spaces (like Monopoly) and paths leading to a center space (the Hideout) where the Baretta pawn starts. Each player selects a criminal that he wants Baretta to catch and takes its matching Baretta Captures card. The deck of cards is then shuffled and a card is placed on all the outer ring spaces (except the corner Location spaces). The remaining cards are then dealt to the players who then shuffle in their Baretta Captures card to the cards they received to form their own draw pile.

On a turn, a player rolls the dice and moves Baretta in any one direction the amount rolled. If he lands on a space with a card, he turns the card over and follows the directions (usually moving him an extra amount of spaces or to a specific location). If he lands on an outer ring space without a card, the player draws the top card from his pile, looks at it, places it on the empty space, and marks it with a token of his color. Eventually players will start placing their Baretta Captures cards on the board and the first player to move Baretta onto his Capture card wins. So players are constantly trying to move the Baretta pawn away from cards marked by opponents and towards their own capture cards.

As prizes are offered for the fastest shopper, the player who reaches the sidewalk in front of the store (in the company of some other family member of the family) is usually the winner.

Each player is dealt 6 cards and a standard trick-taking round follows. The high card of the suit led wins all the other cards played. After the round, all players draw a new card from the deck to bring their hands back up to 6. Play continues until the draw deck depleted and the players have played all the cards in their hands. Players then score 1 point for each Zip Code card they have won. The first player to score 50 points wins the game (this may take several rounds).

The contestant calls upon the others, one at a time, to add their value to the jackpot as long as the contestant can solve the riddles posed. The contestant changes places with riddler who stumped the contestant. When the Jackpot riddle is exposed, the contestant and the riddler split the jackpot if the riddle is solved. When the last three digits of the jackpot match the target number, the Super Jackpot is won by the contestant if the riddle is solved.

Another round begins when the jackpot riddle is revealed. The number of rounds played is equal to the number of players in the game. The player with most money is the winner.

The game is faithful adaptation of a television series. Two different versions of the box art exist. One has the game logo on the cover; the other shows a jubilant woman in front of the logo. Both boxes contain the same game.

Tiles played to the table must be connected in such a way that the tracks are joined correctly and the winding train grows longer with each play. A tile may not be placed so that the track turns back upon itself preventing another tile from being added. At first, players may add tiles to both ends of the train. When an engine or caboose is drawn, it must be added to the front or back respectively, thus reducing plays to only one side. When the train has both an engine and a caboose, the game ends. Players count all the cars of their color on the train, and the one with the most cars wins.

13519,Crusade,2004,0,0,0,2,2,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"Crusade - This is the next generation of board games.

What is it?
Crusade is an exciting 2-player board game that is also a three-dimensional card game. If you or anyone you know likes playing card games or thought provoking board games then this is an absolute must-have. Designed with adults in mind it makes a great present for a wide range of ages and will keep both players intrigued every time they play. A typical game lasts about 15~20 minutes so you'll never get bored, you'll never play the same game twice and it really is never over until the last turn of the card. It has very few rules, but for those who prefer not to read rules at all or to have to explain them to new players, each game comes complete with a short 10 minute/side audio-cassette. Side one gives full instructions and an explanation of how to set up the playing pieces, how they move and why. Side two gives simple strategies enough to take you through your first exciting game. Play it once and you've learned it, but it takes memory, luck and cunning to become a really great player. The unique assembly of the playing area and rigid storage box will allow you to play on a full size board, yet when packed away the game is so compact you can take it, or store it, almost anywhere. It is ideal for use in the home, on boats and in caravans. Games are only available direct from the manufacturer and can be ordered by credit card on the secure Internet site or by Fax, Phone and Post.

Crusade had been in development for over 10 years before it was put into production, during that period it was extensively tested and refined, into what we believe is now the most exciting 2-player board game ever. It really is the most addictive game you will ever play, the logo 'never just a game' says it all, we've not met anyone yet who has just played one game and put it back in it's box!

The concept was to create a brand new game that had a timeless theme, a game that could stand the test of time in the same manner as Chess and Checkers (Draughts) this would mean the game could not be linked to any film or television characters as they could only date the game to their own popularity. The game would be designed to be user friendly and instantly familiar, as soon as the first game had been played the contestants should feel as though they have been able to play it all their lives. But in order to keep the players interest, the more times the game would be played the greater the thought would need to go into each move. There should be no complicated rules, the game should flow naturally requiring variations in strategy through a series of constant decisions presented by multiple choices and allow for changes in tactics and objectives as various options and opportunities arose.
The playing arena had to be unique, it was required to be robust but light and of a sufficiently large size to make it have a real presence when in use, yet when dismantled the board needed to be compact and take up as little storage space as possible. The board would also to be designed with the facility of integrating a personalized advertising panel allowing corporate customers to promote their company along side the playing area.
The playing pieces would need to be clearly distinguishable and easy to use as this game would not only be played by adults but also by the young and the elderly.
The traditional problem of explaining rules and strategies to new player would be overcome by including in each game box, in addition to the standard explanation leaflet, an audio-tape of not longer than 10 minutes per side that would explain every aspect of the game and allow instant play.

In the beginning.
We started by examining existing board games and listed their strengths and weaknesses. Probably the most universally well-known board game is Chess; it's been around for over 2000 years so it's certainly stood the test of time. However, great game though it undoubtedly is, it does have basic weaknesses; it's difficult to learn to play well, and a player needs an opponent who is on the same level in order to produce a good contest, a novice or a grand master will provide little entertainment to an average player. Another major factor is, it's enough to give you a headache trying to think all those moves ahead, we wanted a game where you could laugh and joke while you played, our game had to be fun, serious fun. We wanted certain elements of Chess but without the complexity and the seriousness. We accepted that one of the great strengths of Chess was that it allowed for changes in strategy throughout the game and although the game could get very involved, there were actually very few rules. Once you knew how the pieces moved and their relative values that was enough to get you started. Another great strength was the layout of the playing area, very simple and mathematically perfect.
The next choice was to choose what would be the driving force of the game, what made the pieces move. Many traditional board games use dice to determine the moves, well that again we saw that as a weakness, luck plays a very big part in dice games, meaning there is very little skill involved in relation to chance. We decided that a standard pack of playing cards would determine which playing piece moved in Crusade they would give infinitely more permutations to their order of play than dice, as well as the fact that a pack of playing cards is familiar to everyone.

Armed with this basic criteria for a new game we stripped out all the other aspects linked with existing board games that we considered not acceptable so:

Out went the boring type of game that seems to go on for days, but you can tell who's going to win after the first half hour.
Excitement is built in to Crusade, it's a quick, yet thought provoking game. Each game will last on average about 15-20 minutes and you'll need memory, luck and cunning in order to become a great player.

Out went the endless pages of rules; so complicated and ambiguous that you spent more time reading them than playing the game and the difficulties of explaining to new players what a game is all about is also resolved.
Crusade has very few rules; it's based more on an understanding of the playing pieces objectives and how they move around the board. Play it once and you've learned it, perhaps the strangest thing is, in no time at all, you'll feel you've played it all your life. To help you learn to play in minutes and to explain the game to new players, each game comes complete with a short audio-cassette. Side 1 explains how to set out the pieces, how they move and why, and how to play the game. Side 2 provides hints on strategies and details a full demonstration game.

Out went the old fashioned cardboard playing area with the unsightly crease down the center, that folded away into a weird long flat box, which you couldn't seem to store anywhere.
Crusade has a sturdy four piece high quality molded game-board that twists together in seconds to produce a full size playing arena, yet when dismantled it packs away into a specially designed box that gives maximum protection with compact storage. Approximate dimensions in mm. 316L x 162W x 60D (like a shoe box but about half as deep) with a weight of less than 1 kilogram. This makes Crusade not only a fantastic game to keep at home but also the ideal game for use in boats and caravans, where space is at a premium.

Out went the problem of finding a group of people to play with you.
Crusade has been designed to be a 2-player game, because it's far easier to find one person to play with rather than getting together the 4 or 6 people required for some types of board games. Opponents can also be drawn from a vast age range. We recommend it is suitable from 8 years old to Adult, however many below 8 years old can pick up the idea of the game within minutes, as have the many people in their 80's who now enjoy playing. There's a simple handicapping system that allows an expert to have an interesting and exciting game with a complete novice, but nobody stays a novice for long. Even playing with people who do not speak your language is not a barrier; the game becomes self-explanatory by just watching it being played. You will become familiar with Crusade quite literally within minutes, you can play time and time again but you'll never play the same game twice. Each game is a new challenge and throughout the game, even if at times your position doesn't look strong, you still have a chance of winning right up to the very end. It's totally absorbing and never over until the last card is played.

13521,Bird Watcher,1958,0,0,0,2,4,30,30,,Animals Educational ,Roll / Spin and Move,"This is an old Parker Brothers track game where players learn to identify various species of birds. The game board depicts various paths running through the countryside. Bird cards are shuffled and dealt onto the 12 sight locations indicated by bird silhouettes.

On a turn, you spin the spinner and follow the result. If it is a number, you move along the paths the number of spaces indicated. If you spin the word Fly, you move any stack of bird cards to any other sight location (usually away from an opponent and closer to you). If you spin the word Flock,  you collect one bird card from all the stacks. If you spin the words Short Cut, you may move your piece to any space on the board. When you land on a blue space adjacent to a stack of bird cards, you may take half the cards in the stack (rounded down) and keep them. When all the cards have been removed from the board, players turn over the bird cards in their possession and add up the numbers on the back. The highest total wins.

For an advanced game, players are required to identify the bird depicted on the card before taking possession of it.

The suit cards run from 1 to 11 (there is no A4 or A9). The entire deck is dealt out to the players. The player to the left of the dealer starts by laying down any card from his hand. The player who holds the next higher card in the suit (regardless of where they sit at the table) must follow, laying the card down on the table (D4 followed by D5 for example). Then whoever holds the next higher card plays that, thus continuing in sequence (unless blocked) until the high card of the suit is reached.

Whoever plays the high card (or blocks) gains the Lead, and starts a new sequence by playing any suit card from his hand, thus getting rid of two of his cards. If you have a Block card and you wish to block a sequence, you play the next card in the sequence paired with the Block card. You then Lead the next sequence, thus getting rid of three of your cards. As the hand continues, natural blocks occur due to players leading with cards in the middle of suits. The player who plays the A5 or the A10 card wins an immediate 5 or 10 points respectively.

When a player plays his last card, the hand ends, and that player receives 1 point for every card left in the other player's hands. He also scores 5 or 10 points if the A5 or the A10 cards remain unplayed. A player still holding a Block card loses 5 points as a penalty. The first player to score 100 points wins.

13527,Monstret som slukade Stockholm,1983,4.65385,26,2,2,2,45,45,,Fighting Horror Humor ,Area MovementDice Rolling,"				
					Theme and General concept


A rough translation of the title would be The Monster that devoured Stockholm.

Being a thematic sibling of The Creature That Ate Sheboygan, this game is original enough not to be considered a rip-off. It is part of the early 1980s board game offerings put out by Target Games.

				
					Gameplay


The mapboard is actually a rather accurate map of Stockholm, divided into areas of different sizes that regulate movement. Dividing the center of the board is a streak of water, Stockholms strm, which is impassable to human forces but not to the monster. Certain areas are also spawn points of police and military forces, that randomly enter the fight against the monster as reinforcements each turn. There are also civilian counters, i.e. monster food.

The objective of the game is, for the monster player, to destroy a certain well-known landmark in Stockholm, including the old Tax ministry headquarters, the degenerate statue group Paradiset, the Royal castle et al. Before the game starts, the monster players chooses from a set of monster statistics that include which landmark it is to destroy, and also determines the monster start area. The objective of the human player is simply to kill the monster.

Rules chrome includes the then renowned skinhead gangs of Stockholm that in the game are portrayed as violent, unkillable, and anarchist -- they randomly change allegiance each turn -- as well as the ceremonial palace guard, Hgvakten, at Stockholm Castle.

				
					Introduction from the rules


The following is a translation of the Swedish introduction from the rules:

The Monster that devoured Stockholm is an exciting adventure game where tactics and good foresight are of great importance.

The game is played by two players.  One is the monster-player who tries to destroy a certain part of Stockholm.  The other player is the human-player and controls Stockholms' military and police forces.

The monster will try to reach its destination without being killed by defending humans. On its way, the monster may eat innocent citizens to regain its strength.

The human player must try to figure out where the monster is heading and concentrate his military forces there while trying to reduce the casualties from innocent bystanders to a minimum.

				
					Components


The box contains:
1 Gaming board 39x52cm
2 Dice
1 set of 60 cardboard counters

(The rules is the only part of the game with Swedish text).

The player to the dealer's left starts by playing any card between 1 and 10 from his hand to the center of the table. The next player must either play a card from the same Patrol whose number is 1 greater or 1 less than the card on the table, or play a card from a different Patrol whose number is the same. For example, if an Owl 4 card is led, the next player may play an Owl 3 below it, an Owl 5 above it, or a 4 card from a different patrol (say a Wolf 4) adjacent to it (thus allowing Wolf cards to be played). The lead card designates the number that all other patrols must start on (in this example number 4). If a player has no legal play he must pass. The first player to play his last card scores points equal to the numbers on all the cards still in the other players hands. A Patrol Leader card counts as 15 points for scoring. The first player to score 250 points wins.

According to the Dutch rules from publisher Goliath Games, the number of Patrols used in a game is equal to the number of players (e.g. only use 3 Patrols in a three player game).

13571,Dr. Busby,1840,0,0,0,4,5,20,20,,Card Game Memory ,Memory,"Dr. Busby is the first game to sell so many copies, that it is considered as having started the game craze in the United States.

HISTORY:
According to the March 7, 1843 Salem Gazette newspaper, The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby was first published by W.  S. B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts and went on sale that date. In the May 1843 Boys and Girls magazine, the components of the first edition were described: a gold embossed thumb-hole cloth (maroon) case with printed instructions card (yellow) and four sets of 5 cards, each set outlined in a different color: brown for the Busby family, red for the Doll (the dairymaid) family, yellow for the Ninny-come-twitch family, and blue for the Gardner's family.

S(tephen). B. Ives continued to hold the Ives' games copyrights after he and his brother William dissolved the business in April, 1854 (as mentioned in William's newspaer, The Salem Observer).

Stephen's son, Henry P. Ives partnered with A. Augustus Smith to take over the business until Henry bought Smith out in 1861 according to the 1861 Salem directory.

Stephen, his son Henry, and elder son David (with a dry goods business in Boston) continued to publish the game until 1887 when the last remaining Ives' family member, Henry, sold the copyrights to George S. Parker.

During the interimum, editions were printed by the Ives' family with Milton Bradley labels, Henry P. Ives and Selchow  Righter labels, S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow labels, and S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow and E. I. Horseman labels.

According to a letter many publishers were associated with Dr. Busby until 1886 but they really were purchasing and reselling Ives' published games.

In the 1890's McLoughlin Brothers ignored the copyright and put out there own version as did many other major American game manufacturers. That is why you see so many publishers of Dr. Busby in the 1890s.

George S(winterton) Parker made grandiose claims about the games he published which lead to a number of mistakes by historians who failed to go back to the primary sources when describing the history of Dr. Busby.

Consequently,  sParker Brothers rulebook...

This game was the first ever published in America, being brought out of Salem in 1840.

Anne Wales Abbot may have first made a prototype of Dr. Busby in 1840 but there are no primary sources to prove this is the case. It may be because the first edition that was published by W.  S. B. Ives is called The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby. Before that published edition with an 1843 copyright, no other earlier editions have been found with or without a copyright date.

George S. Parker, in his 1895 edition of the board game, The Mansion Of Hapiness, made another incorrect claim. The game box cover states that The Mansion Of Happiness was the first board game published in America. There are at least three copies of F.  R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through The United States (copyright 1882) and one copy of F. . R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through Europe in private and museum collections. So Parker was wrong in this claim too.

RULES:
The game consists of 20 cards, divided into 4 families: the Busby Family, the Dairymaid's Family, the Ninnycometwitch Family, and the Gardener's Family. Each family has 5 members, for example the Busby Family consists of Dr. Busby, his Wife, Son, Servant and Dairymaid's black-eyed Lover.

The starting player begins by asking the player on his right for any card not in his own hand. If that player has the card he calls for, he gives it to him and the starting player may call for another card and so on until he calls for a card which the player doesn't have. Then the next player takes his turn, but must first call for those cards which have been called for and obtained by the first player. Thus it becomes a game of memory since any incorrect call ends a turn. When a player has called every card from the player on the right (thus putting that player out of the game), he may continue to call from the next player on the right. At the end of the game, the winner will have successfully called all the cards into his own hand.

13574,VerkehrsChaos,1994,6.9,5,3,2,4,30,30,,,Area Movement,"The board represents a city and has 4 roads on it with 3 intersections. The player has 12 cars which he has to move along the board as quickly as possible. The trouble is that you can't pass another car so you get traffic jams. A player can also give the opponent a flat tire.
 The player who gets his cars off the board first, wins the game.

The prototype of the game was called Stau!, which means traffic-jam. It had player-aids representing parking-spaces to hold a player's cars, these were omitted in the production version.

13575,Bunny Zick-Zack,1991,5.5,9,0,2,6,15,15,,Racing ,Betting/Wagering,"This Doris and Frank game is closely related to Eselsrennen. Differences are - only a one sided board which supports a three bunny (pawn) race. The mechanics are pretty much the same:

Players are given a card secretly, each showing the bunny's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the bunnies. When you move a bunny onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green bunny one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue bunny on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final bunny because it is blocked or it lands on a space of its own color. Eventually, the bunnies cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins.

Funny and quick puzzle-racing game and one of the (if not the) first games published by Doris and Frank.

13579,Öko,1980,4.5,6,0,2,6,60,60,,Dice Economic Educational Political ,Dice Rolling,"In this game, players strive for the best quality of life. There are different parameters - health, income and possibilities for personal development. 
The game board contains a circuit that players roll and move around. Different fields trigger different events or actions, such as choosing a job, buying a house or a car, environmental problems appearing, etc. Each player has markers on the scales for the three parameters, but the society at large (all players) also live in certain conditions, represented by low resources, a bad environment, etc. Depending on these, the actions of the players are evaluated differently. For instance, a player who buys a car pays money out of his/her income, gains personal possibilities but lowers his/her health. Depending on the environmental situation of all players, more or less points are deducted at the end of a turn.

A player who has completed a circuit places evaluation markers on his/her current situation. When all players have completed the circuit, the points are compared, and the player(s) with the best score in each of the three aspects gains points. After a premediated number of turns, the player with the highest overall number of points is the winner.

Naturally, the words on the cards are sexually suggestive.

All 3 decks are shuffled together. The highest card drawn acts as dealer.

Seven cards are dealt to each player. The remainder make up the draw pile.

Starting with the dealer, each player lays down a card. Each player must add a word to the sentence. All tenses must be assumed i.e. kiss can be kissed, kisses or kiss.

If a player cannot use any words from their hand they must draw until they can.

A sentence is deemed ended when it stands as a complete sentence and the next player cannot add another word to it. The player ending the sentence starts the next sentence.

The winner is the player who uses their last dirty word and runs out of cards.

Play several rounds as the game goes quickly.

13585,The North Atlantic Shipping Game,1980,5.5,2,0,2,4,0,0,,Economic Nautical Transportation ,Pick-up and Deliver,"Its a game for 2 - 4 players in which you run your own container shipping line. You may decide to be a Conference line or an Independent line.

You may decide to sail from Northport, Southport or Gulfport. You may decide to accept cargo, pass, or bid competitively for it.

Every day on the North Atlantic, ships cross the ocean, carrying American cago for sale in Europe. A week or so later, these same ships are unloaded and refilled with containers of European goods, which are brought back to America.

Some of the shipping lines belong to a Conference, an association in which all members agree to charge the same rates and do business in an identical way to other Conference members. Some shipping lines remain Independent, which means they set their own rates (generally slightly lower than Conference rates) and do business in a way they feel is best for them and their customers.

Some ships sail from Northern parts, and others sail from Southern or Gulf Coast parts, where the weather at sea is generally calmer.

Shipping lines naturally prefer to carry cargo which pays the highest rate and often bid against each other to win an account. If they lose the bid, sometimes they must sail with an empty container. Some lines prefer to carry lower-priced cargo since they would rather have a lower profit than no profit at all, which is the case when you have to sail with an empty container.

In the real world, of course, there are many more things to consider when you own a shipping line. We describe them in the pages following these rules. But the concepts referred to above are what you will be concerned with when you play...

The object of the game is to get rid of your Bunco pile.

On your turn you must first play any #1 cards in your hand or Bunco pile. These are placed in the center of the table to form the piles that you play your cards on. You then play cards from your hand or Bunco pile in numerical sequence onto the table piles; 2s go on 1s, 3s go on 2s etc. Bunco cards are wild and can be used for any number. If you run out of cards in your hand, you draw a new hand of 5 cards. When you can no longer play a card, your turn ends and the next player goes. If you have a Stop Card, you may play it at any time during another player's turn and take the turn to play. The first player to play all the cards in their Bunco pile wins.

13587,Presidential Poker,2004,9,1,0,1,10,0,0,,Bluffing Card Game Political ,Betting/Wagering,"A wild Hold'em variation played with a richly illustrated deck of comic cards containing humorous images of the personalities and issues that contested the 2004 presidential election.

Each card contains a unique Swing Vote that introduces a new rule to the current poker hand and cleverly relates to the funny illustration, nickname, and political caption on the card.  The card names and humor will remind game geeks and political wonks of cards and news events from their favorite boardgames and presidential campaigns.   The Hanging Chad card, for example, allows the second best hand to win the pot, the Patriot Act forces every player to reveal one of their hidden cards, the National Insecurity Adviser randomly redistributes the hole cards, and the FCC card penalizes the next player to curse.  Each suit represents a different political point of view and poker term: the Hearts are the Pro-Kerry Boston Studs, the Diamonds the pro-Bush Texas Holdems, the Clubs the Anti-Kerry Flip Floppers, and the Spades are the Anti-Bush Dummy Hands.

Can used to play any standard playing card game and is intended to provide as much value for the comedic commentary and art as the game play.  Fantastic contemporary illustrations produced by hip-hop artist Cojo and veteran political cartoonist R.J. Matson.

Presidential Poker 2012 will be published mid-year 2012 with entirely new personality and issue cards and a more strategic rule set.

The expansion generated controversy because the rules for it were printed in the rulebook that came with the base game, leading some consumers to claim that part of the game was left out.

A seemingly common misunderstanding is the assumption that this extension enables players to play until the end of the battle; as a matter of fact, this expansion does not even reach the date the Soviet counter offensive started historically: The extended game ends November 14 (as opposed to October 3 in the base game), which is roughly a week before the Soviets began their offensive to encircle the German 6th army at Stalingrad. In other words, the extension covers more, but still not all of the German offensive part of the battle.

Paralyzed with fear in a state of mass confusion, you struggle desperately to make sense of what's just happened. Then you realize you've been Left Behind! Based on the Best Seller this game, like the movie, has two exciting parts. The first is prior to the Rapture and the second is after the Rapture. It is the classic contest between good and evil. In the first part of the game, the players' task is to answer questions correctly or even deceive other players with false confessions and earn Left Behind Tokens. These tokens are of great value in the second part of the game (which starts without warning). This is when Carpathia enters the game and causes individual players to band together forming the Tribulation Force. From this moment on, the goal is to work together to defeat Carpathia or face elimination. This unique game can give players a heightened awareness of the end times.

For example, the Thermometer tip is inserted into Charlie's mouth and pressed until the window pops open, or a slide is inserted into the X-Ray machine and a light is switched on to reveal the picture.

The game is a modification of the game Alquerque which was brought to the New World by the Spaniards. Boards for the game were found cut into the flat stone roofs of the Zuni houses, which were used as terraces.

The game is played on a special board of three parallel horizontal lines intersected by a number of left and right leaning diagonals across the width of the board. At each end a line curves around joining each corner point to a point at the end of the middle line.

Each player uses 23 pebbles or pottery fragments as pieces. The object is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. Captures are made by jumping, and more than one piece can be captured at a time. Capturing is compulsory.

This game is similar to Alquerque, and Awithlaknannai, though the latter uses fewer spaces on the board.

What is ROOSTERTAIL? Title of the game is taken from the term fans, sportswriters and broadcasters apply to the huge plume of water rising to 20 feet which the hydroplane churns in the air as it races across the water's surface at speeds up to 200 miles per hour. Rules, hazards and bonuses of the game are based on hydroplane racing which annually draws hundreds of thousands of spectators to such events as the Gold Cup: Seattle Seafair Trophy race on Lake Washington; President's Cup: Potomac River, Washington, D.C.; Silver Cup: Detroit River, Detroit Michigan; Apple Cup: Lake Chelan, Washington; Governor's Cup: Madison, Indiana; Sahara Cup: Lake Mead, Nevada, and many others.

The Game's components consist of the following:
A plain, narrow cardboard Box bottom, with a matching WHITE Box Top with Roostertail! in RED print, The Hydroplane Racing Game... in Dark BLUE print and a colorful picture of (3)-Hydros with accompanying 'roostertails'! The 'Roostertail Rules' are around a 1/2 size sheet of paper printed on BOTH sides and folded over. Very concise indeed. There are a couple of DICE for rolling to conduct movement,  (4)-metal cast 'Hydros'(with pluming Roostertails!) in RED, BLUE, GREEN,  ORANGE; a nicely mounted Gameboard 14-3/4-inches by 16-1/8-inches; a few Scoring Sheets(about 1/4 size of a paper sheet); a Deck of HAZARDS Cards; and a Deck of BONUS Cards.

The gameboard playing surface consists of (4)-lanes of mainly WHITE 'squares' in a rectangular fashion, with a WHITE print on BLACK Starting Line, many YELLOW Hazards squares intermingled along the 'Lanes', and Dead in the Water squares at the corners, with a portion of the gameboard reserved for the Pit area, the 'Scoring' Table, and places for the CARDS. There is also the same 'picture' in the center section as what is found on the Box Top, with the notable addition of 'corner buoys' in the corners(where else?), these come into play with some of the 'Hazards' CARDS.

Each 'Heat' consists of (3)-laps around the board and then scoring is adjusted for the outcomes. You can call your 'boat' anything you wish as long as you write it's name down, while the 'Hazard' CARDS depict events that could occur when engaged in such an endeavor(such as Oil Leak, Missed Buoy, Debris, etc.), and the 'BONUS' Cards usually allow for EXTRA movements that you will get when you roll DOUBLES! There is even a Flying Start before each 'Heat', to get the game going with to determine who begins in which 'Lane' during the ensuing 'Race' . Allowances for 'passing' into another LANE are permitted, but NO diagonal Movements, or 'jumping' are allowed! They have willingly 'dismissed' the notion of 'collisions', for ease of play no doubt. If you happen to get 'boxed in', then you are stuck and LOSE your Turn! Quite a nice little gem of a game for it's time(mid 1950s!), if I do say so myself!

Game 1: Atomic Challenge
In this game players use the marbles to simulate electrons, protons, and neutrons as they build and identify different atoms. The objective is to be the first player to use all of your marbles.

Game 2: Nuclear Reactions
In this more advanced game, players score points by building neutral atoms, stable nuclei, and complete atoms that are both neutral and stable.

Game 3: Photons and Lasers
This game teaches players how light is emitted and absorbed by atoms. The object of the game is to score points by playing cards and moving electrons up and down energy shell levels. Pump cards build the atom up to excited states, ready for scoring. Laser cards allow players to strategically move electrons down, scoring points, and simulating the emission of light from a real atom.

These games would work for grades 4-12 in an educational setting.

In recent years, there has been much work performed in the field of naval archeology. The launching of the reconstructed trireme Olympias has also provided a great deal of information on the performance of ancient oared warships. These rules are intended to provide a detailed, yet playable, re-enactment of ancient naval warfare based on the latest data.

They are primarily intended for 1/1200 scale ship models, from small engagements to large ship actions.

The time period covered by the rules represents a singularly large sweep of history from approximately 3000 BC to 600 AD. In terms of ship types, the rules cater for the earliest paddled ships of the Mediterranean through to the small galleys of the Later Roman Empire. It is the period of the development, supremacy, and decline of the ram equipped galley.

NAUMACHIAE  comes from the Greek word (ancient and present)  which is the battle at sea,  = navy and  = battle
NAUMACHIAE (pl.) is the Latin name used by the Romans for the 'sea battles' that various emperors staged at their games. The arena would be flooded and several galleys brought in to fight each other - for the amusement of the crowd.

It focuses firmly on the grand-tactical level of generalship, and includes full scenarios for 48 Greek and Roman land battles (from Marathon to Philippi), based on extensive study of both Ancient and Modern sources.  The 2nd edition (2006) only includes 36 battles, as the designer felt there was insufficient information on the others to create a truly representative scenario.

Strategos makes use of a gridded battle area which makes it well-suited to being played as a boardgame, but it can be also be played on a normal, ungridded tabletop with any number, or scale, of miniature models figures, using any basing arrangement. A comprehensive 5-page example of play (a refight of Cannae) in the 28 page manual (of which 8 pages are the scenarios, and 12 pages are rules) makes it easy to grasp the principles of the game.

For example, if the comp generated the number 436, and your first guess was 423, the comp's number column would light the 2 (meaning you have 2 numbers correct), and would light the 1 in the sequence column (telling you you have 1 number in the correct sequence). Players get one guess and must then pass the unit to the next player. The first player to enter the correct number wins. The game can generate 3, 4 or 5 digit numbers to increase the difficulty.

The book comes with 120 die-cut and mounted counters, just like those in the games themselves.

There are new scenarios covering two very real possibilities that never occurred: a 1936 war between France and the Soviet Union following the Nazi occupation of the Rhineland, and a 1946 war between East and West. Two smaller scenarios concentrate on the Spanish Civil War and the Japanese invasion of China.

And we have variant rules. One set gives Spain and Turkey their own player, who controls both countries but does not have total freedom of action. And then there's the one players have demanded since the day we released John Prados' Third Reich: jet fighters. New jet fighter counters for Germany, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan. Sporting the lovely graphics you've come to expect of the Me262, Gloster Meteor, Nakajima Kikka and more. A set of variant rules now requires that major powers build their jets once the science becomes available, rather than receiving an instant upgrade, and the technology can be captured.

There are new political markers included, allowing Germany to develop advanced submarines, V1 and V2 missiles, and the atomic bomb. The German player has to pay a stiff economic and military price for such science, however. There are V1 and V2 unit counters, too.

Drawing on the tradition of the original edition, we've also added a set of pre-war options players can add to spice up their games: Italian and Polish re-armament, the German Z-Plan, Japanese tank development, a Republican Spain, hard-fighting Austrians, Soviet naval development and more.

The book's centerpiece is a series of strategy articles, analyzing the positions of every player in both the separate games and the combined scenarios. There are also guides to key concepts like economic warfare.

13785,"A Century of Conflict ""The Great Crusade 1939~1945""",1994,7,2,0,2,8,180,180,,Dice Fighting Miniatures Wargame World War II ,Co-operative PlayDice RollingPaper-and-PencilSecret Unit DeploymentSimultaneous Action Selection,"Designed primarily by John Fernandes (a name familiar to many that have ever played/tested some of the early S.P.I. and ST games), this is a series of Booklets detailing an easily comprehended miniatures Rules Set. He decided to produce a much simpler system for conducting 'minis' Combat in order to accustom folks to the entire idea of using them. There have been numerous attempts at this, but very few succeeded(if any), and his 'entry' is a long way towards fulfilling this accomplishment.

What you get are a very large Ziploc Baggie to store it all within; (3)Booklets(designed for 1/285, 1/300, 15mm, or even 20mm); (11/2)-Full Color Sheets(providing Terrain Markers, a 'Compass',  'Firing Arcs' for Guns  Target aspects); a Combat Results Table with the Sequence of Play on the reverse; a Terrain Effects Chart while on it's reverse are the Range Effects, Mine Attacks, Command Efficiency Tables  a Movement Orders Chart with a Scatter Diagram; a Unit Roster Sheet while on it's reverse side is the Artillery Fire Target Plotting Chart; there is a sheet of Unit VALUES Card while on the reverse of this are markers for Wrecks, and small 'S'  'D' ones; and Players will need to provide at least (1) or more DICE of the '12', '8',  '6'-sided variety, before commencing play. Players are given permission to copy anything pertinent to the gameplay using this 'system', and it is highly suggested for some items.

Of the (3) Booklets included, the 'Minis' one is '28' pages long and details the Rules system; the next one is the Consolidated Weapons Data that is '24' pages, along with some 'Supplement' Sheets; and the last one is the Tables of Organization  Scenario Design which is '60' pages long. The Rules explain what to do during the Sequence of Play which is detailed as follows: 1)-Joint Plot Phase; 2)-Initiative Phase; 3)-Posture Determination Phase; 4)-Joint Indirect Phase; 5)-Joint Direct Fire Phase; 6)-Joint Movement Phase;  7)-Marker Removal Phase. The Consolidated Weapons Data Booklet (and 'Supplement' Sheets) provide detailed information for many Nation's weapons and vehicles that are associated with them. There are even individual 'stats' for BOTH of Spain's Civil War participants(the Nationalists  Republicans!). The Table of Organizations and Scenario Design Booklet gives detailed make-ups of various Nation's Units and even during different periods of the entirety of World War 2! With these at your disposal, you should be up and running your own 'minis' based Wargame in very little time.

13786,Monogamy,2001,6.92857,28,1,2,2,60,60,,Humor Mature / Adult Party Game ,Storytelling,"A game that one probably doesn't admit to owning in public.  Monogamy is a two player game meant for committed couples to get to know each other better.

Some alcohol and your partner and you're ready to start.  You move a playing piece around a board and land on squares which involve kissing, drinking, taking clothes off, or taking a card which asked the partner something about themselves or reveals something about you.  Every time you complete the board once you move up a level and the questions, and the kissing become more intimate.

The game starts slow and warms up very nicely.  Not at all tacky although it gets quite exciting at the end!  It is really good to find an adult game not aimed at large numbers of drunken party-goers but at improving the romance and sex-life of a committed couple.


From the rule book: A Hot Affair will have you loving, laughing and lusting after each other with just a few throws of the die. It all begins with a loving gaze into each other's eyes. The last to blink throws the dice to start the game!

As you progress round the board, the questions become more intimate  the challenges more steamy.

Along the way, you'll experience new, exciting and occasionally hilarious challenges with stimulating, sexy and wild conversations.

The game climaxes with the winner choosing to make real one of fifty breathtaking fantasies!

A Hot Affair brings back the art of fun, laughter and lust through a game so neither of you needs to be the instigator. It really does lead to the feeling that you are having an affair... but with your partner!

The other great thing about the game is it can be played on a number of different levels, depending on how you both feel. If you just feel like a romantic and fun night, you can play with the first two levels; if you are both feeling a little more romantic, just shuffle the fantasy cards and have fun! With over 400 ideas at three progressive levels and 50 scenarios, the game can be enjoyed over and over!

The rabbit player wins if the rabbit piece lands by exact count on the space marked White Rabbit's Home. The object for the fox player is to land by exact count on the rabbit. After the fox lands on the rabbit, the rabbit may attempt to escape by rolling the dice, and if the move shown by this roll would land the rabbit in the 5 center spaces marked Briar Patch, the rabbit escapes to the space rolled (landing on the rabbit's house would also escape and win the game). If the rabbit cannot escape the fox wins the game. To compensate for this escape advantage, the fox player gets an additional move on a roll of doubles.

A 4-player version may also be played with 2 fox and 2 rabbits.

CAMBRAI, 1917: The First Blitzkrieg

In the pre-dawn darkness of 20 November, 1917, 378 British tanks and eleven divisions of infantry mounted the first truly mobile offensive in history, overrunning German positions with a rapidity comparable to the Blitzkriegs of the Second World War.  Only a tenacious German defense-in-depth and an equally devastating counterattack employing the new, then-secret infiltration tactics, prevented the British from making a decisive breakthrough.  Despite this setback, Cambrai was the forerunner of the mobile warfare of the Second World War.

Now, THE FIRST BLITZKRIEG: CAMBRAI, 1917 allows you to recreate this battle, one of the most significant in military history.  Two players, each taking on the role of one of the historical commanders, use the Mapboard, 72 unit counters, and complete rules of play, to either change or recreate the historical results.

Description of Game Components:

Game Consist of a two color map, 72 (3/4) counters and rules of play.  No indication of scale is given in the rules.  Map is 17 hexes from West to East and 16 hexes from North to South.  Cambrai is located in north-east (upper right) corner of map  and the town of Sorel-Le-Grand is located in the south-west (lower left) corner of map.  Game is 17 turns in length.

Rules are printed on both sides of single 18 x 16 sheet of paper.  Rules include 13 Variable Historical Options that can be used singly or in combination to offer a virtually limitless amount of scenarios.  Each option changes a historical factor in the game and include: British Develop Infiltration Tactics, General Harper Fragged, Improved Tanks, Germans Forewarned, French Participation, Cavalryman's Fantasy and Free Setup.

Hex Movement system, IGO-UGO sequence of play (with addition of tank attrition phase for British player.

Combat Results Table is Odds Based and consists of a separate table for each type of attack (Standard, Mobile, Probing or Surprise).  A 3-1 attack on the Standard Attack table results in a 33% (1,2) chance of a Defender Eliminated result, a 33% (3,4) chance of a counterattack result in which the defender has the chose of retreating 1 hex or counterattacking one of the hexes the attack was launched from, and a 33% (5,6) chance of a an Exchange result.

From the Game Notes:

CAMBRAI, 1917 is a see-saw battle.  The British have the advantage for the first three turns, but then it begins to slip away.  The German commander than has the opportunity to stabilize the situation and seize the initiative with his counterattack.  Therefore, the German should not give up if things look bad after the first few turns.  The situation can change drastically every turn until the end of the game.

13801,Napoleon's Last Campaigns,1974,6.875,12,2,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Napoleonic Wargame ,Area Movement,"From the Rules Folder:

In 1814 and 1815, Napoleon took on the might of Europe in what proved to be his final campaigns.  The conclusion of each resulted in an abdication -- once he returned, once he did not.

In 1814, Napoleon had the advantage of interior lines, centralized command, and the motivation of fighting for his home soil.  His opponents had none of these -- but they did have overwhelming strength instead.

In 1815, Napoleon had the advantage of surprise and concentration.  His opponents were rapidly joining together.  A quick, decisive strike on each separated army by Napoleon could have spelled victory for the French, instead of defeat at Waterloo.

In NAPOLEON'S LAST CAMPAIGNS you are faced with the intriguing possibilities for tactical and strategic maneuvers presented by both of these classic campaigns and the fate of victory or defeat lies in your hands and mind.

Description of Game Components:

Two color map, 16 x 14, depicting North-eastern France from Paris on the west edge of the map to Brussels in the North and Mainz in the East.  Movement is area based (no hexes) and counters represent Corp. sized units.  No other indication of scale is mentioned in the rules.  Games lenth is either 24 turns for the 1814 scenario or 25 turns for the 1815 scenario.

In addition to unit designation and nationality, each unit has two numbers on the face of the counter.  The first number (on the left) represents the Combat Power of the unit in the 1814 scenario with the number on the left representing the Combat Power of the unit in the 1815 scenario.

Sequence of play is IGO-UGO.

Units may move one area per turn. Rivers and mountains do not hinder movement.  Forest areas take two turns to enter.    French units (ONLY) with supply points may attempt to Force March and move two areas in a turn.  A failed attempt to Force March means the unit does not move at all.  French infantry Force March on a roll (six-sided die) of 1-4.  French Cavalry Force Marches on a roll of 1-5.  Each unit attempting to Force March roll individually.  The Napoleon unit and the French Guards unit may always Force March (no die roll required) if supply is available.

Combat is a two step affair.  In the first step, each player selects a type of attack or defense and cross reference the combination to find the die-roll modification.  The difference between commander ratings also modify the die roll result.  Then the die is rolled on an odds based Combat Results Table and result number is modified by the die-roll modification number determined in the first step.  Combat losses are taken as a percentage of the of the losing forces combat strength.  Combat results can also result in the retreat (one area) of the attacker or defender.

In the days before technology permitted instantaneous movement across the light-years of space, humanoid beings fought the first inter planetary conflict in the constellation Aquila (The Eagle) with the planetary system of the star Altair.  The origin of the conflict dated back to the beginning of the instrumental exploration of the system in the last decades of the 20th century. A band of five Altair planets was found to be rich in rich in raw materials in short supply among certain planets in nearby stellar systems.  Planets from three such stars began immediate plans for colonization and exploitation.

At the games beginning, the invading planets have each established a base of operations and, recognizing the threat from each other, have launched a fleet of three immense Command Ships to further colonize, defend and conquer the Altair system.

Now, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS II allows you to recreate this classic campaign in the depths of space. Two or three players, each taking the role of Commander-in-Chief of an invading fleet, use the mapboard, 86 counters, and rules of play, to replay future history.

In the first mode, players assume the roles of reporters who are trying to get an exclusive scoop of UFO sightings in the city of Frankfurt, Germany.

Each player is assigned a color and a transmission tower.  Their goal is to transport photographs of extraterrestial visitors at locations in the city to their towers (transmitting the scoop back to their news agencies).  Each player starts with one photo card, and take turns to roll a die, moving their card by the die's result.  They draw new photo cards on a 6.  The reporters can deploy Stop Stones to stop other reporters from moving through.  The first reporter to transmit back three photographs wins the game.

The second mode of the game is called Top Secret, which is played on the other side of the game board.  The game takes place in the news agency and players are racing against time to dig out what the others know.  Each player thinks up a secret word at the start.  On their turn, they roll a die, move their marker by the result, and can ask another player for one letter of their word.  Players get points for guessing another player's secret word (which then has to be thought up anew).  The game ends when one player's marker reaches the end point and the winner is the player who has the highest score.

Each player receives a number card for scoring, and an equal amount of small and large chips. On your turn you roll 2 dice and multiply the numbers on them (1x1=1, 3x5=15, 5x6=30 etc.) If the resulting number appears on the outer circle, you cover it with a large chip and also place a small chip on the same number of your card.

If you throw numbers which when multiplied, equal the Devil's numbers (4, 6, or 12), you must pay a large chip into the center circle. A player cannot place a large chip on the outer circle if it is already covered with a chip. The first player to cover 3 numbers across their playing card wins the game and takes all the chips on the board. The winner begins the next game.

In the first game, each player receives a card with 16 numbers (valued 1-6) printed randomly on it in a 4x4 grid. On a turn, a player rolls a die and places a chip on his card over the number rolled. If more than 1 number rolled is uncovered on his card, the player chooses which one to place a chip on. The first player to place 4 chips in row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, calls out KENO and wins the game.

In the second game, players roll 2 dice and cover both the numbers rolled. When a player covers all the spots on his card, the player calls out KENO and play stops. The Keno caller scores 60 points (the sum of all the numbers on his card). The other players add up all the numbers they have covered, and if the number ends with 0 or 5 (45, 50, 55 etc.), the points are taken by the player who called KENO. If the number does not end with 0 or 5, the points are credited to the player who holds that particular card. The first player to score 500 points wins.

But you are probably not interested.

Two to four island maps are attached together, then populated Risk-style.  From then on units are purchased and combat is made in the same vein as Axis  Allies.  Elements that make this game stand out from other war games include the ability loot territories they own to gather immediate production funds, but at the cost of turning that land into a wasteland which produces no further resources as well as the ability to bribe units not to attack.  More typical elements include generals which improve troops attacks, research and development of new technology, and fortifications like cities, labor camps and the run-of-the-mill fortress.

Game comes with four map sheets, (attachable in multiple ways) two war boards, (folding for hidden deployment of troops in battle) and a pile of cut-out chits, money, and stand up buildings and generals.

13835,Ecotox,2004,0,0,0,2,6,30,30,,Environmental Political ,Roll / Spin and Move,"A professionally produced game put out by Voarisoa Observatoire Environnemental, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and other environmental and government agencies.  It is apparently intended to educate players on environmental issues and the regime of international law governing waste and toxic chemicals.

Each player starts with a pawn and eight chits.  Play is standard roll and move.  Players move along a Candyland-like track via roll of a die.  In addition to moving, when a player rolls an odd number, that player picks up a red card, and when a player rolls an even number, that player picks up a green card.  Red cards are negative (such as environmental poisoning or violation of the law) and require you to lose chits or move backwards.  Green cards are positive (such as donating money or following regulations) and allow you to take chits or move forwards.  The winner is the player who makes it to the final space -- so long as that player has not lost all chits.

This is a straightforward luck-of-the-die game, but is notable for its educational bent and its unusual artwork.  The cover, for example, displays a man with a gas mask sucking a lollipop, as well as a baby drinking petroleum.  It is also likely the only game which includes, as part of its rule sheet, the Ten Gold Rules for the Storage of Dangerous Chemicals.

This is a very simple game, composed of a wrestling ring (printed on the inside of the cover) a few cardboard stand-up wrestlers to cut apart and the rulebook itself.

The game suggests several types of matches to play (1-on-1, 2-on-2, or free for all) but in reality any form of pro-wrestling you can think of could be played out with the game, and fairly quickly.

The action flows like this: at the beginning of the round, wrestlers roll for initiative, then in order each wrestler takes two actions, then the round ends.  Actions range from the mundane (move, stand-up, block, defend) to the slightly more interesting (grab/hold, flying leap, body slam, bouncing ram, cheap shot.) Rules for referees, pinning and foreign objects are also included for completeness.

The real meat of the game is in the campaigning.  Each match may take only 20 minutes to play out, but the game features a complete character creation system, as well as rules for continuing a character through a series of matches, with the usual stat-building, etc.  An interesting addition to this is popularity, which is increased by different things depending on whether your character is good or bad and as one could expect side-switching between matches is always a possibility Characters can be further fleshed out by creating a manager for them as well as a signature move.

Game Contents:


    40 bowling cards (bowling deliveries) 
    60 batting cards (batting shots) 
    60 fielding cards (fielding positions) 
    Re-usable scorecard 
    Erasable pen 
    Coin (for the toss)


It is a game for 2 to 4 players. In the standard 4-player form of the game, the game has two teams - the fielding team and the batting team. On the fielding team one player takes the role of the bowler while the other takes the fielder role. On the batting team the two players each take the role of the batsmen.  The batting team will have ten overs to score runs, unless the bowling team can take ten wickets first. The team with the highest score wins.

How it works: The game contains three decks of cards; batting, bowling, fielding. Each over, the batter, the bowler and fielder receive a new set of possible deliveries(bowling cards), shot options (batting cards) and field positions (field cards).
The bowler will try to restrict runs, bowl the batter or appeal for LBW. The batter will try to smash a six. But no, you'll only be able to get a single off that one.

There are optional rules for a two-player game.

The game is broadly speaking a trick-taking card game where the player controlling the batsman tries to follow suit and play a lower-valued card than the bowler.  Play then moves on to the fielder who tries to follow suit and play a card that's equal in value to the batting card played.

13845,Charlie's Year,2004,7.5,4,4.3333,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Age of Reason Wargame ,Point to Point Movement,"From the Publisher:

As the title indicates, Charlie's Year covers the events of the last real threat to the Georgian regime of Great Britain and to the social, economic, and philosophical gains of the Glorious Revolution. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.

Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.

13846,Cockpit of Europe,2004,7.83333,6,3,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Age of Reason Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"From the Manufacturer:

Cockpit of Europe (CoE) covers the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession in the Flanders theater between 1744 and 1748. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. The French leadership were divided into two schools of thought. The traditionalists believed that the Habsburg dynasty was the primary threat to France's position in Europe, and that the main thrust of the war should be made against their possessions in Italy and Germany. The other school feared the rise of the Maritime Powers (England and Holland) and counseled a hard blow in that direction. CoE looks at the five years that the French spent in the Low Countries attempting to smash the ring of enemies surrounding them.

Even though the French, thanks to the sublime leadership of their German-born Marshal, Maurice de Saxe, conquered Belgium and invaded Holland, defeating every army sent against them, the campaigns resulted in a draw. The subsequent peace merely restored the status quo. The stage was then set for the titanic Seven Years War.

Nevertheless, there is great scope for you as the King's Captain General. The armies involved were the largest yet seen on a European battlefield #8800; the French fielded over 200,000 men, and the Allies tried their best to match them. The region is relatively compact, yet difficult to operate in, with the open country thickly studded with fortresses and cut by rivers. Seaward are tracts of swamp and fenland. On the other flank are the dense woods and rugged hills of the Ardennes.

The French player, with the strategic initiative, must constantly press forward, laying siege to town after town (and leaving many men idle in garrison), as he seeks to lever the Allies away from the French frontiers and ultimately threaten the Allies' own bases of operation. The Allied player must decide whether to defend everywhere, to bide his time and harass the enemy, or to launch an offensive of his own. Even if he makes the right choice, however, he must still get the agreement of all the nations under his command

13847,Highland Quorum,2004,8.33333,6,3,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Age of Reason Expansion for Base-game Wargame ,Point to Point Movement,"From the Manufacturer:

THQ is a study of a less known Jacobite Rebellion, the '15. In 1714, Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart monarchs, passed away. Her successor by law was the German George Augustus Welf, Elector of Hanover, who became King George I. But the new regime was far from stable. Only the Whig Party - the forerunners of the Liberals - supported him. He consigned the Tories (the later Conservative Party) to the political wilderness for their part in making peace with France separately from the German states in 1713. The overt supporters of his rival, James Edward Stuart - the Jacobites - were forced to flee or go into hiding.

George took the blame for most of the country's ills following the late War of the Spanish Succession. He relied too much on his Whig friends, which on the one hand gave Parliament more power over royal affairs than ever before, and on the other, encouraged many who would not otherwise have done so to support the Jacobite Cause of restoring the Stuart dynasty. One such man was John Erskine, Earl of Mar, late Secretary of State for Scotland, but now unemployed. Mar belonged to no party (if you except the Earl of Mar's Retirement Assurance Association, which was more of a special interest group) but he was identified with the old Tory regime and had ties to the Scottish Jacobites. He offered his services to George, only to be publicly snubbed. Frustrated, he traveled to Scotland, and began to fan the flames of rebellion.

Scotland had suffered a political union with England in 1707, for which Mar was largely responsible. A persuasive man, he now began to organize a coalition of those opposed to the Union and those opposed to King George. The Loyalists, led by the Whig Duke of Argyle (who had ironically opposed the Union) were alarmed, but the Government took no notice, its members still scrambling for places under the new Administration. With the heather aflame, on the 6th of September 1715, the Royal Standard of the Stuarts went up on the Braes of Mar, before a crowd of 600 that would shortly swell to over 12,000. But, as the Standard went up, the gilt ball on the top of the flagpole fell off

When there he decided that Rome needed a military zone in northern Britain in order to keep the Brigante Tribes under their rule in check and be ready to put down rebellions. Additionally, it was well reasoned that the conceived of wall would also protect Rome from barbarian invasions from the independent tribes of the Scottish highlands. Construction began right away.

In the decades that followed Rome would send a number of expeditions north of the wall in an attempt to subjugate the remainder of the island. The Caledonian tribes of northern Scotland proved challenging to conquer and the hills and mountains of Scotland proved a challenging terrain for the Roman Legions to campaign in.

In this game 2-4 players will compete for dominance of Scotland. One of these players will always be the Romans. The other players will assume control of one or more of the major Caledonian tribes. Rome must conquer all of Scotland to win. The Caledonian tribes must work together, in part, to confront the mighty power of Rome, but should Rome be defeated, only one tribe can emmerge as the victor and warfare with the other tribes is a long tradition easily predating Rome's arrival in Britannia.

A 'disclaimer' is denoted, wherein the publishers attempted to gain permission from FASA to associate the Booklet with *B-T*, but they(FASA) declined to 'Team up' with them on this. Apparently, they(the publisher of this, et al) wished to gain some 'authenticity' from FASA, to allow others to be able to use these 'Rules' in any 'Official' capacity. They've even included a copy of the 'letter' from FASA, with their 'polite' response of no thanks from the then President-Sam Lewis!

Within this Booklet(which measures 5-1/2 inches by 8-1/2 inches), you will find it ALL to be in BLACK  WHITE print(including numerous Artist's drawings) with a BLUE plastic 'binding' for the pages. They have created their very own 'unique' terms for most of these *NEW* concepts, that were arrived at through numerous playings within the *B-T* gaming circles. Some of the items discussed relate to current Vehicles and Weaponry(circa 1992), while others are quite fanciful in their conceptualizations. There are even a few that look to be 'lifted' from some other 'genres', and they've made an attempt to find a 'niche' for them within this. They have even provided Unit Organizational Displays that allow for several individual 'Units' to comprise a much larger one. For some of the 'Weaponry', you'll need to provide a 'Status Sheet' of your own making, but they do provide a general 'diagram' of how to go about accomplishing this. One other item of note- there are numerous 'narratives' that are used to give some sort of more descriptive idea of what is being portrayed. And lastly, there is a means of using another 'product' from this publisher(namely Assault on Kuwait City) with these 'Rules', which is mostly just using the game's counters  mapsheet from that.

13862,Picturesque Places in the Northland,1980,0,0,0,2,4,60,60,,Economic ,Roll / Spin and MoveSet Collection,"Ostensibly a Monopoly-style roll-and-move game, this apparently sparsely-produced game centered around Flagstaff, AZ, has players gaining property in a more abstract method.  The board is laid out in the traditional square with properties lined up on each side and neutral spaces in the corners.  Properties are colored in one of four colors which correspond to the se-va or money notes.  Instead of purchasing properties landed upon, players instead arbitrarily pick up a note of that property's color when they land there, until one player has ten notes of that color and becomes owner of that color so long as they have more than ten notes of that color; when players subsequently land on that color they must pay the player that controls that color three notes of that color.  If unable to pay three notes of that color, they must pay the banker or Escrow Agent five notes of any color.  If a player does not have enough notes to pay the Escrow Agent, they are eliminated from the game.  Though not spelled out entirely, the winner of the game is apparently the last player remaining.  Additionally there are spaces on the board that correspond to the Rattlesnake Pit and Kachina decks, with the former as detrimental se-va losing cards and the latter as beneficial se-va gaining cards.

As an editorial aside, some people refer to games as Multi-Player Solitaire; this game truly qualifies as such.  The _only_ decisions that players can make that affect the outcome of the game are what colors of se-va notes to pay the Escrow Agent when they do not have enough of a single color to pay a property owner, and what color or colors to pay when they draw a Rattlesnake Pit card.  Every other decision is governed by the state of the game and cannot be impacted by the players.

Operation Kremlin uses the corps-army level units that were historically available for this campaign. The German player is on the offensive, seeking to win by controlling Moscow and other key cities. The Soviet player, though mostly defending, must watch for opportunities to deliver counterattacks against the Germans in order to inflict a decisive defeat upon them or upset the Axis alliance. 
 Operation Kremlin's orders of battle are extrapolated from both sides' historic organizational charts of mid to late 1942. The Germans have the units which composed Army Group Center on 28 June 1942, along with all the panzer corps that were deployed elsewhere on the Russian Front. Manstein's 11th Army enters as reinforcement once Sevastopol falls. The Germans also have the Axis satellite armies, on the assumption that their own governments would have wanted to be able to claim participation in this final and decisive campaign in Russia.

The Soviet order of battle is based on their front line deployment of 28 June, along with all their operational and strategic reserves, plus just about everything they generated in the way of replacements and reinforcements during the time period of the historic Stalingrad campaign.

Each hex represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to side. Airpower is represented abstractly, representing the effects of one side or the other having local air superiority. Each full game turn represents one week.

Operation Kremlin gives wargamers the opportunity to discover what would have happened had the Germans struck for Moscow in 1942. Was this the last great chance for the Third Reich to win in the East? Or would it have led to an even greater Stalingrad?

A player chooses which character they wish to play with (depending on how much money they have and their ability to throw that number) and then place their stake on the board, then the game commences with the Gangster and then clockwise to the Lawyer.

Players follow the dice instructions according to the number thrown. Adding more cash to the board if taxed, paying the other pros and cons for their services and trying not to roll OUT. The cash piles up until someone throws their winning number or all the players roll out and there is only one player leftThe Winner.

It is a race game in which the goal is to collect point markers along the way.

The movement of the pawns depends on the card played. Each player has four cards in hand and on his turn he plays one card and advances the pawn to the next space with the card's picture.

Depending on the situation and on the card used, the player can advance faster or slower. As the markers towards the end of the way worth more points, the player would like to advance fast. But in doing so, he can waste the opportunity to earn some important points along the way.

A couple of months ago, a mini edition of Flusskoenig (River King) was released. The new release of Flusskoenig Director's Cut expands the game with several new components that were originally planned for the first game but ended up being cut so that the game duration didn't run too long.

Still, as is usual with NMG games, Flusskoenig Director's Cut will run at least 3 hours (for comparison, Flusskoenig clocked in at 90-120 minutes). Once again, the idea of the game is to transport wares via ship. The players lay out a river network at the start of the game, one that can twist and turn as desired and provide either 'realistic surroundings' or a 'fantasy world'. Players then get money and can buy expensive ships, ship enhancements and branch offices - the things that bring the points necessary for victory. Locks, toll booths, fog and low water make sure that the riverboat captains have to work hard.

The Director's Cut version expands the game with new river tiles with additional hazards, new ship types and wares, a deck of truly evil action and event cards, and other accessories.

Each player's set consists of 52 counters of the same color, numbering from 1 to 13 inclusive, 4 of each number. One player (the leader) turns their counters face down and mixes them up. All other players keep theirs face up and orderly, so they can find the numbers quickly and easily and see what numbers are left. The leader draws a counter and announces the number. All players take a counter of the same number from their set. They may play it to one of 4 columns or one of 4 stacks (foundations). Stacks are started with a 1 and go up sequentially to 13. If a number cannot be placed on a stack, it must be placed at the bottom end of one of the 4 columns. It is most desirable to place counters on columns so that the columns are in descending order. The only way to move a counter from a column is to move it onto one of the stacks. Only the counter at the bottom end of a column may be moved. Continue drawing until all counters have been placed. Your score is the sum of the numbers on the top of your stacks. Each player in turn takes the role of leader and reads off the numbers. Highest score after an agreed-upon number of rounds wins.

Dark Age Games is a new gaming company that has produced a miniatures game based on the art and themes of Brom's Dark Age world. It's a dark and ruined world where different factions and different races battle to survive.

The game is a skirmish level game using a d20 for all dice rolls. It is designed for a two-player game of approximately 20 models aside to take an hour or less for experienced players to play. At the same time it gives you all the tactics and control of alternate activation with detailed control of each model's actions.

Summary of Game Mechanics and Product Design

Game Mechanics 
All dice rolls are with a d20, low rolls are better, special rules for rolling 1's and 20's (criticals).

The measurements are in cm for greater detail and variety amongst units.

Play alternates between players with each activating a single unit at a time (individual or squad) and once all units have gone the turn is over.

This is designed for an average 750 pt game to require approx. 20 figures a side.

Each army plays different, each has a distinct appearance and background.

The majority of units are melee units with advantages stacked in favor of more aggressive play.

Additional rules cover malfunctions, spellcraft, special abilities, formations and many other advanced gaming features.

Dark Age is introduced in the book Genesis, which covers the forces of the Forsaken, led by St. Mark, and opens the setting of this world with their encounters against the non-human Dragyri.

The Story continues in Exodus, with the Forces of St. Mary battling the Skarrd, and Evolution, where the Devotees of St. John encounter the Brood.

The revised Core Rules and several scenarios are presented by themselves in Essence.

The current version of the Dark Age miniatures rules is Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules with expanded current force lists in Dark Age: Apocalypse – Forcelists

Re-implemented by:

    Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules

13937,The Twits Card Game,2002,5.20455,22,1.25,2,5,30,30,,Card Game Children's Game Humor Novel-based ,Hand Management,"Based on characters created by Roald Dahl, this game is billed as... The sneakiest, nastiest, dirtiest game in the world!

It is a simple card game, played over several rounds, in which players manage the cards in their hands in order to score as many points as possible each round.

Some of the cards have positive values and some of the cards have negative values.  There are also special cards marked 'upside down' that change the polarity of the cards in a players hand.

On his or her turn a player takes the top card from the draw deck, banks one set of cards if possible, and then passes one card to the left.  'Upside down' cards may not be passed to another player.

A set of three identical cards may be 'banked' during a players turn.  When one player has banked three sets of cards the round ends and the players score their hands.

All banked cards, whether plus or minus, score plus the face value of the set.  For example three +10 cards score 10 points and three -6 cards score 6 points.  Three 'upside down' cards may be banked for a score of 0.

All the cards in each players' hand are then added together to determine how many points are scored.  An 'Upside down' card in the players hand causes all + cards to become - and all - cards to become +.  If the player has more than one upside down card they cancel each other out.

Once the hands have been scored another round begins.

The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.

First use your knowledge to separate fact from fiction, then steel your nerves and face up to the dilemmas of the bidding. Bid too low and you'll be left behind, so you're tempted to go high - but it could all go horribly wrong. The only consolation is that everyone else is going through exactly the same thing.
 Each round you have to bid according to how many facts you can identify as being correct from a list of ten. If you have the highest bid, you have to identify that many correct facts. If all your chosen facts are genuine, you score a point for each of them. If not, you get no points and the next highest bidder's choices are checked. Once someone has won the points for that round, the players who made lower bids score minus the difference between their bid and the bid of the person who won the points.

Then you try to pick your card up with your teeth. You may have three attempts and only your feet may touch the ground. If you fail, you are out of the game. When everyone has had a turn, the top box is removed from the tower and the remaining players attempt to pick their cards up from that level. If the card has been successfully picked up from the lowest level by more than one player, it is next placed on the floor. If there is still a tie after that, the tower is rebuilt and the remaining players continue as before, but standing on one foot. The winner is the last person left in the game.

Most WWII rules leave you wondering how the Germans ever won a battle.  Usually they fought out-numbered and against opponents with equal or superior equipment.  So how did they ever win? The answer lays in their outstanding unit-level leadership.  Kampfgruppe Commander places leadership quality  at the forefront.  Using the game's unique and fast-paced leader activation system, German units simply fight with more options and capabilities than their opponents.  And each allied army fights differently with its unique command abilities that develop as the war progresses.

Kampfgruppe Commander recreates all aspects of grand tactical mobile warfare using a scale of company-sized, multi-stand units.  Infantry battles are as fast-playing and interesting as tank duels.

The game's mechanics are fast and simple, yet full of historical flavor.  Small to medium sized games can be played in under two hours, or larger battles involving  whole divisions in an evening.

Suitable for all figure scales from micro to 20mm.

However, to confuse you as to the whereabouts of the gold, there are also three other chests containing merely Lead Ingots. Your task is to find the Gold Ingot using the equipment retrieved from the six storerooms.

13954,Highway 2000,1981,5.2,5,1,2,10,30,30,Wargames,Racing Science Fiction Wargame ,Dice RollingModular Board,"A game of automobile conflict in the 21st century

People create their cars and fill out Vehicle Control Sheets, then pick a scenario (all of which take place on a 5-lane highway) and start attacking each other.  Players normally take one car each, or a cycle pack, picked randomly with a die roll on the encounter chart.  (Used for generating random traffic.)

Mechanics are a lot simpler than most games of this type - movement is composed of making lane changes and moving forward based on your speed.  Acceleration/deceleration and movement is plotted secretly, then simultaneously revealed - each turn each car will move one space forwards or sideways for each 10 MPH of speed, broken up into four phases. (Scale is 20 feet per square.)

Only one car (or two motorcycles) is allowed per square - if two cars try to move together they 'bump' and start rolling for critical damage.  Players can roll to make 'emergency' changes to their plotted movement (which is restricted, for example a 'right' move can never be changed into a 'left' move.)

Combat occurs at the end of every phase.  Drivers can fire one turret, (a group of weapons mounted in one of eight directions) gunners can fire two.  Any/all weapons can be fired each phase, which makes for a lot of shooting opportunities, which is good since weapons only fire in a straight line (front/back/right/left/diagonals.)

Scenarios include the basic duel, Rush Hour where there is a chance for random traffic to enter the highway (is what the on-ramp is used for) and a Death Race with 3 to 5 players racing sets of identical cars.

The game comes in a small box, closed with a folding flap like a satchel, complete with 3 highway boards (so you can put the rear board in front and keep driving) counters for the cars, lots of charts  tables, car control sheets and a rule book.

This module provides a rich setting for Grand Prix racing in the year 2012 suitable for use with Battlecars, Car Wars and Highway 2000.  Sample characters, motives and plot ideas are included, allowing for the easy add on of role-playing elements.

Included are a map of the racetrack and surrounding area, maneuvering charts for Car Wars and Battlecars (for the high top speeds) color counters and the game booklet itself.

The book has several pages on general background of 2012 and racing in this environment.  Full details for eight countries worth of racing cars (with stats for each game system) are included. Extra rules include those for traveling at high speeds and details for equipment to use.  Finally there are guidelines for converting between the three game systems.

Playing out an entire race in the scale of these games would be tedious an boring.  Therefore TurboFire provides a framework to play out the race in a general sense  abstracting the race itself so players only need to drop into regular game scale for skirmishes that occur as cars near each other.

The Fette Kuhe (Fat Cows) from Stuttgart-based Spielteufel first graced the gaming table in the 1990's. But they've been dead - excuse me, sold old - for a long time. But now, Fette Kuhe 2 is being released!

It's been nine years since a pair of farmers sat down at their favourite table in the local bar and started arguing about who had the fattest cows in the village - naturally, each claimed that honour for himself. In order to finally have peace in the bar again, the bartender made the following suggestion:

Pick a meadow and then have each farmer send a cow-herder along with 4 similar cows there. After no more than 18 days, the decision would be reached as to which farmer had the fattest cows - that farmer would be rewarded with a feast.

Nowadays, the argument has become a tradition and so the player take on the roles of the cow-herders that lead their cows to eat on the meadow. And also bring them lightning-quick into safety, making sure that they don't get sick in the windy and rainy weather. It's logical that the cows will eat as many grass tiles as they can get, since that's the only way that they'll get really fat.

Four Shooters (catapults) are positioned around the board. Players place 7 marbles in their shooter track, which feeds into their Shooter, before starting. The unit is then turned on by pulling up on the center buoy causing the turntable to spin while the dolphins dance and open their mouths. Players simultaneously try to shoot their marbles into the open mouths. If successful, the marble drains into a side tray by the player's Shooter. If unsuccessful, the marble drains into a random player's shooter track thus giving that player more ammo. When the game ends, the player with the most marbles in his or her side tray is the winner.

13974,Kaji,1935,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,,Card Game ,PartnershipsRock-Paper-ScissorsTrick-taking,"KAJI is based on a Japanese game (JAN-KEN-PO) centuries old, in which the hands are used as symbols. A.k.a. Rock-Paper-Scissors. There are four suits of 12 cards each, numbered 1 -12. The suits are JAN (stone), KEN (scissors), PO (paper) and KAJI (fire). The main version is the 4-player (possible partnership) game, with 2, 3 and 5-player variants.

In the 4-player game, 11 cards are dealt to each player and a 4-card NEKO (kitty) is set aside. There is one round of bidding where each player has one opportunity (in clockwise order) to bid on how many tricks over a book of five she will win. High bidder (Declarer) picks up the kitty, discards 4 cards and then sets trump. Declarer may elect to play the hand alone or chooses a partner by asking for a particular card. Whoever holds that card must show it and becomes the Declarer's partner. The remaining 2 players become partners. Seating order is not changed when the partnerships are formed.

When the KAJI suit is trump, the value of the other suits depends upon the order in which the suits are played and follow the  traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock order (JAN-KEN-PO). However, if not declared trump, KAJI is always the second ranking suit (ex: if JAN is trump, suit rank is JAN-KAJI-KEN-PO). Only a higher trump card will beat another card in the trump suit.

Declarer leads any suit. Play proceeds clockwise in turns, and players must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, she may play any card. If it is a card of lower suit than the previous card, it is regarded as a discard and does not change the current suit. If it is a card of a higher suit, that becomes the current suit. Say Scissors is trump and a Rock card follows a Paper card that is lead. Paper is still the suit to follow or beat. Say Scissors is trump and a Paper card follows a Rock card that is lead. Paper is now the suit ro follow or beat. The winner of each trick leads the next.

When playing in partnership, if the Declarer's partnership achieves or exceeds its bid, each player in the Declarer's partnership scores 5 points for each trick over the book of five that was bid and 10 points per trick over the bid if applicable. If playing alone, Declarer scores 10 points for each trick over the book of five. If Declarer's partnership does not achieve or exceed its bid, each opponent receives 10 points for each trick they fell short. If Declarere is playing alone, opponents receive 20 points for each trick by which the contract failed.

13977,YY classic (YinYang),2003,1,1,0,2,8,50,50,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"A board game for 2 to 8 players. The aim of the game is to form a lifeline using matching symbols. The first player to form a lifeline when he places his last stone is the winner. Chinese sticks (dinner-things) are used to allow fate to determine a lifeline. Anticipation and planning largely determine the chance of success. The element of chance means that everyone ultimately has a chance. The game is derived from Chinese philosophy, which says that all things in life must be in balance. Every object has its opposite, or if you like its complementary element. Black and white, man and woman, water and fire. In short, Yin and Yang. It sounds floating but it isnt. Before the game starts the stones are shuffled and placed on the white triangles on the perimeter with the symbols face down. The numbers in the black triangles remain visible. The color of the pawns is also the color of your starting field. Each player drops the three sticks on each turn. Move the total of the throw (6, 7, 8, or 9) on the main field. The used the philosophy that extremes are changeable. You can make a 6 a 7 and a 9 a 8. There are two rounds. In the first round you collect the stones and in the second round you have to make a line (lifeline) between 2 triangles. Therefore, players may lay a stone on the main field on each turn. Each stone laid down must be able to form a pair. This is an import point. It must be able, nothing more than that. Different pairs may be placed against each other. In this way a lifeline can be formed or stones can be played out. The first player to add his last stone to the lifeline is the winner.
It is a new kind of game. You have to get used to it. But after a few times of playing you will find the pleasure of this strategic game.

Joe action figure Duke against Cobra infantry trooper Neo-Viper in a match to five points. Turning the controller allows the two figures to attack with kicks and punches, with the object to connect with a small strike plate on the opposing character's chest (which releases the catch holding the figure to the controller), knock him out and score a point. Anyone who's ever enjoyed Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots will likely get a kick out of this one, which plays at a much faster pace and allows for a greater variety of attacks.

There are 32 cubes (i.e. dice) used in the game. The dice feature directionals on five sides and the word Cubit on the sixth side. At the start of the game, the cubes are randomly placed on the field, with the four corners left empty. From the instructions: A cube may jump only in the direction (or one of the directions) indicated on its upturned face. However, when the word Cubit appears on the upturned face, that cube may jump in any direction, except diagonally, which is never allowed.

In the two-person game, each player removes as many cubes as possible as long as he can make a jump with the same cube. The player who has jumped the most cubes at the end of the game, when no more moves are possible, is the winner. In the solitaire version, the win occurs when only one cube remains on the board, and it has Cubit on its upturned face.

14019,Castle Quest,1986,3.5,2,0,2,6,0,0,,Economic Fantasy Medieval ,Roll / Spin and Move,"From a review by Rick Heli, Spotlight on Games:

The game comes in a long box with a board, five decks of cards, a number of plastic chips in four colors representing gold pieces, six plastic pawns and a die.

The board is a circular track of thirty-four spaces with a depiction of a castle within it. In the castle are twelve labeled castle sections (drawbridge, six towers, king's court, dungeon, kitchen, rosengarden and dining hall) which players will try to own -- denoted by holding a card with the corresponding name.

Players all begin on the Start space with fifty gold pieces and roll the single die to move forward. Landing on a castle section allows buying that section, or, if it is already owned, forces payment of half the purchase price to the owner. Costs range from six to the most expensive section, the Drawbridge, which costs twenty. No section may be purchased until the Drawbridge has been. Other spaces on the board force drawing a card from one of three available decks which may have a cost to use: Move (free) moves the player to another space; Give (costs two) has various positive and negative effects; Receive (costs two) is similar to Give; Wishing Well (costs ten) has various effects including the Key to the Royal Bedroom. No one can win without the Key card. In addition, it is necessary to own at least half the castle sections.

Other spaces on the board force payment of tax, placed in the center of the board, or the chance to claim all the collected taxes. There are also three Flogging spaces where the player must either pay ten to avoid the flogging and take another turn or else roll a single die and risk going to the Dungeon. Players in the Dungeon languish there until another player is sent to the Dungeon, at which point they pay the new player one gold and resume play. The only other spaces on the board are one each to pick a player to lose a turn and to choose a player to be sent to the Dungeon.

The puzzles are paintings of four different horses, with each in a similar setting, but in a different season.

The puzzle pieces are mixed and distributed facedown, with 40 pieces to each player. Each player sets up a partition to hide his pieces. The horse pictures are mixed facedown and one is dealt to each player. Each player places his picture in the holder slots of his partition; this is the puzzle that player must assemble.

To start the game, players turn over their pieces and begin assembling their puzzles. At any time and throughout the game, any player may offer to trade one to four puzzle pieces. When another player agrees to trade that number, they immediately trade those pieces facedown. At any time, a player may call out Hold Your Horses, and designate right, left, or across. All players must immediately pass one puzzle piece in the direction specified.

Trading continues until one player completes his puzzle. The game may be played by three players by removing one complete puzzle before beginning.

Note: This game was produced by the Springbok puzzle division of the Hallmark Card company. There is no date on either the box or the instruction sheet, so the production year is approximate. Naturally, there is no information regarding who designed the game. It was sold only through Hallmark Card dealers.

Find out what it really feels like to be a politician forced to take positions on issues that please and placate--but don't alienate--the various constituencies and interest groups necessary to reach the critical 270 Electoral Votes needed to win the election.
    You decide which states to focus on, which interest groups to cater to, and which regions of the country to concentrate your efforts in. The game reflects actual current demographics and issues. The Democrat will have difficulty winning traditionally Republican states and vice-versa. Eleven states are key swing states, the same states that were considered battleground states in the 2004 election.
    Larger states tend to stay undecided through most of the game keeping the final outcome in doubt until the very end. Other aspects of the game allow a player who is  behind a constant possibility of being able to catch up. Once you start playing you won't want to stop. Once you finish a game, you'll want to play another.
     It is a great 2 or 4 player game. In the four player game each Presidential candidate has a VP running mate.
As teammates they each focus on winning states in different parts of the nation.

OUPS then decided to travel the world, telling children of his dream and demonstrating the movements. Then he learned that more and more children suffer from attention and learning problems.

Players roll an eight-sided die and move clockwise around the outskirts of France.  Vinyard spaces allow the player the choice of acquiring a wine from the region, or dining on a meal from that region.  City spaces allow dining with a meal from any region.  When Dining, a player rolls the die and references a chart to determine the meal.  He then selects a wine from his holdings, and cross-references another chart to determine the points scored for the meal.  Dessert and Picnic spaces allow discarding wines for a set number of points.  Fortune spaces require the drawing of cards which grant special abilities, change the players location on the board, or cause the loss of a turn.

14047,Sand-Würmchen,2004,5.5,14,1,2,6,20,20,Children's,Action / Dexterity Animals Children's Game ,,"Sandwrmchen (Baby Sand Worms) was invented by Peter Lewe. The children get a box with real sand in it, complete with a plastic cover to keep the sand from running out. There are six spaces in the bottom of the box, into which the colorful baby sand worms are pressed until they are no longer visible. The box is then turned around several times, so that nobody can remember exactly where each color of worm is located any more! Each child then receives cards with baby worms of various colors, after which the game begins.

In turn order, each child tries to find a worm of the colour that matches their topmost card. This they do by carefully digging in the sand. What color appears? If it's the right one, then that child gets to try and reveal a worm that matches their next card. If it's the wrong one, then maybe he'll have better luck next time, once several worms have been discovered. The box is turned around at the end of each round, so players have to pay close attention to where the worms are! At the end of the game, once all cards have been assigned to their worms, each child gets to place a marker where they think a worm of the matching colour is located. Then comes the exciting ending: one child gets to rattle the box until all of the worms have poked their heads out of the sand. Who was able to guess right?

If he/she gets the right answer then they win the card, if not then the next player on the left (and so on) can attempt to get the right answer until someone wins the cards.  Play continues for a previously agreed number of cards, with the question-master role being rotated, and the winner is the one who has won the most cards at the end.  Many of the answers can be quite obscure, such as: blade of grass, a monocle, a cindy doll...so it can be quite hard to gain the card within the first sixty seconds

Every voting card has  some characteristics of the politicians; some are clear, some you have to discuss in order to show how the characteristic applies to your candidate so that you can get voting points .

The best five get to be  communal ministers and earn money.

In the second round,  three national parliamentarians will be elected and in the last round  one will be elected  Swiss Minister.

Very funny, with very *interesting politicians and voting cards.

14096,Striker II,1994,6.25,18,2.2,2,2,1,1,Wargames,Miniatures Science Fiction Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"From the back cover:

Striker II is the miniatures combat rules of 58th century warfare, for use with Traveler:The New Era. Now the epic planetary engagements of the New Era, The Final War, or the Frontier Wars are under your control, allowing you to command battalions of lift infantry, drop troops, and grav armor. These rules are fully compatible with Traveler, and so also allow miniatures resolution of role-playing adventures.

Combat in the 58th century is fast-moving, and so is Striker II. Based on the award-winning Command Decision miniature rules, Striker II allows rapid play which replicates the rapid tempo and quick reactions of advanced technology warfare. These straight-forward rules allow players to concentrate on the mental dilemmas of tactics and command, not the interpretation of complicated rules mechanics.

Striker II is more than just rules, it is also an extensive source of military hardware and organizations-from the jeeps and tracked vehicles of Wilds units to the speeders and gray tanks of a Reformation Coalition Marine Brigade. Striker II also includes tables of organization and equipment listings for some of the most important military units from Traveller's long history: Zhondai Lift Infantry Battalions and Commando Groupments, Imperial Marine Task Forces, Imperial Guard Regiments, and the legendary 4518th Lift Infantry Regiment- The Duke of Regina's Own Huscarls.

Striker II provides the full science fiction combat experience with rules on orbital bombardment, drop troops, anti-missle fire control, planetary environment, and orbital superiority. Campaign rules allow a sophisticated strategic gaming experience by adding the effects of combat engineers, maintenance, and quality of food and medical care.

14097,Gå På,2002,7.35,10,4.25,2,6,0,0,Wargames,Age of Reason Miniatures Wargame ,Action Point Allowance System,"Miniature wargame rules for The War of the Spanish Succession 1701-1714 and The Great Northern War 1700-1721. The players take command of the armies of Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Louis XIV, Charles XII of Sweden, Tsar Peter the Great etc. 
The game is focused on command and control (or the lack of it in this period). The commander in chief and the wing commanders of the armies have a fixed number of opportunities per turn to try to give orders to units, depending on their abilities. Units without orders act with a kind of artificial intelligence depending on unit type and troop quality. For example, heavy cavalry with good morale will generally charge nearest enemy unit within sight. The presence of retreating or fleeing friendly units increase the chances that a given unit also will retreat/flee etc. Battlefield visibility decrease as the battle proceeds, so commanders and units will have an increasingly harder time to see each other.
Optional figure scales and basing. Each battle have two sides, but several players can easily take the role of a wing commander each.

The rules provide army lists and optional rules that may be used to provide greater detail and a more tactical feel, as desired by the players. A separate, 98-page book on Armies of the War of the Spanish Succession and the Great Northern Wars has been published by the designers giving greatly detailed army lists along with additional new and optional rules.

From 1618 to 1648 most of Western Europe was engulfed in a brutal dynastic struggle. The game is an operational/strategic Level simulation with each turn representing one year and military units representing armies of various types and strengths. This is basically a (2) player game with (1) player having the Habsburg forces, while the other player has the Anti-Habsburg(or 'Coalition') forces. There are (3) Scenarios presented, beginning the Game at either '1618', '1630', or even '1636'. Players will need to provide their OWN '6'-sided DIE, before commencing play. This game is described as: A medium complexity strategic game of this period of turmoil. The TROOP 'strengths' can be considered as 'hidden' since the FRONT of the 'counter' depicts ONLY that it is a TROOP, while on the REVERSE of them is the actual 'strength' denomination. The scale is given as '48'-kilometres across EACH 'Hex' and Yearly Game Turns. This Game was produced in either a Plastic Baggie form, or as a Boxed edition, for those that might find one of these versions.

The gamemap(of '3'-colors~BLUE, TAN, GRAY or a combination of those) depicts an area encompassing Eastern France  the 'Benelux' countries, over to mid-Poland/Hungary, and from Northern Italy up to the Baltic Coast. As is usual with the excellent production values of the fine folks at Simulations Canada, this gamemap has plenty of useful information contained upon the 'Gamemap', such as: a 'Terrain Key'; a 'Victory Point Track'; (3)~Resources Available Charts(for EACH of the '3' Scenarios); an 'Event Generation' Table; 'Movement  Winter Attrition' Tables; with 'Field and Siege Combat Results' Tables. There are '200' Game counters(printed on FRONT and BACK) in quite a large variety of COLORS, such as: RED; Dark RED; BURGUNDY; BROWN; PINK; YELLOW; GREEN; BLUE; Dark BLUE; Light BLUE; TAN; GRAY and WHITE. These mainly consist of TROOP and LEADER counters, with small silhouettes for them, while there are other 'Informational'(with appropriate 'silhouettes') ones as well, such as: 'CONTROL'; 'Siege'; 'Plague'; 'Famine'; 'Barren'; 'Sacked';  'Rebuild'; 'Game Turn'; numbered counters from '1~6'; and (2) sets of 'Victory Point Track' markers('1' SET for EACH player).

The Sequence of Play is as follows:
A.-Payment and Recruitment Phase:
1.-Pay Units on Map. 2.-Recruit new Units. 3.-Place new Leaders. 4.-Wounded Leaders recover.
B.-Flip 'Sacked' Markers and Remove 'Rebuilding' Markers.
C.-Event Phase: 1.Roll Yearly 'Event' and any Scenario *Special* 'Event'.
D.-Initiative Phase
E.-Movement and Combat Phase: [1st Player]

F.-Movement and Combat Phase: [2nd Player]~same as 1st Player.
G.-Siege Maintenance Phase
H.-Removal of 'Barren' counters placed previous year.

The goal of the game is it to fulfill as the first three different from five different victory conditions : be the first on level 3 OR 1 win one fight OR deliver 4 equal Nuggets OR deliver 3 Nuggets in 2 colors OR deliver 1 Nugget in 5 different colors . If one wants to fulfill a victory condition, which already a fellow player fulfilled, one must exceed this, therefore, for example be the first on  level 4 or win 2 fights.

Whos turn it is, can always do 2 actions:
1) move a figure one space, or bring it back into the game or move and fight or exchange partners. 
2) Implement an action with the man or the woman.

The Action of the man exists in collecting Nuggets. He draws a Nugget from the Nugget bag and compares the color with the wood tiles around himself. According to the same color it may indicate then Nuggets on its play board. Subsequently, he puts the harvested fields into the wood bag. Sometimes it could happen that you sink your own figures.
The action of the woman exists in the structure of the country. To do this 2 wood panels are drawn from the wood bag and lied down adjacent to the tile of the woman. So you can build higher levels
So remember: The man collects the Nuggets and destroys the land, the woman develops the land!

If you like abstracts especially TRIAS or TORRES this one is worth a try.

All but 4 cards are dealt to the players; the top card of the remaining 4 is turned up to determine trumps. This is a trick-taking game. One player leads to the first trick and may play any card in his hand. Succeeding players must follow these rules (in order) when playing: (1) Must play a card of the same suit that was led; (2) If player does not have the suit led, she must play a trump card; (3) If player cannot do either rule (1) or (2), he may play any suit. In addition, once it is determined which of the three foregoing rules applies to a player, she, if possible, must play a card that has a higher numeric value than the highest-valued card already played to the trick. If she cannot play a higher card, then she may play any card that follows the applicable rule. When all players have one card left in their hands, the round ends. Each players score is the number of tricks he caught times the numerical value of the Last Card remaining in his hand (thus the title of the game).

These Gangsters used hits to protect their interests, and it is said that the best contract hitters worked for Termination Incorporated.
To satisfy the people's need for combat, the controlling Council devised a tournament to be held in vast stadiums in front of thousands of ecstatic, yelling fans.
Here combatants use stealth, courage and tactical awareness to out manoeuvre and attack their opponents, scoring points with their Electric Pulse Discharge Guns, then making their escape using the hard laser walls as cover.
Many tried and failed, but eventually the very best of the very best were able to compete for the trophy called Termination Incorporated.

Use movement cards to travel across a maze-like board and shoot your opponents before they shoot you.  Dice are used to determine damage depending upon your distance away (with a couple of auto-result cards that can be used.)  You have limited ammo and need to reload at specific squares. There's a minor card bluffing element (you can shield yourself for a turn but you might be bluffing.)  There is a single sheet ruleset which explains what all the bits do but leaves you to infer how the game itself works.
The production values are reasonably high, but all the cards and the board are in monochrome.
Basically, it's like Frag but without the interesting weapons or objects or slight role-playing element.

They take it in turns to add a nose to the pattern according to the rules, and when a player makes or increases a group of one type of nose, they place one of their five colored markers on it. (If you happen to increase two groups, you place 2 markers.)

But as soon as another player increases that group, their marker replaces the first, which goes back to the other player. In this way, the pattern gets bigger and players fight to control the noses. But because of the random distribution, you will have some fewer noses than others, so the placement becomes very tactical as you try to close off groups and secure your scoring.

The pattern must sit within a 10x10 grid, and all the tiles are open, so it pays to deliberately extend the grid in one direction, giving or taking away opportunities. When no more tiles can be placed, you score one point for each nose you own.

A surprisingly tricky game given the range of noses, Nasenspiel entertains with a delightful combination of sacrifice and reward and a very unusual theme.

14157,The Curious Affair at Dredmoor,2003,5,1,0,6,12,180,180,,Murder/Mystery Party Game Real-time ,Role PlayingTrading,"On the surface, this is a murder mystery party game that advertises to never play the same game twice.  This is accomplished by making it more of a card game that is played out in different rooms of the house in live scale fashion.

Players are given a character, which is only for theme.  However, each character is attempting to collect sets of a specific type of card (Ambition, Passion, or Greed).

Each player starts the evening with 4 cards.  Most of these cards will be either Ambition, Passion, or Greed cards; however, there are four weapon cards also distributed.   Throughout the house will be four vaults, each of which has a face-down card.

The player's goals are to:
- collect 4 cards of their desired type
- determine who burgled from the vaults
- determine who murdered other players

The first step in the game is that players stand in a circle and show two of their cards to the player on the right and the other two of their cards to the player on their left.

When the game begins, players can do several things to improve their hand:
- They can trade cards with another player.
- They can trade cards with a vault.  However, the first player to do so is considered to be burgling the vault.  Future trades with the vault are not considered burgling.
- They can commit murder.  They need a weapon card and they need to get another player alone.  They whisper Bloody Murder, and place the weapon card in the victim's name badge.  The murderer may then look through the victim's cards and take one.  The victim lies dead until someone finds the body.  The person who finds the body may trade one card from the victim's hand, then the victim is alive to continue the game (with a hand of three cards and an exposed, used murder weapon).

After one hour, the players are brought together to discuss the evening.  Each of the burglaries and murders are discussed.  Murder victims lose points if the murderer is discusovered, so it benefits them to keep quiet or lie about the murder.  Players then records their accusations for the four murders and four burglaries.

Points are totaled as follows:
 - Each correct accusation: 10 points for the player, -10 points for the Murderer/Victim/Burglars involved.
 - Each clue card that matches the motive of the player: 50 points.

All the combatants are modeled after Saturday morning cartoon characters, and that the damage caused by the weapons isn't really real! Each bit of damage puts a hole in the character (just like a cartoon!), and when they've taken enough holes, they are out of the game. But they come back for the next episode, safe and sound!

This game is intended to be a fast and fun introduction to the world of miniatures games. Each soldier has an INDEX that tells you how fast it is, how smart it is, how well it can shoot, and more. They also have a list of whatever weapons they carry. Using this, you as the player control how the battle unfolds, and try for ultimate victory.

The combat is quick-paced and east to learn. It uses a single roll on a ten-sided die to figure out any combat. The emphasis is on fun and excitement, not massive tomes of over complicated, supposedly realistic systems that bog down in too much detail.



In 1992 a supplement with roleplaying rules was released, see the RPGGeek entry Critter Commandos Compendium.

The Standard Game is provided for a quick way of resolving large scale combats between two opposing forces in a minimum amount of time. The Standard Game doesn't require a Gamemaster or Referee; instead, the rules provide a set of guidelines that make a GM unnecessary for resolving movement and combat. The Standard Game is an abstracted method for simulating large scale battles without a GM. In that sense, it is more like a military simulation board game than a role playing game.

War Law covers morale rules, maneuver rules, ferocity rules, leaders, formations, siege weapons, and historical and tactical considerations. The scale is 50-100 combatants per unit. Each unit has an Offensive Bonus, a Defensive Bonus, an Armor Type, a level, and a shield bonus. In addition, units also have a movement point total and a morale rating. Combat is resolved using percentile dice and an extensive collections of charts. Counters and hexmaps (5/8 hex = 100ft.) are provided, but miniatures can also be used.

It is for those who wish to employ for themselves the techniques of Surrealist inquiry and discovery; it sets out the rules and directions for playing the games. There has been nothing like it: much of the material gathered here has been previously documented only in obscure journals, or in magazines long since defunct and difficult to come by.

The Surrealists initiated the most radically liberating critique of reason of the century. Their brilliant investigations were conducted through art and polemic, manifesto and demonstration, love and politics. But most specially and remarkably, it was through games, play, techniques of surprise and methodologies of the fantastic that they subverted academic modes of inquiry, and undermined the complacent certainties of the reasonable and respectable. Playful procedures and systematic stratagems provided keys to unlock the door to the unconscious and to release the visual and verbal poetry of collective creativity.

A small format book details numerous games that involve automatism, simulation, role playing, story creation, randomness, and dadaist poetics. The hardcover version also includes a full-color, fold-out gameboard for a game called The Goose Game with nonsensical rules, designed and produced by noted surrealist Andre Breton. A surrealist dictionary and a removable tattoo are also included with the hardcover edition.

Included are 200 photos of celebrities: movie stars, musicians, sports heroes, and political and military figures.  Each card has multiple questions on the back about the pictured person.

The object of the game is to identify the person in the picture and then answer questions about that person. The questions asked are determined by a roll of two 6-sided dice. Rewards and penalties are also determined by the number on the dice roll. For example, if the player roles a 7, they answer Question 7 on the card, and receive 10 points if correct PLUS any bonuses indicated next to Question 7. Every time a player fails to answer a question, the opportunity to do so moves to the next player and the value for the correct answer goes up 5 points.

The Quizmaster role is first determined by a roll of the dice. This person queries each player in turn, and notes their score on the scorecard. Once all players have been quizzed, the Quizzmaster role then rotates clockwise.

The accompanying 94-page booklet contains additional biographical information about each celebrity.

14190,"Computer Sports Games: Football, Baseball, Basketball, Hockey, Soccer",1972,3,1,0,2,2,60,60,,Sports ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"In the late sixties, Electronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their Computer Games line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.

This game combined five of the earlier sports titles into one game. The football field was printed on the wooden board, and two double-sided cardboard overlays contain the playing fields for the other games.

This was followed by the 1974 release of this smaller format five-in-one system. Instead of using the oversized wooden boards characteristic of the original EDC games, this edition uses a smaller plastic board which only displays the game matrix. Two double-sided cardboard overlays contain the matrices for the other sports. The individual playing fields are printed on cardstock panels. Plastic markers are used to record the position of the ball/puck and show other game stats.

The other pieces are randomly placed face-down on the remaining spaces. Each player gets a pawn and places it on top of a face-down token.

A turn consists of moving towards a face-down token and turning the token in the space you just left face-up. You cannot move towards face-up tokens or empty spaces. You can move over the bridge token.

If the revealed illustration does not match another one on the board, play passes towards the next player.
If the illustration on the token you just turned face-up matches another face-up illustration on the board you remove both pieces and turn the other face-up tokens face down. You may then place the bridge token to a free location of your choice and turn another token of your choice face up and resume play.

The game ends when no player can make a legal move. The winner is the player who has the most matching pairs.

The game is for sale in Belgium, all proceedings go towards a go cause.

14229,D-DAY: Rudder's Line,2004,6.19118,17,2,1,2,0,0,,,,"Rudders Line is an AREA MOVEMENT game that simulates The Battle of Normandy, specifically the landing of the 2nd Ranger Battalion at Point du Hoc on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Players take the sides of the German 726th Infantry Regiment or elite US Army Rangers of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. Following an unprecedented invasion by landing and cliff-scaling in the face of enemy fire, the battle devolved into the quintessential hedgerow battle in Normandys bocage. The Rangers were literally backs to the sea, cut off from friendly forces until a relief column reached them from Omaha Beach on 8 June 1944. The German defenders pushed James Rudder and his men to the point of annihilation. It was a near run thing.
The game depicts the hedgerow fighting that followed the D-Day landing of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. It is meant to be a hard-hitting, fast playing board game that recreates the close-in and deadly nature of the battle, fought for each individual field.

Game Scale: The game is scaled at about 100 yards to the inch. Units for both sides are small groups of soldiers approximating squads, non-commissioned officers, FOs, weapons crews, and individual machine-guns, mortars, and shoulder-fired Bazooka and Panzerschreck rocket launchers. Each game turn represents six hours.

Game Board: The game board uses a US Army map of the battlefield, divided into a collection of 35 numbered areas or sectors. Areas come in various shapes and sizes, with a dotted green border separating them. Each area contains two numbers: an identification number in a green box, and a Terrain Effects Modifier number (proceeded by a + sign) in a yellow circle.

What You Get:
One 11 x 17 hard backed game board;
80 color mounted die cut counters;
One 4-page rulebook;
Players must provide one or more six-sided dice.

The game was first advertised in Votes for Women on the 22 October 1909 and many of the references to recent events are illustrated by the squares. The illustrations on the board show the difficulties encountered by Pankhurst and her supporters in the militant suffragette movement.

Comments from The Jon A. Lindseth Suffrage Collection

The Pank-a-Squith board game was first advertised in Votes for Women on 22 October 1909. It comes with six painted, cast lead, figures for the suffragettes. The board is stamped Made in Germany on the back.

The goal of this board game is to reach the Houses of Parliament, the pinnacle of achievement for the campaign for Womans Suffrage. Although designed to be humorous, the images evoke the darker side of the campaign, making reference to police violence against women protesters and the force-feeding of imprisoned hunger strikers.

14268,George Washington's Campaigns,1976,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,Wargames,American Revolutionary War Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemModular Board,"George Washington's Campaigns is a boxed boardgame featuring scenarios for the battles of Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.  A square, heavy cardboard base with raised frame allows specific battlefields to be composed from a set of 144 one-by-one-inch terrain tiles (using the backs for clear terrain), producing a square-grid map.  Terrain tile types include hill (white slope splashes on brown), wooded (white outlines of trees on green), swamp (green swamp grass humps on white), river (white waves on blue), fort (white squares on brown), city (white streets on brown), objective (star), and combinations of several of these types (such as city streets superimposed on brown-backed hill).

Scenario cards provide a summary of each battle, order of battle for each side, terrain diagram for board set-up, and initial deployment.  Several scenarios have special rules or late-appearing forces.

Combat units are 7/8 square two-sided counters.  Full-strength side is a white silhouette (infantryman, rider, or cannon) on a dark blue (Continental) or bright red (British) background.  Also represented are French (lighter shade of blue) and Hessians (lighter shade of red).  The reverse side of each counter is a national-color silhouette on white, representing a reduced-strength unit.

Units are further differentiated into Regular, Light, and Grenadier Infantry, Artillery, or mounted Dragoons.  The counter mix includes includes eight Continental infantry units (all rated as Light), two Continental Dragoons and two Continental Artillery, plus two French Regulars, one French Light, one French Grenadier, one French Dragoon and one French Artillery.

On the side of the Crown are six British Regular, one British Light, one British Grenadier, two British Dragoon and two British Artillery units, plus two Hessian Regular, one Hessian Light, one Hessian Grenadier, one Hessian Dragoon and one Hessian Artillery.

Most battles feature from seven to ten units on a side.  From battle to battle, unit scale, obviously abstracted, varies from one regiment to a division each.  The overall composition of each army in a scenario, however, strives to represent the historic proportions present at that action.

Unit scale, combined with the grid scale of each battlefield, allows great variety in approach and many options for force allocation and maneuver.

Movement is Igo-Ugo with a twist.  Movement is regulated by the draw of one card each turn by each player.  Cards are pre-cut, about three by two inches, glossy red on the back with a red number on the face.  The number on each card (from one to ten) indicates the total number of movement points that may be expended by the owner's side that turn.  There are a total of forty cards, one for each turn in a scenario.  When the cards are all used, the scenario is ended.

Movement points may be divided among the owning player's units in any manner desired.  One unit might move ten spaces through clear terrain, or multiple units may be moved in any desired order, so long as the maximum number of moves for that turn (defined by the card drawn) is not exceeded.  Friendly units may move through one another, but no stacking is permitted at turn's end.

Rules (which only total four pates) are divided into Basic and Advanced.  In the Basic Game, Swamps stop movement and rivers may only be crossed at diagonal bends between river squares (representing fords or bridges).  No diagonal movement is permitted except for such river crossings.

In the Advanced Game, terrain becomes more restrictive; Artillery, for example, may not enter Forest or Swamp squares.  Dragoons and Light Infantry units may move diagonally--a significant advantage.  Dragoons, if chosen for movement,  may also move two squares for each turn movement point allowed on the movement card for that turn.  Advanced Rules also provide for defensive benefits in fort, city or hill terrain, a quality advantage for Grenadiers, new rules for retreats, and Bayonet Attacks--costly but devastating if successful.

Units adjacent to enemy units at turn's end will receive defensive fire (roll one or two on a D6 for a hit).  Units are flipped on the first hit, eliminated on the second.  Attacking units which receive a first hit are retreated one space.  Surviving friendly units will then attack an adjacent enemy unit by the same method.

Victory is determined by points scored.  Two points are scored for each objective square occupied by a friendly unit at game's end, and one point for each enemy unit eliminated.  Given the area represented by each battlefield map, players usually have a choice between driving for geographical objectives and destroying enemy forces.  However, troop resources are finite and a reverse often compels a change in plan.

Although George Washington's Campaigns might more accurately be titled Battles of George Washington, a campaign game rule provides for a victory based on accrued points from multiple battle scenarios.  Since each scenario plays fast--rarely more than an hour--this is a viable approach to the game.

The game is free of ambiguity and errors, provides a fine vehicle for introducing new gamers to the hobby, and provides a fast but entertaining and balanced puzzle for the more experienced.  Almost thirty years later, it is notable for its clean rules, accessibility, and replayability.  Until the recent appearance of Decision Games' American Revolution series, it also provided the only published Long Island scenario in the gaming world.

This game was evidently produced with the U.S. Bicentennial (1976).  The number of copies printed is unknown; this game was found in the early 1980's at a shop in Alexandria, Va.  The box is approximately 16 x 14 by 1 1/2 inches in size, white background with a large blue drawing of Washington and his staff mounted on a hil, with red, white and blue letters in the lower right proclaiming the title.  Included is a cardboard insert providing a tray for pieces and printed examples of play.

Two, four or eight players control respectively four, two or one sail boats. The winner is not always the first one to arrive, but the boat (among the ones arrived in time) that has scored the best points. Points are awarded or lost due to cards, not giving way to other boats when you should, passing the buoys first or on the wrong side and so on. The game uses dice, but it's not a new version of The Duck Game! There is space for luck (wind direction and other things) but also for some tactics and for some cooperation between boats of the same player. For this reason the best way to play it is in two or four people.

In the woods near Athens three to six enamored asses are in search of their partners. Because of Puck, the asses are always in love with one of several possible asses. Yet, only one ass is the right partner.
By meeting other asses frequently, you can climb the fairies' ladder. But those who are unfaithful and visit the wrong asses too often support their opponents. 
Titania, Oberon, Elves, presents and the Wall add tactics to the game.

In the romantic version, the players themselves are the asses. They exchange vows of love, turn each other down and give each other romantic presents.

The children's game is played without the fairies and thus moves ahead much faster.

At the beginning of the game, each player draws three different images onto small sheets of paper. Then s/he puts them into three pouches, hands in the pouches, and all pouches are shuffled. A moderator for the round draws a task now, i.e. something that has to be advertised. S/he randomly picks three pouches then, reveals the pictures and everyone discusses which picture is most suitable for the task. After a time of such discussion, each player secretly votes 2 - 1 - 0 points on the three designs. Votes are simultaneously revealed. Players get bonus points for agreeing on something. Also, a player may make a guess as to who drew a certain picture. If noone is able to guess, the artist gets extra points, if there are correct guesses, these are rewarded.

When all images have been awarded points, a second round starts, in which the same pictures are used again, but for different tasks and in different combinations. At the end of that second round, the final scoring happens: One after one, the players reveal what images were theirs and receive points. The highest overall score wins.

Each turn a letter is selected by pulling one of the cards at random and looking at the reverse side. Then you select a suite and find enough cards from that suite (all alike) so that each player gets one.

On each card there are 10 categories. The players' task is to find one word that starts with the selected letter for each category.

The publishing year of 1950 is a guess, mostly from the general appearance of the game and the fact that is has categories like Star in the 1948 Olympics.

14309,Chamelequin,1989,5.96296,27,1,2,4,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Pattern Building,"From Dave Farquhar's Review:

Chamelequin is described on the box as 'a game of skill and ever changing colours'; a reasonably accurate summary. The board is a striking 8x8 grid of large coloured squares. These alternate, with one row being green and yellow, the next red and blue. The effect of this was illustrated by Alastair (age 1) sobbing his heart out when I wouldn't let him play on it. The plastic pieces comprise circular bases, from which a stem protrudes, and large numbers of coloured 'polo shaped' rings. The object of the game is to be the survivor.

The initial set up is achieved by the players alternately placing one of their pieces on the board, at the same time dropping a coloured ring onto the stem. The basic principle is that the uppermost ring will always be the same colour as the square the piece occupies. This continues until all have been placed; ten each if two player, otherwise eight.

Player turns then continue, with one piece being moved each turn. This may be done in one of two ways: by moving one square and adding a ring or by removing rings and moving up to three squares. The former option is the standard move, and in this way stacks of up to four rings may be built up. Each time the colour ring selected matches the square moved to. The latter option is generally an attacking move. The top ring is removed, and the ring thus revealed shows the colour square which is then moved to. This process may be continued, until only one is left, at which point the move must stop as the last ring may never be removed. Any enemy pieces encountered during this move are eliminated from play. It is theoretically possible to capture three enemy pieces in one turn.

They also published a few games in other formats, one of which was the crackerbox format used for Mr. Who (Bid  Bluff is the only other game published in this box type).
The game, Mr. Who, is a somewhat unusual deduction game. There are 32 Suspect cards which show pictures like those on the outside of the box - the suspect is always the same man (Robert de Niro look-a-like) but could be wearing one of four different hats, sunglasses or not, and one of four differently-colored sweaters. There are also 32 Mr. Who cards which have written descriptions that match the Suspect cards, but with the characteristics in random order. In each round, one player is Mr. Who and picks a Mr. Who card - the other players are detectives and try to deduce which suspect he is. They play cards to the grid on the board to get information on the three items on the Mr. Who card. During this process Mr. Who commits more crimes and the reward money increases. After everyone has been Mr. Who once the player with the most money wins.
The board is made of vinyl. A little metal car is used to track Mr. Who's progress. The reward marker is a generic plastic pawn.

This is the tricky part

The trick is to hide your special keyword so that no-one can guess what it is, but you've also got to incorporate a theme into your story according to which space you land on; Crime, Love Affair, Witness, or Hero.

The thin cardboard board is glued inside the bottom of the small box (box measures 7x10.5x0.75). There are five race horses, named for famous ones (Whirlaway, Citation, Twenty Grand, Seabiscuit, and Gallant Fox). The tiny plastic horses each fit in slots cut out of the 'board' which allows them to slide down the race track. They start at a column labeled Post, then travel through Quarter, Half, Three-Quarter, Mile, and Stretch, to reach the Finish. A built-in spinner has two labeled areas for each horse. Here are the rules printed on the board: All horses are lined up in POST position. Each player selects a horse to race. He spins in turn, then advances the horse indicated on the spinner, whether or not it is his horse, to the next position. When spinner stops on a line, spin does not count. The first horse to reach FINISH is the winner.

There are actually several different versions of this game published in varying decades with horses from that particular time period represented. In addition, some versions have a different number of horses (up to seven) represented. Finally, instead of having horses inserted into tracks, some later versions have horse playing pieces on a similar inlaid board.

All the elements of a real-life game of one day limited over cricket.  Seems complicated.
Lots of different dice, coloured counters etc 
Basic Rules for 2 players
Players will be called Captains. The toss of a coin will determine who will elect to bat or bowl first. You are now in a position to set up the board to commence play as outlined in Diagram 1. The bowling captain selects any one of his five bowlers and places him at either end of the pitch in the position marked bowler. The batting captain selects any two of his eleven batsmen and places one on the pitch as striker and the other as non-striker. The striker is placed on the opposite end of the pitch to the bowler.
CRITICAL ASPECTS OF PLAY TO REMEMBER a)Study the layout of the board prior to commencement of play
b) The bowling captain moves the yellow deliveries counter prior to each delivery. c) The bowling area must be cleared before casting of the dice. d) The batsmen in play must change ends on the scoring of one or three runs. e) It is the bowling captain's responsibility to complete the scoresheet. f) The batting captain is responsible for recording his batsmen's runs on the individual batsman's scoreboard. Extras are recorded by the bowler on the scoresheet. g) The three blue dice i.e. bye, wide and runout, once selected must be cast with the umpire dice. h) Once a batsman is dismissed the batting captain must advise the bowling captain of the runs scored before removing scoring counters from the individual batsmen's scoreboard. i) If a game is shortened to a lesser number of overs than fifty, it is essential that all five bowlers bowl the same number of overs each. DISMISSALS Batsmen can be dismissed in four ways: 1. Bowled 2. Caught 3. L.B.W 4. Run Out

About the HEX-TRI Game:

- This is a strategic, multiplayer board game, based on logic.
- 2 to 6 players may play the game together.
- Anyone can learn the rules, and get familiar with the dynamics of the game within a few minutes of play.
- New tactics are learned best while playing the game.
- Because of the virtually infinity number of possible game situations, it takes a long-long time to become prepared to handle those sneaky tricks in game.

The objective of the game is to take out the Main Figure of the enemy. If a players Main Figure is removed from the board, all of his/her figures are removed from this game.

Gaming concept:
The game play is based on rounds taking place after each other. A round is divided into 3 phases. In the 1st phase of all round, the players makes their movements with the figures, using the points available to them on the fields. After this the game proceeds to the 2nd phase, in which some of the hex-fields produces points available to be used in the next round. In the 3rd phase the battles takes place on fields occupied by more players. As a result of battle the field becomes the territory of the player with more figures standing on it, or in case of a draw, the fields ownership stays unclear causing this field not to produce points in the next round.

After all have been done, a new round begins, and the game goes on like this round by round.

14364,Welt 97,2004,1,3,0,2,2,30,30,,Collectible Components Dice Fantasy ,Dice RollingModular BoardTile Placement,"A unique collectible stickerstripgame with an epic fantasy background story, W97 is a new type of game for two players of ages 10+, which combines collecting and pasting of stickers with unusual game mechanisms.  In W97, players put together different sets of heroes, places, spells, victory conditions and much more based on a large supply of available stickers. The game is played on terrain strips, which are divided into five quadratic fields next to each other, where the stickers are placed.

Every player puts together an individual place- and hero-set for a game of W97. A place-set is made up of six terrain strips Forest, Water, Desert, Swamp, Mountains and Grassland, where the stickers of tower, ruin, castle, city, cave and temple, that have to be conquered, with different amount of points on them, individually are pasted on.

A hero-set is put together of different heroes, representing the leaders of each player's armies (which are available in the game as small colored wooden cubes, that are placed next to the strips), who have to be distributed among the six terrain strips as well.

In W97 no general victory conditions are available for both players. Each player must setup the best fitting victory conditions for their places and heroes in their own game-sets themselves.

Success and failure in W97 is determined by a well put together game-set, the strategy of the player and the overall luck of dice rolls.

New players will find an easy and fast introduction into W97 through the basic set, which comes with pre-configured, presorted strips for two players. It is even not necessary to paste stickers onto the terrain strips, because all places and heroes already have been printed together with the terrain types in advance. In addition the basic game includes 6x60 wooden cubes, five color dice, a German and an English rulebook each and a randomly chosen Expansion-Set.

From the back cover text:

Hex is a classic board game invented over half a century ago independently by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein and the Nobel Laureate John Nash. It has recently enjoyed a surge in popularity, and continues to fascinate mathematicians and game theorists with its duality of simple, elegant gameplay coupled with mathematically significant complexities. Hex Strategy: Making the Right Connections is the first book to offer a comprehensive look at the game, ranging from its history and mathematical underpinnings to advanced playing techniques. This book focuses on strategy from the player's perspective, and provides sufficient knowledge to play the game at a high level. Annotated sample games, puzzles, and numerous examples of an algorithmic approach to the game are provided, and discussions of strategy are profusely illustrated. Abstract board game players, recreational mathematicians, or simply those who enjoy games and puzzles of all kinds will be intrigued by the many facets of Hex covered in this book.

Players take turns to move around the board based on the results of a die roll.  On landing on a space, the nominated artist draws one card and starts sketching the category of word or phrase that is coded to the color of the space landed on.  The team has roughly one minute - the time it takes for a steel ball to run down the timer track - to guess the answer.  If the team guesses incorrectly, they lose their turn.  Certain spaces give an extra minute to guess or allows other teams to take part (and win the turn to move).

The first team to reach the ending spot wins the game.

14404,Thomas the Tank Engine Game,1986,3.60909,11,0,2,4,30,30,Children's,Children's Game Movies / TV / Radio theme Novel-based Trains ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"From a review by Charles Vasey:

Intended for Ages 5 - 11

The game is played on a board about a foot square. The four engines start at the sheds and must get to the station around the various lines and branch lines. There are three principle junctions and here may stand (in imposing black) the ample figure of The Fat Controller (the worthy Sir Topham Hatt). Engines may not go down the line blocked by The Fat Controller. However, a player whose engine lands on a yellow space (of which there are a number) must move The Fat Controller to another junction. Coming at a strategic moment this can send one's opponents off around a loop-line. There are also a number of spaces with special effects; 'Throw Again' and (very popular this one) 'Send any engine back to shed' are examples. Movement is regulated by a dice roll. Engines may pass each other but may not occupy the same space.

Undoubtedly a popular feature of Thomas the Tank Engine is the four little engine models executed in excellent detail in the predominant colour. The wheel arrangements are correct although it must be remarked that James The Red Engine (who is, you will remember, a Mixed Goods engine) lacks his tender. The four engines provided are Thomas, Percy, James and Toby, and the only complaint among my nephews was that there was no Gordon, Henry or Edward (I'm a Troublesome Truck man myself). Naturally I had to point out that the game board dipslayed Thomas' branch line, not the main line where extremely important engines would operate. I felt there was a ground swell here for an expansion kit.

Among its intended market the game is a great success but it is too simple other than for tinkering with by older gamers. Although, having said that, I have noticed it is a popular game for visitors to take down and play about with.

14405,Dail Eireann,1997,5.5,2,0,4,6,240,240,,Political ,Area-ImpulseDice Rolling,"A self-published game that shares components with Aras An Uachtaran, with both games being themed to Irish politics.

From a review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:

This is a 4 hour game, with each player taking the part of one of the groupings in the Irish parliament. Play is split into 15 rounds, in each of which players campaign and fight elections. Seats won translate into victory points (necessary, because this is a game in which the parties are not of equal strength and so each has its own conversion rate), and at the end the player with the highest number of victory points wins. Each party has a percentage share of the vote. At the start these range from 44 for Fianna Fail down to 3 for the Independents, but these will fluctuate during the game as a result of electoral successes and failures and the campaigning attentions of one's opponents. Each 5 per cent, or part thereof, that you have at the start of a round entitles you either to draw a constituency card or to place a marker on the board. Owning a constituency card enables you to decide when the election will be called for the seat, and having a marker in the constituency is necessary if you are to take part when it is.

An election can not be called if a constituency contains fewer than 3 markers. Markers once played can be moved, and there is a limit to the number of markers that can be in a constituency at any one time (with a Civilization-style combat mechanism for removing any surplus). All of which makes for a lot of tactical jostling. When an election is called, players with markers in the constituency collect votes equal to 1d6 plus the number of their markers. An overall majority is needed for victory, and votes of less successful candidates are reallocated until this is achieved. Reallocation is done using a preference list mechanism, which again offers a lot of scope for tactical maneuver.

14406,Aras An Uachtaran,1997,6.25,2,0,4,6,90,90,,Political ,Area-ImpulseDice RollingSet Collection,"A self-published game that shares components with Dail Eireann, with both games being themed to Irish politics.

From the review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:

Each player is a presidential candidate, with a playing piece that moves around the map picking up votes. Movement is by die roll. My first reaction when we started to play was that there was really nothing much to the game, but by the time we were a third of the way through, everyone was clearly having to think, I was enjoying myself and my opinion had been changed.

Three constituency cards are dealt face up by the board. The first candidate to visit the constituency collects the card and replaces it with another one from the deck. The object is to collect as many cards as you can and eventually an overall majority. Very much at the ``6 and up level so far. The fun again comes with the markers. When you collect a card you place one of your markers in the constituency, and on a turn when you fail to pick up a card you place one in a constituency of your choice. The effect of these is to slow down the movement of your rivals. The basic cost to move from one constituency to the next is one point from the die roll, but if you are trying to move into a constituency where some other player has more markers than you, you increase the cost by the number of markers you are behind the constituency leader.

So what starts as a level field soon develops some very adverse gradients, and regional fiefdoms begin to appear. If this were the only effect the markers had, the game would still be fairly straightforward, but it isn't. Once again, this is an Irish election, and a simple majority is not enough to become president; you need an overall one. So after all the cards have been picked up and a pecking order established on the first count, votes start being transferred. When a candidate is eliminated, the votes they had switch over on a constituency by constituency basis, going to whichever still active candidate has most markers in the constituency. The effect of this is that in the later stages of the game proper you have to start making choices. Do you place markers so as to impede your rivals, or do you start planning for the count? And if the latter, whose switches do you aim for? What looked easy at the start isn't any longer.

14407,Fastcard Soccer,1997,7.59091,11,1,1,2,10,10,,Sports ,Area MovementHand Management,"A representative of the 'replay' subgenre. Players run through a game of soccer using a deck of cards and a board, but have no actual control over the events in the basic game (though official variants included in the rule book *do* allow for choices on things like substitutions, making this a game)

From the review by Mike Siggins:

Ellis Simpson has been working on a soccer replay game for almost as long as I've known him. I think, having been privy to certain stages of its development, that the turning point came two years ago and Fastcard Soccer is the outcome. The resulting design emphasizes fast play (an admirable and difficult target), yet manages to retain many of the detailed trappings and flavour so important to the soccer fan. Well, this soccer game fan anyway. Like most replay games it is best enjoyed solitaire, but I have played some two-legged matches recently with a friend and these worked well enough. By way of a caution, please bear in mind throughout this review, as with Final Score, that I know next to nothing about football. What I feel I can comment upon is the atmosphere and game content of the system, and these are both first rate.

The system uses, predictably, a fast action card system that generates almost all of the action. Reference to charts is needed for goal attempts or unusual results (the infamous Z card effects) and the game status levels, essentially the team's overall ratings, are tracked on the pitch display using counters. The rest is a matter of choosing which teams you want to pair off, logging their ratings on the display, and playing the game.

The central structure, to a lazy bugger like me, seems like simplicity itself. Teams are rated for attack, defence and midfield. The latter ratings are compared to see which team wins possession and mounts an attack. A letter is read off, referenced to produce an attack number and then compared to the defence rating; if it is higher, the attack proceeds, if it is lower the attack breaks up, if equal there has been a clearance but the attacker retains possession. The whole setup runs on the highlight system by which, after each complete passage of play, a random number of minutes are marked off on the time display and the game runs through to 90 minutes, or longer if extra time is applicable. This method is now well established and it is an ingenious way of making sure that some ties have a lot of action and chances while other games are much like Arsenal at home to Arsenal. Game length will vary because of the use of highlights, but should take no more than a few minutes per match and it will get quicker as you become familiar with the card turning.

The big selling point for me is that the game features a commentary system that runs straight off the Fastcards themselves. As the attack builds up, you read a comment off the card that may go something like 'A flurry of passes wins a corner; a dipping cross into the box....'. The next card is flipped to reveal, say, 'A header from the back of the six yard box'. The header may go towards the corner of the goal, only to be saved spectacularly or any number of other possibilities. I may be a sucker for atmosphere, but at the speed this all runs (once you are used to the mechanics), it really conjures up the images for me. It is very much like watching the league goals on Match of the Day. Oddly, given one of my criticisms of Final Score, the speedy handling of this seems to negate the problem of not knowing who is on the ball. You can readily work out who has the goal attempt, but it doesn't seem to matter as much who brings the ball upfield.

The slight problem, and the only one in the game really, is that occasionally the commentary pairs don't seem to match up. Although this hasn't yet happened to me in about twenty games, other reviewers have mentioned it and I have seen it happen in the flesh. You might for instance get a header straight at the keeper, only to find him diving to get his fingertips to it. In this instance you can perhaps explain it away by a deflection or perhaps going the wrong way, but it does grate a little even for a man used to rationalising the weirdest German game systems. I can understand why this wasn't picked up (because of the large number of possible outcomes), but it must feel a little odd when it happens.

Players have to think of and write down a response befitting the person whose name they have drawn.  As each answer is read aloud, players record the name of the individual whom they believe correctly matches the response.  Correct matches are rewarded with points, which advance players around the board. Super Bitch cards add an element of chancethey can fast-track a player either forward or backwards. Which Bitch is Which? is a great party game that rewards perceptive observation and cunning responses.

Players are progressing their piece along a 83 space track. Pieces can be stacked up to 3 levels high. There are white, black and gray pieces scattered along the track.

Each piece's move is the piece's position (behind all players' pieces and stacks of pieces), times the piece position in a stack (1, 2 or 3). If it is on a white or black piece there as additional multiplier of x2 or x3. So one can complete the race in two giant moves if you are clever and lucky. Pieces must move between 1 and the full value available. Pieces that bolt way out in front tend to hang out there a while. Pieces that hang back can often make the biggest moves. Also if someone is on top of a piece it isn't moved, but every exposed piece must be moved every turn, so things don't usually stay blocked long.

There are 3 gray pieces that are worth 1, 2 and 3 VPs each and go to the first player to land on each. Otherwise there are 12 spots worth 12, 11, 10, etc VPS so you count the total of all the pieces VPs and add gray piece VPs to get a winner.

Jumps can be repeated, and maximal captures are mandatory. The first player unable to move loses.

He had switched sides the year before in an attempt to retain his throne, but he soon found that neither Austria nor Britain were willing to keep their promises. When Napoleon marched on Paris, Murat attacked the Austrians in Northern Italy. He was defeated in the battle of Tolentino on 2 May. He escaped to France, but Napoleon did not want his services. After Napoleons defeat at Waterloo, Murat returned to Italy, where he was executed in October 1815.

The not so well known battle of Tolentino is the subject of this game from Italian wargames magazine Alea iacta est. It includes one unmounted 42 x 58 cm map and 216 thin cardboard counters, all in full colour. One game turn represents 2 hours of real time, and one hex is 250 meters. The rules and the magazine are in Italian, but the rules are also available in English.

In the first half of the twentieth century, world chess champion Jose Raul Capablanca (1888-1942) apparently improved on Bird's variant by rearranging the order of the major pieces. This variant became known as Capablanca's Chess. And finally, in 1998, Ed Trice, founder of the Gothic Chess Federation, researched a setup which made a final improvement to Capablanca's arrangement, much as Capa had done for Bird.

14448,Immortals of Change,1985,7,2,0,2,2,30,30,,Action / Dexterity Science Fiction ,,"The follow up to Lakeside's action-strategy game Crossbows and Catapults, Immortals of Change takes the same basic gameplay and puts a futuristic twist on it. The object of the game is the same: players take turns using weapons (both pivoting and forward firing, which amount to high-tech catapults and crossbows, respectively) to shoot projectiles at their opponent's forces. The prime target for these projectiles (and they are quite literally shot, using rubber-band powered mechanisms) are the five boundary sensors, which hide behind and around Protective Barriers and Battle Fortresses. The first to destroy all five wins.

However, unlike Crossbows and Catapults, the weapons in Immortals of Change can be built into different configurations. While additional combinations are possible, the base Battle Set promotes five different official combinations: Battle Falcon, Bull Rover, Big Strut, Battle Creeper, and Robot. Each combination has both strengths and weaknesses. Additional expansion sets allow even more formations, objectives, and scenarios.

From the box:

In a different time, enemy warriors will do battle using strange and menacing weapons. You are the commander of your forces, your opponent, the commander of his. Both commanders have great arsenals of weapons that convert from offensive to defensive weapons as the tides of battle change. But the one who possesses the greater skill and better strategy will conquer.

Immortals of Change - The fun is only limited by your imagination.

Players represent insurance companies who compete to insure bond issues sold by municipal governments.  Just as in real life, one issuer may sell more than one bond issue, each of which might be insured by a different insurance company.  The 36 different issuers have different probabilities of default, with riskier issues represented by dice faces with numerically higher values. Riskier issuers pay higher premiums to their insurance company, but also have a greater chance of defaulting and causing the insurer to pay a claim.  Most money at the end wins.

The box claims the game is for ages 14 and up, but it's more straightforward than that.  And although knowledge of the market for financial guaranties is not necessary to win INSURE!, some familiarity with it and its specialized terminology may add to your fun.

For example, the three Daisy Duck Aches and Pains cards depict her head looking dizzy, her body shivering, and her feet in a tub of hot water. These all connect to form one full-body picture. The three all better cards show the same three body parts but the character is smiling and healthy. Typically, a game involves spinning a spinner that selects a character, flipping up an All Better card in hopes of finding a card for that character, and (if a match is made) placing the All Better card over the corresponding Aches and Pains card to heal the character.

Contents: Board (which is also the game box), 3 special D6 dice and chips. The board has a treasure map pictured on it. There is a treasure chest in the center and 4 'betting corners' - one with a picture of a pistol, another with a picture of a cannon, another a trumpet and the last a sword. The chips come in white (worth 1 pt.), black (2 pts.) and gold (3 pts.). The die faces for each die show one each of the 4 betting corner items, a treasure chest and a map (which acts as a joker).

Object: To be the last player with chips.

Distribute the chips evenly among the players. Before each player's turn, all players place 1 chip (value 1) on each betting corner. Player keeps rolling until she wins chips or passes. On your turn: Roll the dice. If all three are treasure chests, take all chips on the treasure chest. (This only applies to 3 treasure chests thrown on the first roll.) If all three are the same betting item, take all chips from the corresponding betting corner and your turn is over. If the roll has different betting items, you can set aside one kind and re-roll the rest. You must put one chip (value 1) on each betting corner that corresponds to the face of a die you will re-roll. (ex: You roll a cannon, a sword and a trumpet. You choose to keep the sword, pay 1 pt to the cannon corner, pay 1 pt to the trumpet corner and re-roll.) As long as you don't win, you can continue to pay 1 point to the appropriate corner(s) for each die re-rolled. Once you have three of the same betting item, take all chips on that item and your turn is over. For each treasure chest rolled, every player (including you) puts 1 point on the treasure chest. You can stop rolling and pass at any time. A player who runs out of chips is out of the game.

Bidding is normal except that the players can see all the cards in both their hands. The only other difference is that the declarer does not lay down his dummy's cards but shows them one at a time per trick: otherwise three entire hands would be exposed to the declarer's opponent (and thus make the game pointless).

The game is helpful for beginners trying to get a grasp of the bidding process, but also fun for experts who want to calculate their bids with full knowledge of two hands.

The board depicts a baseball field dotted with lights that give the results of a play. The players use switches located at either end of the board for each pitch. For example, if the player batting presses the #2 button, and the player in the field presses the #4 button, the Strike lamp would light up, while a combination of #6 and #4 would result in the triple lamp lighting. Each player also has A and B switches that are pressed to light the Safe or Out lamps needed for the results of some plays (like if a runner tries to steal 2nd base). Wooden cubes are used to represent base runners. The player with the most runs scored at the end of 9 innings wins. Extra innings are played if needed.

History:

An application for a U.S. patent was filed in December 1927 by James M. Prentice of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Prentice was 17 years old. The patent, for Electric Baseball, was granted less than a year later, and Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, under a variety of titles and in a variety of forms, would go on to a production run of more than thirty years.

Prentice initially sold, or at least licensed, the rights to his invention to Parker Brothers, the game-publishing giant of nearby Salem -- probably to help fund his college tuition at the University of New Hampshire, whence he graduated with a degree in mathematics. Parkers produced Electric Base Ball Game, arguably the first electrical boardgame ever, in the very early 1930s. (Source)

Players buy shares in 10 English railway companies, build routes between cities, buy up old historical lines, and receive income. The most notable change to the game system present here is the end game, where the previously placed lines are privatized via a closed fist auction.

The game focuses on the transition from the private railroad companies to their consolidation as a consortium (similar to Lnderbahnen), a process that makes for a challenging game, primarily suitable for advanced economic gamers.

The game came in a large manila envelope. It came with 4 large blue-print card stock star maps, a small rule book, and four sets of tables and record sheets in plastic covers to allow writing with grease pencils. Each set had a star system record sheet, a distance chart, a ships log, and a Ship Statistics Table. Players had to provide a die and grease pencils.

The die was only used to determine the number of planets at each star explored. There were no other random elements in the game.

Each turn the players would write movement orders for their ships. Then if players encountered each other at a star combat could be resolved. Finally minerals would be collected at each controlled planet and loaded on transports for shipping to industrial planets for construction of ships.
Each player kept all their activities secret on their record sheets, and the dice-less system of resolving combat allowed the players to know how many ships the opponent had in a combat, but not what type.

The game worked best when there was a referee processing the players' input, and thus was very amenable to play by mail. However it could also be played without a referee.
The game also included rules for alternate species that had special abilities and significantly different motivations, represented by different victory conditions.

It uses the same board and playing pieces (to represent hounds and jackals), but with a changed rules set.

In the original game, players move their pieces based on the results of a randomizer (in modern days, a die is used), and their goal is to remove their pieces from the board by moving them to the final space on the track (above the tree).  In Hunde und Schakale, the movement of a piece depends on the positions of the other pieces on the board; a piece that moves next to an opponent's forces that opposing piece to be moved in the opponent's next turn.

The goal in the German interpretation is to force your opponent to move all his or her pieces to their final five spots at the end of their track, and thus winning you the game.

The statistics of the historical runners have been modified so that they can compete with the current racers.

Components are the rule book (a5 format), 7 sections of 'track' , four charts (summary, race pace/progress record and timing charts for 1500m and mile), 36 cards for runners and record sheets for races and a training log for the optional campaign rules. Four dice (two yellow, red and green)and two counters are also supplied. 
(Extract of the following review)

The Metric Mile has long been a favorite game of many gamers, and not all of them sports replay gamers as it appears from time to time in all sorts of 'best games ' lists. Frequently played at conventions as a multi-player game, and the subject of many postal games in days gone by, the game was designed way back in 1986 as no more than another solo replay game, and its appeal to all shapes and sizes of gamers surprised me then and continues to do so. Or maybe not quite so much as it did, for I have to say that when I worked on it again recently ...

... I appreciated the quick easy-to-understand-but-difficult-to-suss-out game system that does in fact produce races over this classic track distance ( one mile and 1,500 Metres, despite the title) that are accurate and realistic and yet require a lot of on-the-fly decisions for each runner.

There are some minor extra rules: if you roll three smileys you get to take one back from the center/cookie jar, but that only happens 1 in 216 rolls. You also must roll all smileys to win the game, instead of just winning when you're the last one with chips/cookies. If the final cookie must go in the center/cookie jar, the game is a draw and you must start all over. Finally, there is a scorepad - you cross off one cookie for winning and an extra one if you had more than one cookie left when you won. Essentially, it is LCR with a theme.

Subtitled both Pacific War in Another World and From Surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor by US Navy to Decisive Battle of Marshall. The box cover has a dramatic picture of the Japanese battleship Nagato slowly turning on its side and billowing smoke while US dive bombers fly overhead ala the USS Arizona. An eye-grabber indeed!

There are four maps in this game, making it the largest AT game size-wise. The maps stretch from Calgary, Canada to Tienching, China and from Attu in the Aleutian Islands to Tahiti in the Society Islands at a scale of 100km per hex. There are 756 counters, ranging from US and Japanese divisions to Chinese and Russian Corps. Even the Germans are represented by the 5th Light and 15th Panzer divisions! There are four PACs (two sets of two identical), some representing task force boxes and the others charts and tables (of which there are many). There is a 32-pg History booklet, along with a 40-pg rulebook.

The game itself has 26 pgs of actual rules and nine scenarios. Turns are ten days (three per month) and lasts from Dec. of 41 through August of 42. The game is decided by Victory Points, which are accrued by ownership of geographic objectives and multiplied by the current value for the turn (VPs x5 early on and going to only x1 starting about halfway through the game). Plane counters are of the change variety, while capital ships are individual and smaller vessels are grouped together.

This has apparently always been a popular title in Japan and commands quite a good price over there (20,000+ JPYN) for mint copies.

The game consists of four 12-Card suits and one 4-card independent suit. The cards are ordered from greatest to least, and are used to take tricks.

The four independent cards are Master Mind, District Attorney, X Marks the Spot (opening trick card), and Public Enemy (no value during play, but scores points when captured)

Points are scored for taking tricks, and, more importantly, taking tricks with certain cards in them. Bonus points are awarded for capturing the Public Enemy. Capturing the Public Enemy scores and Indictment, with three such Indictments scoring a Conviction, with the reward of enough bonus points to usually win the game.

Players roll a die to move around board collecting power tokens.  If they land on a battle square, they draw a battle card and follow the instructions--most, if not all, cards call for one or more power tokens to be discarded.  Once a player has a set of all five tokens they may attempt to enter the central track to fight the Green Goblin.  This is accomplished by using a special piece of apparatus: the Battle Wall.  This consists of a 3-D office building with a spinner attached to the base.  The spinner is spun and a button in the center is pressed whenever the player wishes.  The button causes either Spider-Man or the Green Goblin to pop out of one side or the other of the building.  If Spider-Man comes out, the game is over and that player wins.  If the Green Goblin comes out, the player must make one more circuit of the board before they may try again.  Youngest player moves first, according to the rules, so perhaps there's a very slight German influence here?

The turn player rolls an 8-sided die, and the result of the die roll is then auctioned using a silent bid (written on pieces of paper). The high bid wins but pays the second highest amount (like Knizia's Last Paradise), and that player can move one of their pawns the die roll amount. Money is paid to the die roller, unless they win in which case they pay the bank. Rolls of seven and eight have special properties. Moves can be made forward and backward, and this is relevant since when landing on another player's pawn, that owner of the pawn hit pays 50 points to the mover.  There are bonuses for finishing in first, second, and third place also.

14679,Char,1993,6.95,10,0,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Pattern Building,"Char is a three dimensional alignment game similar to the many flavors of 3D tic-tac-toe that have appeared over the years.  Its rules and production values raise it above the level of these titles, however.

Rules: The play space is a 4x4x4 volume.  Players alternate placing black and white pieces into the volume; the goal is to create a row of four like-colored pieces either orthogonally or diagonally within any plane of the space.  What makes the game unique is the pieces: There are whole pieces shaped like solid disks, and half pieces that are either rings or nubs that fit into the ring's center.  Discs count as either other type; a valid row contains either rings and/or disks OR nubs and/or disks.  It is allowed to place, for instance, your nub into an opponent's ring (quiet, you!).  Therefore, potential lines can intersect one another.  Furthermore, the pieces must be played in rotation, i.e. white disk, black disk, then white ring, black ring, then white nub, black nub; then again from the top.

Production: the board is a very nicely designed laser-cut acrylic affair, with two supports that slot into one another, and etched levels that rest on the arms of the supports.  The pieces are molded of black and white plastic.  Molded clear trays are provided to keep the pieces sorted in the proper playing order.

Also included is a patently ridiculous but highly amusing booklet about the game's history full of quotes from fictitious Zen masters and a bibliography of alleged texts about the game and its historical significance.

This was Games Magazine's Best Abstract Strategy Game for 1993 and Mensa Select for 1994.

The game consists of an 8 second sand timer and 200 oversize cards each depicting either the top half or the bottom half of a colorful and humorous cartoon animal (such as Titus the skateboard riding elephant, Dolly the hula dancing penguin, or Howie the hockey playing monkey).  Play progresses as each player in turn draws a card from the shuffled deck and places it in plain view on the table. The player who's turn it is then has 8 seconds to find a matching pair of cards anywhere on the table and yell Connexus before play moves on to the next player.  But there's a catch!  Not every matching pair of cards will correctly fit together, as each card has either a tab or a slot on the edge where the two cards join.  For a match to count, one card must have a tab and the other a slot.    Legal matches are immediately removed from the board, however, mistakenly yelling Connexus without being able to make a match causes the player to forfeit one previously completed match.  Gameplay continues until one player has reached a predetermined number of matches.

The fast pace and the challenge of seeing and remembering all the cards and being able to locate them quickly enough to ensure that a potential matching pair will fit together are what make this game so exiting for all players involved.  Players must constantly be aware of their own cards as well as the other players' cards at all times in order to make matches.

I believe only a few proof of concept prototypes of this game were ever published which is a real shame because this game is one that can truly be enjoyed and played competitively by players of any age.

The setting for the game is that Germany won WW2 (conquered Europe) due to Japan not attacking the USA and we both stayed neutral while Japan picked up territorial concessions. Now it is 1948 and Germany and Japan are about to fight it out for control of the Indian subcontinent. The USA is on Japans side in the conflict.

The maps go from Turkey and Egypt to Burma. Ground units are divisions, capital ships are shown individually, and air units are about 30 planes each. The rules state that all three types of combat (air, land, naval) are represented equally and there is a form of programmed instruction here in that there is a separate naval and ground game, with the relevant air rules being included in each.

One of the more innovative rules that I remember reading was that combat was preformed in-hex. Supply points play a key role in the game, as they determine who is allowed to do what on any given turn.

It is basically a roll and move game, with a number of cards that can be played at various times to enhance one's own progress or inhibit that of the another player.

4.      The Reader reads the clue with the same number that the player on the Readers left chose.
5.      After listening to the clue, the player has 10 seconds to guess the Readers identity.  Players may only guess on their turn, and must choose a clue before guessing.

    If the player guesses correctly, the player and the Reader determine their score (see Scoring, below), and move their playing pieces.  The player on the Readers right becomes the new Reader.

The Reader receives 1 point (moves forward one space) for every number that is covered with a chip.  The Guesser receives 1 point for each unused chip.

Special Clues:

     When the Reader reads One free guess anytime, the player guesses immediately, and then takes a Free Guess Chip.  Players with Free Guess Chips play them before the start of another players turn, and then guess.  After playing a Free Guess Chip, players return it to the edge of board.
     Lose your turn means that play passes immediately to the next player  the current player may not guess.
     Players move their pieces after hearing Go ahead and Go back clues, then guess.  No player may be moved back from Start.
     Players who receive a Choose a player to move clue may move any players piece except their own.
     Guess now and pick another number allows the player a free guess, before choosing a clue.  After the free guess, the same player chooses another number, listens to the clue, and guesses again.




 
Bonus Round: 
Any time that players end their move on a Bonus Space they may play a Bonus Round.  To play a Bonus Round, the Reader chooses a card from the deck and identifies it as a Person, Place, Thing or Year.  The Bonus Player announces 5 numbers, one at a time, which the Reader reads as they are chosen.  The Bonus Player may guess after hearing any of the 5 clues, but may only guess once during the Bonus Round.
 If the Bonus Player correctly guesses the Readers identity after just one clue, the Bonus Player moves ahead 10 spaces.  If the Bonus Player needs more clues, scoring is as follows:
2 clues = 8 spaces
3 clues = 6 spaces
4 clues = 4 spaces
5 clues = 2 spaces
 When players land on a Bonus Space during the middle of a turn, the Reader continues with the card in play until a player guesses correctly, then starts the Bonus Round.  The Bonus Round ends if the Bonus Player chooses the Lose your turn clue.  The Bonus Player moves on Go Ahead and Go Back clues, then the Bonus Round continues.  The Reader does not move during a Bonus Round.
 Winning the Game:
The first player to reach Finish wins the game.  Players need not land exactly on Finish to win.

Each player gets a pawn and chooses a starting position. Then players take turns moving their pawns from block to any adjoining block, trying to capture opponents by going onto the same block with them, until only one player remains on the field.

Every five turns one player chooses a block to remove from the playing field, so the field is reconfigured throughout the game (because fewer and fewer blocks remain). This ensures that the game never ends in a draw and provides additional strategy opportunities. The game set includes an extra pawn and a move counter to help keep track of who makes every fifth move.

There are no random events in the game, the outcome is entirely based on players' skill.

The rules specify some restrictions for building the playing field to prevent the person who constructs it from gaining an unfair advantage.

On the game board you can see the witches forest with the witch school in the corner. Little witches go there every day to practice their tricks. It takes a lot of practice to be a good witch! Today, all the little witches are allowed to practice their tricks in the forest.
If they pass their witches test, they will receive a delicious spider cake for their hard work.
All of the important things a good witch needs are hidden under orange stones in the big fire where the witches dance. To pass the witches test, you must know what is under each stone. But watch out! There is a wicked witch hiding somewhere. If you uncover her, you must go all the
way back to the space behind the last player. Each of you junior witches should pay close attention during the game. The first student to reach one of the spider cakes wins the game.

To play the game:
Each player chooses a witch playing figure and places it on
the witch school in the top left corner of the playing board. This is the starting space. In the witches fire, you
will see everything a good witch needs: a black cat, a raven, a toad, a book of spells, a bat, a magic wand, a magic hat, a broom and a cauldron.
For about 15 seconds, the children should carefully look at
the 10 stones in the witches fire and try to remember where everything is located.
Then the stones should be turned over.

Throw the dice and see what colour you rolled. The spaces in the witches forest correspond to the colours on the dice. Move your witch to the next space of the same colour you rolled. Look at the picture on the space where you landed. Can you remember where the same picture is located
under the orange stones? If you choose the right stone, your witch can stay on that space. If you choose the wrong stone, your witch must GO BACK.
Return to the first space you come to that corresponds
to the colour on the dice (at the beginning, simply return
to the witch school). Dont go back to the space you just
came from!
But watch out! If you accidentally turn over the wicked
witch , you must go all the way back to the playing
space behind the last witch (it does not matter what
colour that space is).

The mechanics are simple roll-and-move, but the game board gives players a detailed look at the many steps a bill must take between being introduced and being signed into law.

Each player starts by sponsoring a bill in either the Senate or House, and is encouraged to declare the subject and intent of the bill aloud for flavor. It then wends its way, 2D6 at a time, through obstacles such as committee hearings and filibusters, and when it succeeds in passing one chamber, it starts over in the other. After approval of both Senate and House, it makes its way 1D6 at a time toward final signing.

Players get one Parliamentary Procedure Card at game start, and may pick up Congressional Record cards along the way. Some of these have instructions (go forward or back x spaces), but others are negotiable. Like the Parliamentary Procedure cards, these provide benefits like getting reported out of committee, ending an opponent's turn, ducking a filibuster and avoiding the deadly Red Circle spaces that kill your bill and send it back to start over. Players may trade such cards at any time.

Included are 4 dragster Control Consoles, 88 play cards, 80+ counters, the track, dice, and four custom miniatures representing the dragsters.

This game plays a bit like Robo Rally lite, with players selecting cards in secret and arranging them in the order they are to be revealed to determine their dragsters' movement for the turn. The number of cards, from 1 to 3, each player selects, and when they are revealed, depends on the speed of his/her dragster, which generally increases from the start line. As dragsters collide with each other, they are knocked off course, and may rebound from the walls of the track. Each dragster has a supply of mines and missiles, as well as a certain amount of power for shields to deflect hits. Before the race starts, each player customizes his/her dragster with one secret piece of equipment which confers a special ability.

The winner is either the player to cross the finish line first, or the only player to survive the battling for position along the way.

This demo game was produced in a set of 150 and distributed at conventions to test the waters for a full-size Great Space Race game in the future.

Both players play simultaneously, so it is basically a guessing game of trying to anticipate where your opponent will move.  If your creature ends up adjacent to your opponent's creature AND is facing it, then you inflict a hurt on your opponent.  It takes 3 hurts to win.

Some of the creatures have different abilities, including armor (blocks an attack), more agility (can turn 180 degrees instead of just 90), or multiple attacks (like the Stegosaurus who can attack with his head or his tail).

When a development is completed, the rules allow the acting player to swap markers with those of other players in adjacent spaces, subject to certain limitations, thus expanding his control over the local area. At the end of the game, victory points  are awarded for each development a player controls, with the more advanced developments scoring more points.

The goal of COMPULSION is to manage $20,000 into a small fortune.  Strategies of conservative patience are pitted against those of high risk brinkmanship, as profits are realized through shrewd investment in the REAL WORLD, disciplined wagering at the TRACK, or natural luck in either sphere.  While players may choose to concentrate in one area, it is likely that they will test their skills and develop personal strategies for success both in REAL LIFE and at the TRACK.  However, certain compulsions, combined with the defensive play of others, may continually threaten even the best laid plans.

The game comes in a small box with rules, 20 service cards, 32 play cards, and score keeping sheets.

Instead of the standard suits and numbers in a 52-card deck, Belisha's cards can be grouped into numbers, colors, and types of traffic signs.

Per Rummy, the players are dealt a hand of cards and at the beginning of their turn, draw a card from the deck or the first card of the discard pile.  Their aim is to get rid of the cards from their hand by playing them in sets or straight sequences.  They can play their cards to extend sets or sequences laid out by their opponents.  They must also discard one card in their turn.  The current round stops when a player has played or discarded his last card.  Players sum up the values of the remaining cards in their hands as their score for the round and begin the next by reshuffling the deck and dealing new hands.

The game ends when a player has accumulated a certain score (usually 250) or more.  At that point, the player with the lowest accumulated score is the winner.

Players are faced with more than 200 questions in English, with translations in the dominant languages of Zulu, Sesotho and Afrikaans, such as: When I think of someone dying, I ...; The thing about HIV/AIDS that scares me most is ... and My favorite TV program is ...

The following disclaimer appears on the box: Neither United States Marine Corps nor any other component of the Department of Defense has approved, endorsed, or authorized this product.  The game is generally a trivia game.  Players earn chips by answering questions in three categories--History, EST, and Trivia.  It's also possible to earn medals and promotions by landing on certain spaces, which are also worth chips.  Players must attempt to reach the star in the center of the board.  Of those who reach it, the player with the most chips is the winner.  There are also chances to gamble chips in an attempt to earn more.  Unfortunately the copy of the game I won in an auction didn't come with rules so I can't really be more clear.

Each of the 500 cards has 4 trivia questions on it.  Players decide before the game starts whether they will read through all four before replacing each card or not.  Each question has multiple choice answers and is worth a number of points specified on the card.  Each correct answer allows the player or team's token to be moved that many spaces.  24 seconds is recommended as the time limit for answering.  Some spaces on the board have special instructions that must be followed (lose a turn, move ahead two, that sort of thing.)  Variant games are also suggested in the rules, such as rolling the die (provided with the game) to determine movement instead of taking the point value from the card.

Contents:
36 numbered picture cards (numbered 1-10)
10 Ooky Spooky cards

Play:

The object of the game is to use all of the cards in your hand.

The game contains two sets of rules. One set involves open play and the other set bluffing/closed play.

Because of the simple nature of the game it is possible for players to invent countless variants around the given rule sets.

The central themes are that, after the initial play, players (in turn) may place 1 or 2 cards that add up to or exceed by one, the value of the preceding player's last card (i.e. the top card).

The second theme of the game is the Ooky Spooky (Ghost) card which spooks the next player into missing a go (and picking up two more cards).

The game has attractive graphics and thick cards (more like tiles).

The box states Ages 5 - 9, but the game(s) could have wider appeal.

Easily expanded by buying another box.

There are 34 tiles, each containing four squares and either red or yellow colored walls.  A 6 by 6 frame is assembled, and each player takes turns placing two tiles at a time to build the maze, leaving two empty spots.  The maze tiles contain 12 energy points of each color.  Unlike Double Morphus, the maze is not three dimensional.

Each player has 3 guards and a trover.  The object of the game is to collect all energy points of a player's given color, or to capture the opponent's trover.

On each turn, a player may move all of his pieces 10 squares each.  Guards may move orthogonally only, and trovers may move both orthogonally and diagonally.  Only trovers may collect energy points.  Guards serve to block movement.

Energy points may be spent to morph a maze tile by sliding it into an adjacent empty square.  Each point spent allows two such morphs.  Tiles containing a trover may not be morphed.

To capture an opposing trover, it must be immobilized by a combination of enemy guards, walls, empty space, or enemy energy points for one full turn.  A trover can force itself past an enemy guard by surrendering either an energy point or the life of a friendly guard.

When a new system is explored, a card is drawn to determine its value; there may be native forces or other things to be dealt with.  In the basic game, there are two forces - the black and the red.  The black has large numbers, while the red has a much smaller fleet of faster ships.  Speed is very important, since faster ships can retreat from combat from slower ones unless attackers move in from all six adjacent hexes. The red force also has battlecruisers, which have the speed of a cruiser and nearly the combat strength of a battleship. There is a blue fleet for a third player, identical to the red fleet.

In addition to spaceships, there are several types of ground forces with which to contend for control of systems.

The map has star systems scattered across it, and many nebulae, which slow movement.

14810,Never Say Die,1959,4.33333,3,0,3,8,0,0,,Dice ,Dice Rolling,"The object of this game is to win as many chips as possible.  Three special six-sided dice are used; each dice has three red letters (an L, a C, and an R) along with three black dots.  Players start with three chips.  Each rolls the dice (never any more dice than chips) and distributes chips according to the roll, either to the player on the left, the center (pot), the player on the right, or no action if a black dot is rolled.  Play continues clockwise.  Players without chips can stay in the game because the rolls of others may give them some chips (hence the name of the game), but must pass on their roll.

Never Say Die, published in 1959, was republished almost exactly in 1992 as LCR.  There are two rules in Never Say Die that are missing in LCR.  First, players may permanently retire any number of chips over three that they own as individual winnings.  Second, the winner of the pot in Never Say Die is the player who holds the last chip not in the pot and who rolls a C.  It's possible that a player will hold the last two or even the last three chips not in the pot; in this case she may be fortunate enough to roll nothing but C's and work all her chips to the center to win.  If the player holding the last chip rolls a dot, she keeps rolling until she gets a letter.  The winner starts the next game.

This boxed game included a plastic dice cup (with snap-on lid), three dice, 24 large chips, and instructions.

G-Barbarossa covers the German offensive of 1941 and the Soviet counter attack of Winter 1941-1942. Soviet units have been treated in a unique way, in that the second step strength of a two step unit varies and is unknown to all players until the unit is reduced. For example: a 3 strength infantry unit's second step may reveal itself to be: two, one or * (annihilation!). Soviet leaders are treated in a similar way, with ratings of: 3 (Zhukov only), 2, 1, 0 and *, being revealed to all players only at the moment of battle. Leaders have combat strength and command control ability equal to their rating, and they keep units in supply up to the number of hexes equal to their rating. A leader with a rating of 1 exerts command control into adjacent hexes, a leader with 0 has no combat strength but gives supply to units in the same hex and a * leader is removed before combat, thereby having no effect. Only German panzer corps have a second turn phase, allowing them to exploit breakthroughs. The turn sequence changes in Winter for the Soviet counter attack.

By 1922, the British, French and Italians had long abandoned the Greek Army's occupation of some 400 km in Turkey. Originally planned to recover the spoils of WW1 when Turkey surrendered, the Allied powers had promised Greece a part of Turkey, which the Greeks claimed was part of Greater Greece. The Greeks by the Summer of 1921, had advanced to within 30 km of Ankara, there the critical battle of the Sakarya River ended the advance. The failure of the battle now turned public opinion at home and amongst troops in Turkey against the war. From 1921 to 1922, the Greek Asia Minor Army held a 400 km front line. The Greeks were hoping and desperately looking for a honorable way out of the mess that the British had got them in. Greece was going broke because of the war and depended on England to provide monetary loans. Greek morale wavered.

The Turks under Mustapha Kemal (Ataturk) were about to give a good reason for the Greeks to leave.

The game is operational, 2 miles a hex, battalions and regiments. In all, 280 counters and 11x17 inch color map. Units have two combat strengths and there are two movement phases. Reserves are important. Supply is critical. Units include infantry, cavalry, artillery, aircraft and HQ's. Each turn is 12 hrs. There are two games, the campaign from August 26 to 31st and The Pocket, where five Greek divisions are trapped from August 29-31. The game is not complex and can be completed in two hours.

A collection of polyglot men with dubious training and questionable morale. Some 60,000 of them. Time was running out as the Fall weather set in, both sides knew it. Lenin and Trotsky began the ultimate propaganda campaign to stir the emotions of the peasant workers. Free food and clothing was the lure to fight. Thousands enlisted. For Denikin, he instinctively knew time was short for a variety of reasons and thus launched the, To Moscow offensive on Oct 6th. The White player will also feel the pressure of time. The Red player will toss anything and everything to delay and play for time! 
200 Miles covers this epic offensive in a unique game design capturing the essence of the battle and the differences between the forces. Use of supply and command is important. The technological edge of the White forces is fragile, yet potent, if it can be harnessed. Cavalry remains the fast moving forces for both sides.

It was Syria's Kursk-like battle. Over 100 T-62 and T-55 tanks faced a paltry 20 IDF Centurion tanks, many short of ammunition. It was David vs. Goliath in modern day terms. The only thing the IDF had going for it was the 12 foot deep anti-tank ditch and the three tiered ramp positions for the tanks. The Valley of Tears remains perfect tank country, flat with long range of fire. To add to the confusion, the IDF patch quilt of forces all operated on different radio frequencies making any coordination impossible. For the Syrian, the AT ditch, which stretched out along the front was also littered with mines. Crossing it under fire would prove to be daunting using the mobile bridge laying equipment. Of course, they has Sagger AT missiles, greatly outnumbered the IDF and air support.

Game scale is 200 yds a hex, individual tanks, 20 minute turns, squads of infantry. Over 300+ counters and color 11x17 map. Rules cover Saggers, Artillery, Aircraft, Ammo limits, Forward Observers, extensive use of commands, mines, bridgelayers and more.

14838,Little Stalingrad Komsomolskoye March 2000,2001,6.33333,3,0,2,2,8,8,Wargames,Modern Warfare Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Komsomolskoye was the horrific scene of a grueling two week battle. In a historical sense, it was a Little Stalingrad as the Russians attempted to retake the small town of 5000 people at the foothills of the Black Mountains. Over 2000 Russians and 800 Chechens would lose their lives there. The urban setting littered with many brick and stone buildings with deep basements made for a bloody fight. On March 5th, the Chechen forces seized the town from the Russians and held on until the 15th. Every building would be a war. The Russians pounded the town with artillery, air and Mi-24 gunships creating simply more and more rubble. More Chechens arrived and by the 9th, some 1500 were in the town. Each basement had become a bunker. Russian elite troops were sent in, including Russia's recent new air-fuel weapon, the dreaded Buratino and Schmel. T-72's were sent in firing at point blank range towards the buildings. It was a messy battle and both sides were determined to win and the Russians had just been obliterated near Ulus-Kert on Hill 776 losing its whole 6th Paratroop company!

Depicts what many call the most devastating battle after Grozny. Situated at the base of the Black Mountains, this small town of 5000 became for focal point of two desperate military machines. In early March, a weak Russian security force assumed control of the town. The Chechen forces were very close by and desperate. The Russian war machine had been ripping them apart. Taking advantage of the situation, the 500 man force attacked the town and wiped out the Russians. Beginning on the 6th, the Russian military made six attempts to seize the town, all failed. Artillery, airstrikes, T-72 tanks and Buratino's were called in. It was a sledgehammer. The Chechen force withstood this using underground pillboxes in the stone buildings, and by the 12th, the town was in ruin and the Russians still remained along the perimeter. The Chechen force somehow had received reinforcements and now swelled to 1500 hardened armed fighters. They had laid mines. From the 12th to 17th, Russian forces fought and ugly brutal urban battle with a cunning foe.

The game comes with a 11x17 map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about 200 yards per hex. Each combat unit is one platoon. A game turn is one day of time.

A simple cooperative adventure game with a basic Dungeon and Dragon aim : get to the castle and pillage it without being killed by various monsters.

Sitting between a role-playing-game and a board game, this was meant as an introductory RPG which could be played with or without a dungeon master. At the start of the game, players select a character among four classes (warrior, wizard, cleric, and thief) and chose one of four weapons (dagger, sword, club, and bow).

Players make their way towards the castle either alone or as a group by moving on the game board. On this board, they step onto circle, triangle or square spaces which determine encounters through the roll of a six-sided die. No events or encounters are associated with circle spaces.

Triangle space die roll
1-4: Nothing
5: 1 Random monster
6: 2 Random monsters or 1 monster and 1 treasure

Square space die roll
1-3: Nothing
4: 1 Random monster
5: 2 of any random combination of monsters and treasures 
6: 3 of any random combination of monsters and treasures

Certain treasures can only be acquired once players have made their way inside the castle.

For every monster encounter, players can either fight or flee. Both options are resolved through dice rolls.

If it's not, the player who owns the die must pay the pot the number on the die.  You may then take the pot and end your turn, or choose two new dice belonging to other players and roll them.  You continue taking one more die each round until you choose to stop or crash.

Bogart is an earlier version of Crash.

Crash was included in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.

There is NO 'creative credit' or 'designed by' information to be found within this but there is a 'Catalog' Number: #4410:29. I would believe that a more appropriate 'Name' should have been applied, as I'll explain in greater detail. The contents and components are ALL Inclusive within the game box 'Bottom', and it does have a colorful box top cover, with the dimensions of 6-inches by 9-inches, while this is around 1/2-inch in it's 'depth'-in ALL of it's 'connotations'! This consists of '5' Lanes of different COLORS-with numbers also-and being '7' spaces long, along with '5' metal cast, thin, sliding 'Cars' for each 'Lane', the 'Spinner', and with the Instructions printed in the upper left hand corner in very small print at that. There is also an artistic BLACK  WHITE drawing of 1950s era 'Stock Cars' just below the LANES, and where the 'Spinner' has been placed, in the lower right corner. Of the 'Cars' included, '4' of them are painted BLACK with the 'lone' WHITE Car-who knows WHY they did this or didn't paint them UP with even MORE different COLORS?
To PLAY: Spin the 'Spinner' and whichever Car's number/color is chosen, then MOVE it '1'-space and continue to perform this until a 'Winner' is determined. Since there is NOT an entire 'Race Track', but just the short 'Lanes' portion of one, then maybe they should have considered THIS as 'Drag Racing' instead, I know that I would have. I will include some photos of this once it has been accepted.

Dogfight was originally conceived as a collectible dice game called Zodiac in which twelve unique characters were composed of sets of three custome 8-sided dice.  The idea of characters made from dice was later restructured and published as Button Men.  The original client decided not to buy Zodiac, and it was revamped as Battlin' Dice for another uninterested client and later printed as Dogfight in the Origins 2000 preregistration book.

Players roll dice to move around an outer (primaries) track, then an inner (election) track toward the final election space. A player who lands on an election space rolls 2d6 three times and collects a card if he gets 8+ twice. Land on Campaign, Power or Delegate and take a corresponding card. On a Power or Roll-Off square, the player can challenge an opponent for 1-2 matching cards; highest on 2D6 wins; defender wins ties.

To move up to the Election track, the player must turn in 2 Election cards, 4 Campaign cards and 4 matching delegates (same party, all four regions). The player turns them all in and starts collecting again on the inner track.

With another full set (delegates must be from the same party as before), the player gets to roll some more: he and the player with the most Delegate cards roll off 2D6 five times. If the player trying to get elected wins 3/5 rolls (opponent winning ties), he wins the game. Otherwise, he loses all his cards, stays on the Election track and starts collecting again.

RTE includes two mapsheets, 1008 counters, 5 PAC, a 32 pg rulebook, a 16 pg scenario book and 24 pg history booklet. RTE also has a very dramatic cover, with German jets (that look like USAF 104s) intercepting US Flying Wing bombers and an M48 Patton tank moving towards a dead Panther V while being attacked by German helicopter gunship missiles in Trafalgar Square below Big Ben. Good stuff!

Most of the comments in RS/BC are applicable here. The maps stretch from Casablanca to Afghanistan and a ways into the USSR. I didnt know that Iceland was north of England!! The maps for RTE and RS/BC do NOT mate up. They are close, but not match. In the history of RTE, Europe has been conquered by the Germans, and the USA is coming to save the day (again). Europe has been broken up into many minor provinces with Germanic sounding names and spellings, including many of their own combat units. Supply once again rules the day as many of RTEs charts and tables look to deal with the gaining and spending of supply points.

I cannot say for sure if RS/BC and RTE use the same game system, but since they are a Trilogy, I would assume they do.

Each represents a Person (widely defined to include the likes of Old Yeller and Daisy Duck, as well as groups, such as The Lost Boys), Place (Burbank or Main Street USA), or Thing (anything that doesn't fit in the other two categories, including concepts like Twitterpation).  There are 20 clues on each card, as well as a picture of one of four Disney characters: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, or Goofy.

The players take turns being the Reader, who will read one of the clues to a player.  If that player guesses the Person, Place or Thing on the card, they get it.  If not, the Reader reads the next clue to the next player, and so on.

The object of the game is to be the first to collect three cards with the same Disney character picture, or to collect three cards with all different pictures.  If you guess an answer with three or less clues given, you may randomly take a card from another player, add it to your hand, and then return a card of your choice to that player (which could be the card you just took).  This allows you to possibly better your hand.

Most of the cards are pretty easy for adults, but there are a few that are rather challenging.  With a little handicapping for the kids, this game could be played by the entire family.

There are no roads needed to place the settlements, but you have to pay for them by using resources collected from a die roll that corresponds to a number on the area. Because the grid is used, the players place settlements on the cross of 4 corners, and have access to all of the resources touching it. The main goal of the game is to build your settlements, advance them from branches to wards to stakes (settlement to city) so that you can collect more resources (1,2 or 3). Then along the way the final goal is to pay for certain cards with resources and money(gold resource). After all the cards have been collected by the players the one with the most of these special cards (3 different kinds) wins. Along the way there are special cards that allow for the robber (every player rolls on the end of their turn to see if they are robbed [on doubles of the dice]) to not influence you, the black crickets card to unaffect you via the seagulls card, missionary cards, divine inspiration cards, paying tithing bonuses, etc. The components need some help, being that it does look like a first production. Thicker cardboard than normal games might have. Instead of a deck of cards, they come in a sheet you have to pull apart. For a first try it wasn't bad, except the trench (folded area of board), which makes placement on that area annoying.

Beyond the Urals postulates that the Germans had defeated the Red Army in their 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, but failed to force the capitulation of the Soviet Union itself. In early 1941, Soviet leaders had decided to deploy their armed forces up front on the border with the Third Reich, as chief of the Red Army armored forces, General D.G. Pavlov, had proposed. As a result of this alternative deployment, the Germans destroy the Red Army on the frontiers, sweep eastwards, and take Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad in late 1941.

However, in this alternative time-line, the Soviets keep fighting even after the Germans reached their planned Archangel-Astrakhan stop line. Being given no alternatives other than to suffer the consequences of German exploitation and terror in the East, or to continue a desperate resistance, the Russians and other Soviet peoples go on fighting. The remnants of the Red Army make their stand to protect the great industrial complexes east of the Urals, hoping to draw in the Germans for the final decisive battle. As 1942 opens, Hitler orders the Wehrmacht to head into the East for the final battle of annihilation in Eurasia, beyond the Urals.

Each hex on the map represents approximately 20 miles (32.4 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are armies, while all German units are corps. Air power is represented abstractly, with two counters representing the effects of German tactical air superiority. Each full game turn represents one week.

Unusually, the board is split into squares rather than the more traditional hexes.  There are resource generating squares, mystical sites and castles.  Players must manage these resources an fight battles to become the king of all England.  The mystical sites contain guardians which must be fought in order to capture the holy grail.  Riddles must also be answered correctly.  Battles are dice and table driven affairs.

The boards are heavy and in keeping with the theme.  The counters are very thin and insubstantial.  There are two dice, 150 knight counters, 150 foot soldier counters, 150 standard counters, 84 gold coin counters, 9 magic tokens, 16 guardian cards, 47 cards of fortune, 36 riddle cards and 6 wipe clean record sheets.

The players travel round a board using dice, in the usual way, matching GRAPE cards they collect along the way to WINE cards that they have to purchase (52 wines labels, of which only 3 are available at any time(face up)). By obtaining a matching GRAPE and WINE label, and buying a LICENSE, the player can then produce that wine, which earns them money.

The object of the game is to establish monopolies - there are only 2 WINES for each region, and if the player can produce both, they own that region. Target for a short game (90 minutes) is 3 monopolies, while a normal game (2-3 hours) is 6 monopolies.

This is not a simple roll and move game, as there is a certain amount of economics in the game - the value of everybody's wine is dependent on the VINTAGE, which changes periodically.

There is no need to have a knowledge of wine, as the information on what grape makes what wine is provided on the cards. So unlike The Wine Game, which tests your knowledge of wine, Connoisseur actually teaches you about it.

The game is well produced, with a nice board, printed in colour, and very nicely finished cards and playing pieces.

14985,Batalla del Metauro,1963,5.5,2,1,2,2,45,45,,Ancient Miniatures ,Area MovementDice Rolling,"This game is an early Spanish attempt of a wargame, based on the battle at the Metauro 207 BC, where Hasdrubal lost against  Gaius Claudius Nero. The game comes with a booklet about the historical battle, and an album with glue-in images from the film Hannibal (Edgar G. Ulmer, 1959).
It has very simple rules: the units can move one to three spaces and battles are resolved by simple dice rolls, modified by strength of the units (elephant!, cavalry) and area bonus. Units have something like a zone of control.
The aim is to kill the opponent's leader or to capture the opponents flag-space.
What makes this game really interesting are the beautiful hand-painted miniatures. In the original version by Rojas y Malaret, the figures were made of plastic and hand painted. In the German version everything is the same (rules, board, box), but the figures are made of Elastolin, a material invented by the Hausser company a few years earlier and used for toys (they are also hand-painted). Hausser used its own miniatures (diferent and a bit smaller (=4 cm) than the Spanish ones), but the elephant comes from the Rojas y Malaret game Carthago (Hausser had no elephant in its catalogue). That's why the elephant miniature in the Hausser version is a bit different in scale and material from the other units (and equal to the original Spanish one).
The Rojas y Malaret version was published in Spain in 1961, and the German version by Hausser in 1963 but it was republished for years.

It's Christmas Eve. The little town of Elfenbein is covered with snow. To help Santa find his way in the snow, the people of the town have dug out 'streets' and crooked 'paths' between their houses. Now they are all waiting patiently in their homes for Santa's presents, roasting chestnuts on an open fire to kill the time. All people, except some naughty kids. They have discovered a new game: Santa watching! Santa enjoys the game too as he is the only one who has discovered the crooked paths. And when everything else fails to escape the kids he can always use some magic...

Han Heidema gave out specially designed games as Christmas cards; one for every year from 1990 to 1999. This was card #9 and was sent out in 1998. It features artwork by Doris Matthus.

One player is Santa and the other 2-3 players are the naughty kids. Each player is given the cards of one suit from a normal deck of cards. A round consists of each player simultaneously choosing a card to play. Whoever plays the highest card selects the order of play for the round. Each player's card will also determine how far that player can move. Santa scores points for dropping off presents at houses without being seen. The naughty kids each score points for seeing Santa and collecting the presents he's delivering. The game lasts 13 rounds (the number of cards each player has).

Mik Svellov's website states Han Heidema was given credit as a gesture by Alan Moon.

But the answer isnt what the parents want, its what the kids want, because in this game  Kids Rule! The game questions were written by parents, and the answers were selected entirely by 8-14 year old children at the San Francisco School in San Francisco, CA. Everyone will have fun trying to guess how kids would behave if they were in charge. Its a great way for parents and children to bond, understand one another, and discuss the myriad of issues that they will both face as the youngsters grow from kids to adults.

15006,Advice,1976,5.5,8,2,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Point to Point MovementRock-Paper-Scissors,"Advice is a sort of checkers variant; each player has four types of piece: priests, lawyers, psychiatrists, and a single citizen whom the rest of the pieces try to shepherd to it's goal across the board. Pieces can move a single space or jump any other pieces any number of times. If a piece jumps a subordinate piece of the opponent, it is captured and removed from play. Priests beat lawyers, lawyers beat psychiatrists, and psychiatrists beat priests. Any piece can capture the citizen. The board is a 9x9 grid of squares; each player starts from a home corner and moves towards the opposite (opponents) corner. On every move, a piece must end up farther forward than it began.

Created by a psychiatrist, the pieces are modeled according to WH Sheldons somatotypes - priests are round, comfortable, and cuddly, lawyers square and forceful, psychiatrists triangular, lean and edgy.

In a game, each player plays each role once, and the player who eliminated the defense in the fewest moves wins the game.

The board is composed of rectangular spaces arranged like bricks in a wall, making it effectively hexagonal. There are blocked spaces where no one can move, and three sets of differently colored closable spaces - when an offensive piece is on a colored square, similarly colored squares are off limits to the defense. There are also squares numbered 1 - 3; when a defensive piece lands on one of these, the number is added to the offensive player's move total.

15008,King Kangaroo,1948,8,2,0,2,6,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Point to Point Movement,"Not quite Chinese Checkers:

It may interest readers to know that this game originated when the Inventor was faced with entertaining the Allied Forces during the last war so that they could, at least for an hour or two, be drawn away from thoughts of their normal surroundings. Having in a measure achieved his objective he set himself the task of making the game public, for the first time, in early December 1948, when King Kangaroo appeared for sale in the leading London Departmental Stores, such as Selfridges, Hamleys, Army  Navy Stores, DH Evans, Bentalls, etc.
King Kangaroo is therefore an entirely NEW GAME of which the Inventor holds the Patent and manufacturing rights as also the Copyrights of the rules for the United Kingdom and World Patents are pending.

The differences from the standard game are that the pieces cannot move at all without jumping, and can jump any number of adjacent pieces. There is also a single King Kangaroo piece per player, which functions slightly differently.

[Edit by Derek Carve:  Not brazen as [originally] implied above [point taken].  It is certainly played on a Chinese Checkers board but, come to that, many totally original games are played on a draughts board (Lines of Action is a good example) without being a re-packaging of draughts.   In this truly excellent game, as correctly explained, the pieces move totally differently from Chinese Checkers BUT one piece on each side - the King - has to be different from the rest in some way.  This is why it cannot be played with a standard set of Chinese Checkers unless, of course, one is prepared to paint some of the pieces.]

It is 3046. Players build up two Mad-Max-type small naval fleets and fight it out.

Each player starts with a fleet of seven ships: one flagship, one battleship, one frigate, two battlecruisers, and two escorts. The five ship types each have specific speeds, armor, weapons, maneuverability and staff morale.

At the beginning of the game, players spend money to improve fleet equipment and staff. A pilot commands each ship and each pilot is given points to  split between Tactics and Leadership attributes. These characteristics are used to modify dice rolls during combat. A more skillful Admiral commands the flagship.

Each turn is played in one real-time minute. Ship speeds correspond to the physical number of centimeters a ship can move on the table during a turn. Combat is resolved after every ship movement. Depending on ship positions, players can shoot projectiles, ram or board other ships. The success of an attack and the degree of damage are determined by modified dice rolls. Ships sink if their armor score falls below 0 and players overtake ships if there is no more staff on board.

The game ends when one Admiral is captured or dies.

15044,Inchon,1981,5.82143,7,3,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Korean War Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterSimulation,"Inchon depicts the Korean War's most famous battle, the U.S. and South Korean amphibious landings that led to the liberation of Seoul and, coupled with the defeat of the last North Korean assault on the Pusan Perimeter, turned the tide of the war (until, that is, Communist China intervened in force). The map scale is 1.7 kilometers per hex. The game lasts 12 turns that evidently equate to days. Units are companies and armored platoons for the U.S./ROK, mostly battalions for North Korea (whose army the rulebook consistently calls by its Korean name, In Min Gun or IMG). Higher level headquarters units implement the game's (rather restrictive and cumbersome) command rules.

The components are typical of Simulations Canada: an unattractive but functional four-color map, simple counters and a small, tightly printed rulebook. U.S. Marine and Army counters are shades of green, South Korean shades of red, North Korean a uniform brown. Counters are one-sided, with the back giving setup or arrival information for the historical scenarios.

The U.S./ROK side earns victory points by seizing objectives in and around Seoul, the enemy by inflicting casualties. As alternatives to the historical setup and reinforcement schedules, the U.S./ROK may use a free setup, or the IMG may receive more rapid reinforcements.

Game turns are divided into impulses, a concept borrowed from White Death, a Frank Chadwick design. In each of its impulses, a side may use all or some of its 9 movement points (but always at least one). The impulses alternate until all movement points are exhausted or neither player wants to do anything further that turn. The system is attractive in principle but may bog down in practice. It also requires record keeping, as air, naval and artillery units may bombard only once per turn rather than once per impulse.

Although all units have the same 9 movement points, how far they in fact can go differs by type - tracked vehicle, foot, support (wheeled vehicle) or irregular - and by morale class. If, for instance, a player divides his turn into three impulses, an A class armored platoon can potentially move 45 hexes along a road, while C class infantry company could advance 9 at most. Higher class units are also less likely to break in combat and can operate effectively at a greater distance from their HQ's. Out-of-supply units are slowed down. Those suppressed by bombardment may not move at all.

According to the designer's notes, In the historic scenario most play-tests ended with the UN player getting most of his objectives, though about half the time he was not able to secure the Seoul capital hex in time. As a result the game usually turned on how high a casualty level was sustained to get these objectives. . . . In the various Free UN landing and Rapid IMG reinforcement scenarios playtests indicated just about anything could happen.

15058,Go Forward Rugby,2004,6.66667,3,2,2,2,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Memory Sports ,Area MovementCampaign / Battle Card DrivenDice RollingMemory,"Go Forward Rugby uses a rack and card system.  The rack slides up and down the field  Board to show where play currently is.  If the rack moves past the Try Line at either end of the field a Try (Touch down)  is scored.  Players hold cards in their hands which they use to influence play in the rack.  The Cards represent players on the field and special actions that they may do.  The idea of the rack is that your opponent can see where you cards are, just not exactly which players they are.  This means the game has a memory component to it.  The game tries to focus on Rugby's ideas and leaves out many of the finer points in an effort to keep the game simple. The Game is currently free to download from the web as 4 small pdf files which include cut out plans to build the card rack.

15059,Skogskarlarnas orienteringspel,1945,6,1,2,2,4,0,0,,Sports ,Dice Rolling,"This is an old Swedish game seeking to simulate the beautiful and sometimes harsh sport of orienteering. It's not a very accurate simulation (or rather it's quite crappy orienteering). To win the game you must visit a number of checkpoints (in a specified order) and get to the goal before the other players. The game board is basically an ordinary orienteering map with an overlayed grid.

To move, you roll three dice. One is an ordinary D6 that tells how far you can run this turn and the other two gives the directions that you can choose from. The direction dice both have three blank sides and the other three sides have directions N, S, NS and E, W, EW respectively. If you are running along a road or river or other distinct feature of the landscape you ignore the direction dice. If not, you have to combine and choose one direction from the direction dice (if both dice are blank you can run any way you like, not necessarily only in one direction).

This game was published during the 1940s.

15070,Slaughterloo,1998,7.22222,9,3.25,2,6,0,0,,Fantasy Miniatures Wargame ,Card DraftingDice RollingVariable Phase Order,"Slaughterloo is the game of massed armies involving the world of Valon, the fantasy world of Flintloque.  The game includes two volumes, the Rulebook and the Army Lists, as well as character figures for the Orc/British leader and the Elf/French leader, as well as dice and command cards needed for play.

You will need to put together your armies from the fantasy Napoleonic line produced by Alternative Armies for this and Flintloque/Deadloque.  While I bought it to play the game, I found it was very handy for Flintloque players as it contains a much more complete background on the world of Valon, as well as details on the uniforms of the different armies and races of the fantasy world.  Lots of photographs in color and black  white give the player lots of details to help paint their units.  There is also a sample game with color photographs showing each phase and turn of a game to demonstrate the rules in action over a period of three turns.  The game recommends minimum units of divisions, made up of an average of 3 infantry units (around 20 figures each), one cavalry unit (of around 10 figures) and one artillery unit (one or two guns with crews, limbers, etc.), but suggests that each player can control a corps of 2 divisions.  I believe that you could play to learn the rules with just 2 or 3 units as you build your armies.  There is some player-to-player and distributer-to-player support available on an associated Yahoo group.

Description is based on the 2nd edition.

15103,bolo' bolo: Eine Welt ohne Geld,1986,2.25,4,0,3,6,60,60,,Industry / Manufacturing Novel-based Political ,Set CollectionTrading,"From the back of the box, roughly translated:

At last a game with a future we can pursue: a new world with new qualities. A world without daily work routines, traffic jams, bureaucracy, deforestation, and hunger problems. A world with more exchanges, more experiences, and more human interaction. Better improvements can not be hoped for: more money and more consumption, yet more renunciation. Improvements today which are more friendly to life will produce more cultural riches, and more exchanges between all. This is all with a minimal burden on the environment and a maximum amount of self-determination. Put an end to the monopoly!

You choose a new homeland, a new Bolo. Every Bolo has a special way of life and is nearby. The organization of your chosen community needs you to bring it goods. You obtain distinct items during the course of the game. Any surplus produced in your own Bolo is trade able with other players. Every exchange offers a new experience. Also, every visit to another Bolo brings new knowledge.

Which Bolo should be judged to be first? Last can quickly become first, as when someone has attained a new innovation, it can quickly be shared with the rest of the collective through visits and the cultural exchanges that result!

---

bolo' bolo is game designer / Anarchist P.M.'s second foray into political board games, with his first being the cult tile laying favourite Demono. bolo' bolo is based upon the book of the same name which lays out P.M.'s ideal society based upon sub-communities, each autonomous, with an economy fueled by trade.

Game components are in both German and French, and are rather archaic with the 'cards' being coloured paper with black ink style drawings, absolutely nothing like Demono's more lush visuals.

The basic idea of the title is that each player represents one of the bolos on the board, each of which specialises in the production of certain things, and which needs certain others, which is accomplished via trade.

The game also included a number of specialized plastic components: figures which swung their kicking legs to kick the ball over the plastic goal posts; a plastic wedge to loft the ball; and a large rugby-ball shaped randomizing devise into which the smaller ball was dropped to decide scrums.

Examples:  Jack-high hand, a pair of sevens, four queens.  There are no straights, flushes, or full houses, only a specified card and the number of copies of that card in the hand.  Each player is dealt the same number of cards (1 - 7).  Players then bid on the combined hands of all players.  A player that bids seven kings is betting that there will be seven or more kings total in everyone's hands.  To bid, each player must bid either a higher number of matching cards, or the same number of a higher ranked cards.  (So, to overbid seven kings, bid seven aces, or eight or more of anything.)  When players think someone has bid more than the cards will support, they call liar.  Once everyone around the table has called liar rather than keep bidding, the cards are shown.  If someone is called a liar, but the cards prove him right, he wins the pot of chips accumulated during the bidding.  If he loses, the chips remain in the pot for the next hand.

The game takes place in the jungle, a square containing 36 tree cards. Each player controls two elephants of his color.

Every turn, the top card is revealed. The action described upon it will then be accomplished successively by all players. The 4 different actions are:
- take off a tree from the jungle
- move a tree
- move an elephant to a nearby tree
- make an elephant jump over the nearby tree

Once all action cards have been revealed, they are shuffled again to create a new pile.

With the trees disappearing, it becomes harder and harder for the elephants to stay in the jungle. Indeed the movements are compulsory.
If an elephant cannot complete the action, he falls from his tree (only one elephant per tree, heavy enough!) and is removed from the game.
The game stops when only one player has elephants left in the game and he is declared winner.

If another cowboy is able to catch up with the posse bringing an item to the Holdup Scene, that cowboy may join up and share in the reward.

If the game sounds familiar, there is a reason. Milton Bradley essentially repackaged its Hopalong Cassidy game for this venture. The Tales of Wells Fargo Game uses the same 8 metal horses, 12 discs (albeit with lower reward values), and even the same custom spinner.

15147,Zoo Food,1999,5.35714,7,1,1,5,10,10,Children's,Animals Children's Game Educational ,Chit-Pull SystemSet Collection,"Zoo Food is a simple childrens' game. Ten animal cards are placed on the table. Each animal likes to eat three kinds of food. Thirty food tokens are placed in a bag.

The game includes 10 animal cards, each showing the three types of food the animal likes to eat. Under the picture of the animal is an empty circle. A set of food chits, each 1/3 of a circle, are placed in a bag. Players each take a few animal cards (based on the number of players) and on turn draw a food chit blindly from the bag. If it matches one of their animals, they can keep it and place it in the circle. When the animal has all three foods, a complete circle is made. The winner is the player who has the most animals at the end of the game.

Early versions of this game showed pictures of the 10 animals on the cards; later versions made this into a puzzle as well as the animals are wooden pieces that fit into the cards.

15148,Steam and Steel,1998,6.375,8,3.5,3,4,180,180,Wargames,Economic Nautical Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterTrading,"Quoting from the review at http://flyhi.de/games/dampfundstahl1.html:

Steam and Steel is a game of naval power and economy; the objective is to gain the commercial and military superiority on the oceans. The crucial areas, or rather points, of the map are the ports, and the units at the player's disposal are his warships. The winner is the player that controls the largest port capacity at the end of the game, i.e. after a certain number of game turns or a predetermined time.

Players gain income from their ports. They spend their income for increasing port capacity, fortifying ports, building shipyards, and building ships. Ships have no inherent value towards the objective of the game, but they are necessary to protect the bases. New technology makes older ships obsolete, forcing players to constantly upgrade their fleets.

When opposing ships or fleets meet, or ships enter a fortified port, game play switches to short interludes of tactical battle.

15152,Mind Duel,1986,3.33333,3,1,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Fighting ,,"Mind Duel - Psionic Combat for Two players

In issue #4 of the magazine VIP of Gaming.

Mind Duel is a game of psychic combat between two trained telepaths. You attack your opponent's mind and defend your own, with focused bits of psionic energy...By invading your opponent's mind, you may stun your enemy, or pinch a pressure point and cause the loss of those focused bits of psi-power. Your object is to occupy the opponent's conscious mind, whereupon the enemy will black out, never to awaken again.

Game consists of the rules, gameboard and cut-apart counters found in the magazine and 2D6.

The gameboard  represents the telepaths' minds and the area of mental struggle between them. Each mind is divided into conscious, subconscious and unconscious levels (the mental arcs). The area between the battling minds is divided into a series of wavelength arcs.

Basic Play: 1-Announce your attacking pieces (pieces that will move). 2-Pieces not moving then decay (fall back due to lack of support). 3-Move the attacking pieces. 4-Shift if you choose and are able. 5-Apply any attack results. Sending a piece into your opponent's mind is an attack. Attacking the Unconscious stuns the opponent for one turn. Attacking the Subconscious permanently eliminates your opponent's furthest advanced piece. Attacking the Conscious defeats the opponent and wins the game.

Each turn, a player chooses between drawing a card from the pile of cards not yet drawn, or giving a card to the player next in turn. Cards drawn are placed in front of the player, without looking on the back side. A player that is given a card by the previous player has to draw a card, they can't give one away.

Most cards have a score on the front face (visible to the person in turn), while a few others are scrying cards. The scrying cards allow the player to turn one card over to read the prophecy there. The card is then left with the back up, and this gives that card a new score. The prophecy text is about characters in the comic, and has nothing to do with the game play.

Only one card can be turned for a player at one time, so if you get the option to turn another one over, you must first decide if you want to flip the reversed card you may have back, before turning over a new one.

The player with the highest score when the deck runs out wins.

15198,Armatac II,1980,3,1,0,2,8,0,0,Wargames,Miniatures Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-CounterSimulation,"From the inside cover page of the books:

The ARMATAC II system is a component system which allows the player to purchase books and playing pieces as they are needed, to recreate the battles and campaigns of World War II. The players create armies of different sizes and nationalities and must use all of the skill and knowledge of strategy they possess to defeat their opponents. Rules are provided on how to play the games, but these can be looked upon as guidelines. It will constantly be stressed that this is your system and the rules can be altered to suit your particular style of play. The games can be played as simple or complicated as you prefer. Because of the endless variety of combat situations which can be constructed, we hope players will never tire of the system.

We offer 5 books within the system, each one covering 300 weapons. There are 2 aircraft books, 2 naval books and 1 armor book. This means a total of 1,500 weapons are covered. A total of over 1,000,000 of these weapons were produced and we provide production figures for all of them. Our playing pieces are larger than those offered by other gaming companies and are presented in a variety of shapes which look like the weapons they have been chosen to represent. Our playing pieces are available in four different 4 color camouflage patterns. A national insignia sheet is also available in full color and contains over 500 insignias from over a dozen countries. When applied to the playing pieces, these insignias combined with the size, shape and camouflage patterns provide an air of realism and excitement never before attainable at the price they are offered.

Because of the larger size of our playing pieces, it stands to reason our hexes must be larger to accommodate them. In keeping with our policy of non-restriction, a stencil is available within our system which allows the player to trace this hex pattern across any playing surface they choose. A readily available and inexpensive playing surface is poster board (22 x 28). Two of these boards butted together make a good beginner size and three boards make a good overall size for any type of gaming activity. These boards can be left plain, or full color scenarios can be drawn on them prior to tracing the hex pattern. Even those players with limited artistic ability can create personalized scenarios with a little time and patience. Maps can be purchased of oceans, continents and individual countries. These maps are relatively inexpensive, are good size for gaming and make for an extremely attractive playing surface. County survey maps can also be acquired, as well as city and county street indexes for those who wish to engage in street fighting. A hex pattern sheet is also provided with our stencil which can be inexpensively reprinted at your local quickie printer.

A map or scenario can also be applied to a window shade and our design traced across it. The shade can be stretched across the playing area and retained at the ends while in use. For those with a permanent playing table, shade brackets can be attached to one edge of the table and the shade snapped in. The pull tab can be retained at the opposite edge with the aid of a nail. In this way the shade will rest squarely on the table top and remain taut. A variety of shades can be prepared and used as they are needed. This should be especially appealing for clubs. Games can also be played on non-hex surfaces by simply substituting inches for hex speed, which is contained in the WARGAME CHARTS. Remember, we will recommend how the games should be played, but the final decision is up to you.

You would think that the C  C-Ancients people would've have collaborated with these MINIS makers, to produce a much more appealing approach for THAT, and it's not like WE can't combine those for ourselves.

From the back of the box:
The military historical game Battles of Alexander the Great is based on the events of the Hellenic campaign to the East. In the spring of 334 BC the united Hellenic army invaded the Persian kingdom. Battles followed one after another. Battles of different peoples tried to resist the conquerors: Persian bowmen, Scythian cavalry, Indian elephants. The game has five scenarios of the most important battles.

Two to six players can participate in the game. The combat characteristics of the armies are close to historic. Tactical maneuvering by regiments is of great significance in the game. A skillful commander can bring an army to a victory over an out numbering enemy. The kit contains six scenarios, each of them making you able to reproduce a historic battle or try to change it. In any case one needs to win not only by number, but also by skill.

The opposing forces manoeuvre on a map of the terrain divided into 13.5 mile squares.  The Zulu forces comprise impi (army) units represented on the map by named counters and comprising a variable number of ibutho (regimental) units.  These latter, varying in strength from fifty to ten strength points, are kept concealed off-map in holding boxes corresponding to the various impis, until encountered by  a British force.  The British  commander is therefore somewhat uncertain as to what faces him.  British forces manoeuvre as six columns (seven according an erratum) plus the static garrison at Rorkes Drift .

Battles are resolved on a separate battle-board. The British always adopt a defensive posture, either in the open or behind field fortifications.  The Zulus are always the attacking force!  Losses are taken in strength points marked off the players charts.

The game continues until either player reaches a loss-limit or the British occupy Ulundi for two successive Zulu combat phases.  Victory points are then awarded on the basis of the losses inflicted  and by control of the squares containing the Zulu capital of Ulundi, Rorkes Drift and Middle Drift.

Counters were printed on a section of the mapsheet.  
Die-cut, mounted counters were included as a bonus with Far Seas, Strategy  Tactics magazine #125.

Kiev: The Battle of Encirclement, 1941, depicts the German Blitzkrieg campaign that lasted from 29 August to 26 September 1941.  It ended with one of the largest encirclements in history, Nearly the entire Southwestern Front of the Red Army was encircled, with the Soviets losing over 600,000 troops, 3700 guns and almost 900 tanks.

Rostov: The First Soviet Counterattack, 1941, depicts the German drive across the Donets Basin in the fall of 1941. Army Group South attempted to seize the valuable communications junction at Rostov and establish bridgeheads across both the Donets and lower Don Rivers.  In the ensuing fighting around Rostov, the Germans suffered their first strategic setback in their campaign against the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Army drove the German mechanized spearhead from this vital area.

Players roll and move around the board collecting food items from the draw pile or other players. When a player lands on a lets go to McDonalds space, s/he draws a menu card and reads the order aloud. The other players have to fill the order as quickly as possible with the food items from their trays and toss colored marbles into the McDonalds sign chute when they believe they are complete and correct. The winning player (the one with the first marble in) then verifies that the order is filled correctly and if it is then s/he collects points for it, and if not then the next player finished verifies his or her order for the points, and so on. The player reading the order collects the food ordered  if the order cannot be filled correctly with any players available items, the order in cancelled and roll and move play continues. Players score 1 point per food item served, or excess (any more than three) food item from their own tray returned to the draw pile before they roll to move for their turn - but they do not score any if they forget and roll first, but they still have to return excess items. First player to 25 points wins the game.

15215,Alaska Pipeline: The Energy Crisis Game,1973,0,0,0,4,6,60,60,,Card Game Economic Educational ,Card DraftingHand ManagementTrick-taking,"From the game box:

This game involves a little old lady and her attempt to prevent the pipeline from being built. During her campaign, the public goes through an energy crisis and the oil companies leave Alaska. Another character in the game is called the little professor, and its his job to answer all of the objections to the pipeline. The objective of this game is to refute the attacks on the pipeline then get the permit to build it.
Played with cards on a board, which contains the map of Alaska, the scoring spaces are gas-ration coupons. Use the least amount of gas-ration coupons and win the game.
Pipeline comes ready to play. It includes a game board, game pieces (6 pawns), rule sheet and 52 playing cards.

additional from the 1990s reissue box:

The first game based on the energy crisis came out in 1973. Called Alaska Pipeline referring, of course, to the source of oil we were hoping to receive from Alaska. The Trans-Alaskan Pipeline was completed in 1977 and we have been utilizing the oil since then.
Now, nearly three decades later we are faced with yet another energy crisis and its time to play the game again.

--

The games underlying purpose is (was) to educate and create support for the Alaska Pipeline to be built, and it does it by placing facts, opinions, events, and objections about The Pipeline onto playing cards  the game, in mechanics reality, is actually really just a Hearts card game variant, and the boards 100 gas-ration coupon spaces simply represent the scoring total.

4 suits of cards (Oil Company, Objection, Fact, and Public  13 of each) represent the four suits. Players gain/use gas-ration points by getting stuck with the Objection cards during trick taking (which are 1 point each, like the hearts suit in Hearts), or the Oil Company Pipeline Permit card (which counts as 13, like the queen of spades in Hearts). Players move their pawns up the board the number of points acquired after each round. Though, if one player can take them all (the 13 Objection and the Pipeline Permit card) they can either advance the other players 26 points, or deduct 26 from their own total and move back on the board. This game also includes the Native Land Claims Fact card allowing the trick taker to deduct 10 points (i.e. like the jack of diamonds variant in Hearts). After the first player reaches 100 gas-ration coupon points, they lose and the game is over and the player with the lowest gas-ration points wins. There are also rules for 3, 5 and 6 player games.

15217,Fire Alarm,1938,0,0,0,2,4,30,30,,Racing ,Roll / Spin and Move,"In this game players take on the roll of firefighters. The board depicts streets and house locations (4 small houses and 1 large central public building). Wooden blocks are stacked on the structure locations to depict the buildings. Each building has a number: 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, and the large building is both 1-1 and 6-6.

On a turn you roll the dice, and if you throw doubles, you remove the roof of the building with the matching number to expose the red surface underneath indicating a fire. You may then move your trucks the number indicated - either 1 truck the total amount thrown, or both trucks each using a number from one of the dice. You must throw doubles before you can move (thus starting a fire), but after that you can move regardless of what you roll. Each time a double of a house already on fire is rolled, a block from that building is removed.

To put out a fire, both spaces in front of a building must be occupied by a fire engine. Each truck then scores points equal to the remaining number of blocks for that building. If you own both fire engines, the second truck scores double points as a bonus. The large central building is also worth double points (or quadruple points if both fire engines are yours). The player with the highest score after ALL buildings have caught fire and been put out wins the game.

15231,Minden Playing Card Cricket,1979,6.94,15,2.6667,1,22,90,90,,Card Game Sports ,Dice RollingHand Management,"Minden Playing Card Cricket has been around since the early 1980s and is one of the best of the stats-based cricket games. Each turn of the game simulates an over of Test or One Day Cricket. Turns are resolved by using a regular deck of playing cards instead of rolling dice, although six sided dice are used to resolve some plays. The device of replicating a single over per turn is perfect, as full test matches can be played over several hours, while one day games can be played out in a single session. The system ingeniously allows for hat tricks, batting collapses, batsmen playing themselves in, and batsman playing with confidence. There are two forms of the game. Basic, which only include some rules and in which players are not individually carded (although they do have individual stats) and the Advanced Game, in which each player has a unique card.

It produces a very convincing range of scores and excitement (perhaps rather more than the real game does). Extremely clever.

The 5th Edition of this game is now available from mindencricket.com

Rebel Seas is the first of three books spanning the years 1774-1792. The other volumes will treat the struggle for India (Monsoon Seas: Suffren's Campaign for India) and England's blockades of its Continental foes (European Seas: The Lifeline of Empires).

With the sugar cube, the players determine for themselves over how many hurdles their horse should jump. However, the horse will only be able to make the jump if the colour of the hurdle and the dice don't coincide. If the horse fails a jump it has to return to the referee who makes sure that everybody complies with the rules and is always waiting next to the starting square of the round that is being played.

One player controls a scavenger ship trying to loot sunken gold, while the other player controls a naval ship trying to sink the scavenger. Using a spinner, the scavenger player moves across the board trying to land on gold dot spaces (where a different spinner is used to see whether a gold coin is found). The naval player tries to line up next to the scavenger and fire upon it (where the second spinner is used to determine hits). The scavenger player wins by collecting 7 gold coins without getting sunk. The naval player wins by scoring 7 hits on the scavenger ship and sinking it.

All firing must be done in a straight line (i.e. you can't shoot diagonally). If spinner B points to a number that is greater than the number of spaces between you and your opponent, you score a hit. Each tank has 7 hit points. Blow up your opponents tank to win the game.

When all bandits have been captured, the player with the most reward money wins.

15291,Fantoccini,1969,0,0,0,6,16,0,0,,Party Game ,Acting,"Fantoccini - The Game of Living Theater

Fantoccini is an adult party game for three to eight couples. In addition to providing mature entertainment, Fantoccini has value in the learning process for college and theater drama groups, and in institutions where the acting-out of conflicts or 'play acting' is a desired form of therapy.

Game consists of: Gameboard with the scene area in the center, the revision wing at the left, and the score sheet on the right; 150 scene cards with green, blue, or yellow backing which color-correspond to columns on the board's scene area; 180 player cards player cards with red backing which color-correspond to the red columns on the board's scene area; 36 square revision cards; two Grand Thespian Certificates; and 16 Fantoccini invitation tickets, each admitting a couple to your party. These properties will allow for two complete Fantoccini parties.

The object of Fantoccini is to become Grand Thespian...the first player who has filled all 12 squares on the scoresheet by acting 6 times, having Authored twice, having been Wardrobe Lady twice, and having been Critic-Censor twice.

Players write their names on the blank side of 6 red cards. The revision cards are dealt equally to all players. Each color-coded deck is shuffled separately and placed face down. Place scene and player cards face down on the first free row of the scene area in the proper colors (green, red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, yellow).

Reveal the scene by turning over the cards on the row, announcing the scene as it unfolds. The green card establishes where the scene is played. The red and blue cards define the actor and their role (duplicate red cards are replaced with another red card so that there are 3 different actors). The green card establishes the players' motivation. For example, In a bomb shelter, Bob (a prim spinster of 30), Marge (a raspy throated dice player) and Hank (a politician) are saving a life. The three actors go into another room and prepare the scene (should run 2 - 3 minutes).

Players bid for Author (may reassign roles or replace a scene card), Wardrobe Lady (provides costume items) and Censor-Critic (an arbiter of whether or not the scene will be played and judge of the scene's quality based on audience response and the critic's opinion).

The scene is played (or not, based on the Critic), evaluated and participation tallied. Lay out a new scene face down on the next free row and continue with new scenes until a player tallies all 12 squares on the wipe-off score area and is declared the Grand Thespian.

The board is a slotted raised platform that sits in the box. The 24 Fluppy Dog cards each depict 2 dogs (an upper and a lower) of various colors. These cards are inserted into the board slots to hide the lower dogs. On your first turn you draw a card and keep it to start your chain. From then on when you draw a card, if the color of the lower (hidden) dog matches a color at either end of your chain, you connect it (ala dominoes). If the color does not match, you place it back in a board slot. Thus you need to remember where hidden Fluppy Dogs are put back so you can find the ones you need to make a color-match. The first player to collect 5 cards in his or her chain is the winner.

Chapman, an army pilot, is based on actual blind flying conditions. When flying the beam, the pilot hears a steady radio buzz when he is on his true course. If he flies to one side of the beam, he hears the Morse code letter A (.-); if to the other, the letter N (-.). As he nears the On Course signal, the letters A and N will superimpose on the On Course buzz in what's called the Twilight zones. Finally, as the pilot approaches the radio sending station adjacent to the airport, the signal fades out into what's called the Cone of Silence.

The object of the game is to land safely at the airport. Each player places his marker on the Leg of the beam nearest them. The start space tells you which lane (A, N, or center) your plane begins its approach on. On your turn, you spin the spinner and move your plane the number of spaces indicated towards the Cone of Silence in the center of the board. You must follow the directions for any space you land on (usually these cause you to shift lanes). When the Cone of Silence is reached, you spin for a runway number to land on. The first player to land by exact count on their assigned runway space wins.

In the advanced game, players use the reverse sides of their boards. Each board depicts a different land at Disney World. Play is the same for the basic game, but you must match the pictures on the tokens to the corresponding Disney ride depicted on your 6 board spaces.

There are 10 different kinds of fruit (30 cards - 3 of each type) with a guard for each. The guard with the 3 cards it protects forms a set. The cards are distributed equally amongst the players. On a turn, you may ask any player for a fruit provided that you yourself hold either a fruit or the guard from that set. If the player has the fruit asked for, he must give it up, unless he has the guard of that fruit; for example, if one player asks another for an apple which he has, if he also holds the dog, he may refuse, saying, My apples are guarded by my dog.

You continue calling for fruit until you call on a person who either doesn't have any or has the guard for that set. Once stopped, all players draw 2 cards from the player to their left. Guards cannot be called away, but since they are frequently passed, their location is often doubtful. When you collect all 4 cards in a set, you lay them down in front of you. The player with the most sets at the end is the winner.

On each card are four pictures of pet shop animals (goldfish, puppy, turtle, etc.).  A set of smaller cards is turned over one at a time.  On these smaller cards are two animals, sometimes one or both will have a red X over it.  To win, players try to get rid of all their cards by matching them to the requirements on the small cards.  So, if a small card shows turtle not-kitten, any card a player has with a turtle but no kitten on it can be discarded.

The game is attractive and the play is quick.  It has a minor educational value, teaching pattern recognition and very, very light analysis.  Winning is entirely a random prospect.

The game will play well with very young players.  Optimally, I think Ages3 - 5
 is the right age for it, though the game box says Ages 4 and up
.

The game includes 35 big cards, 28 small cards, a tray, and rules. The storage box is conveniently small (no over packaging).

Included in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Volume 2 comic book collection, it is probably better as a joke than as a game.

The invasion of the Southern Sakhalin and the Kuriles by the Soviet Union. This was done in conjunction with the invasion of Japanese held Manchuria and Korea in the wake of the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Soviets surprisingly had a hard time in taking the Sakhalins and the Kuriles even though they outnumbered the defenders and had overwhelming advantage in firepower, the Japanese defenders fought fanatically and there were still pockets of Japanese resistance at the time of the armistice.

Sakhalin 1945 consists of 86 pieces, a 29.5 x 42 cm map (printed in English) and 10 pages of rules (in Japanese). The map covers from the Japanese/Soviet border at the 50th Parallel through the strategic town of Koton. Turn length is twelve hours and units are a platoon, companies or battalions. Player numbers are one or two and playing time is two hours.

Each player also receives 10 chips to use as money.

The dealer draws the top 4 cards from the blue deck and they are paired up their duplicates from the player's red cards and removed from the game. Then a trading round commences in which players may buy or sell their red cards at whatever price in chips they can agree to. After 3 minutes, the trading round ends and another 4 blue cards are drawn, paired, and removed from the game, followed by another round of trading and so on.

When only 1 red card is left, it is paired with the Boom card and a scoring round begins. The player in possession of the Boom card scores 25 points. In addition, all players score 1 point for each chip they have in excess of their starting 10. The cards are then dealt again for a new hand. The game is won by the first player scoring 75 points.

As in real football the object is to advance the ball over the opponents goal line for a score. Dice rolls are used for all aspects of the game. The kickoff, for example, travels a distance equal to 5 times the throw of the dice. The receiving player then rolls the dice for the return; if it's an even number, the ball is brought back the number of yards rolled, but if it's an odd number no gain is made. The offense may choose either a Line Plunge, an End Run, a Forward Pass, or a Trick Play. The greater a play's potential for gain, the greater risk of no gain or a loss of yards. A roll of doubles results in either a penalty or a turnover. When the time limit agreed upon by the players (before the game) is reached, the player who has the highest total score is the winner.

15379,Life is Ruff,1979,8,1,0,2,6,0,0,,Economic ,Roll / Spin and MoveStock HoldingTrading,"From the instructions:

Concept:

Life is a cycle of paychecks, bills and taxes that make it seem almost impossible to 'get ahead.'  It has even been said that there are only two certainties in life...death and taxes.  Today, of course, there is a third certainty...INFLATION!!

LIFE IS RUFF is about the cycle of income vs. outgo.  As in reality, the proper investments can help you beat inflation and ride the waves of a fluctuating economy.  In somewhat simplified terms, LIFE IS RUFF offers the player the same investment opportunities he has in real life and gives each player the opportunity to make investment decisions.  But any opportunity not taken may be lost, for inflation hits when you least expect it.

There are those who will gamble, who will feel lucky, who will try to beat the odds and make a killing.  For those we have included the stock exchange and futures market.  There is a fortune to be made there, or lost.  A player may choose to speculate in real estate, buy a home to get a tax break or keep his assets liquid by renting.  All of these choices, and more, are yours and after all LIFE IS RUFF is only a game...or is it?

OBJECTIVE:

Each player attempts to obtain a survival package of items that have intrinsic value and are counter-cyclical to inflation.  (Their value rises with inflation instead of declining.)  Players, of course, must have cash to purchase these items (gold, silver, food storage, collectibles, diamonds, property) and the purchasing power of the dollar declines as the game progresses causing prices to rise.  The player who has the greatest number of survival assets (points) when RUNAWAY INFLATION strikes (making paper money worthless) is the best prepared and is the WINNER.

The rules on the box are rather difficult to understand, though they are brief. Figuring out what these rules mean would require attempting to play the game without understanding it at all. From the box, but really incomprehensible (grammar and spelling mistakes in the original!):

2. - Player may take any item to start with but not jump or land on any item from then on.

3. - When an item lands on 'C' square player draws a card:
  A. If own item place face up in front of player.
  B. If an opponents item, give them the card which they place face up in front of them.
  C. If card from position not being played place face down in discard pile.
  D. If a Missed Payment card take item back to start.
  E. If a Paid off Mortgage card take item to finish position. Home!
  F. If you draw an opponents Open House card give them the card and you get 3 rolls of the die. (3 extra turns).

4. - The only time an item is safe is when the player has the card face up in front of them.

5. - The exact number must be rolled to get into the Bank as well as Home and if all items reach finish position before player has all their cards, they draw a card on their turn until they have all five cards. If a Missed Payment card or  Paid off Mortgage card is draw, disregard and place in discard pile. If you draw an opponents card rule 3B applies and if an opponent draws your card Rule 4 applies and the item starts over.

6. - If all the cards are used up and there is no winner reshuffle the cards, place back in the Estate and continue following the above rules until there is a winner.

From the rules:

Like its predecessor, GOOD OLD HOUSES, this game focuses player attention on specific architectural details and on the stylistic variety of historic buildings.  MAIN STREET, however, brings attention to downtown buildings, structures which, in the hustle and bustle of commercial life, escape the notice of even frequent passers-by.  Our illustrations show each style with its original storefront, but because storefronts are periodically remodeled, one is lucky to find historic storefronts intact.  MAIN STREET players will find themselves looking at the upper levels of commercial buildings to recognize styles they have learned in the game.

The range of styles in MAIN STREET from Federal to Art Deco/Modern, isn't intended to encompass the breadth of American Architectural history, but to represent some basic styles often used in commercial buildings between the late eighteenth and mid-twentieth centuries.

The eight building puzzles (nine pieces per puzzle) are used in five different games for 1 to 8 players Ages 5 and up.

Usually these names will be familiar, but ever so often an unknown will rear his head in a bid for greatness.

Data Boxing is the boxer's Boxing Game. It's a detailed, realistic simulation of boxing where boxers of all eras are matched.  There is a real component to it because it's based on the actual performance of boxers. Individual fighters are rated on cards, and bouts are resolved through dice and charts and/or rounds cards (see Data Boxing II below).

Data Boxing is based on decades of study and research. It began as a research project in 1967 by humanities professor and boxing authority, Dr. Julian Compton (1940-2010). The heavyweights were evaluated on up to 155 variables. The table game first appeared in 1976. The computerized version was first released in 2004 which is set up similarly to the board game. The computer implementation was done by NASA programmer Don Mankowski.  Data Boxing was featured in the December 1977 edition of Ring Magazine, The People's Almanac [1978], Computer Sports Match-ups [1981] and in the December 13th, 2006 issue of the Tallahassee Democrat.

A competitive atmosphere is in place as the players bid to prove their worth on the journey by accomplishing Duties and navigating through whirlpools.

A network of arrows make up the routes from start to finish.  Each player equal numbers of counters (of all colors); they move the raft up to 3 arrows (and only along their direction) on their turns by using up counters of the same color as shown on the last whirlpool traversed (the initial departure from Peru can use counters of any color).  When the raft moves onto a whirlpool, it must stop there.  The active player receives a Navigational Certificate and changes the direction of the whirlpool's arrows and its color.  Aside from these certificates, players can receive Duty cards if they land the raft on an arrow that is connected to the Duty tiles placed on the board.

The game ends when the raft reaches the island of Raroio.  The players sum up the points given for their Navigation Certificates and sets of Duty cards.  The winner is the one with the most points.

On your turn, you roll the die to either race or chomp a worm. If you roll a 1-4, you place the number of grubs indicated into your tree stump and press down the plunger. The dough is mashed and forced out the base in a continuous worm shape over the track. You attach a wheeled worm head to the tip of the dough and add side wheels as needed to support your worm's body. Thus the worms get longer and longer as the race progresses. If you roll a Mr. Chomp, you take a bird shaped device, chomp off the head of your opponent's worm, then place the chomped segment into your tree stump to move your worm ahead. Your opponent must then reattach the plastic worm head to the remainder of his or her worm segment.

The first player whose worm grows the entire length of the track, crosses the finish line, and takes the checkered flag is the winner.

15434,Le Tour de France,1961,6,2,3,2,6,150,150,,Racing Sports ,Roll / Spin and Move,"This is the predecessor of Homas Tour, aka Um Reifenbreite.

Each team managers receives at the start of the game 3x frs. 10,- and 2x frs. 5,-. 
At the start you move the racers normally as indicated by the dice. At the next turns however you must pay great attention. On the track are places with a special sign (green star, red circle, etc). Some of these places give an advantage, others a disadvantage to the racer who is placed on it. It is your job as a team manager to try and place your racers as much as possible on the advantage places and to try and avoid the disadvantage places.

Each team manager should have a list as shown on the backside of the Table for time trial. This list is called the Yellow Jersey Standings.The racers who had the most points in the Yellow Jersey standings, is allowed to wear the yellow jersey (the yellow plastic cap is put over this racer) and he receives an additional fee of frs. 40,-.

End of the Tour
The end of the sixth stage is exactly the same as the end of the other stages, but only the racer who now wins (or keeps) the yellow jersey is the winner of the Tour and he receives now a fee of frs. 100,- instead of the usual frs. 40,-.
There are three ways to win the game:

New divison
This is the fastest and most simple way, also suitable for children. In this variant one only plays for the Yellow jersey standings. No money is used and the Green jersey score is not kept. The normally quite long playing time is now considerably shorter. At the end of each stage only the points for the Yellow jersey standings are written down and the corresponding racers receives the yellow jersey.
The winner of the tour is the one, who has the yellow jersey at the end of the Tour.

Amateurs
In this variant money isnt used either (so no fines and/or fees). For both standings are the points written down, so the yellow and green jersey come into play. In both standings will be a winner at the end of the Tour.

Professionals
This is the Tour de France game in its most beautiful and most complete form. In this variant you use: the Yellow jersey standings, the Green jersey standings and the Banks handles all money affairs such as starting fees, race fees fines, etc. This way of playing costs more time then the two previous ways and it will take about 2 or 3 hours.

The objective is to be the first to collect 2 of each type of destination cards.

Destination cards are:
Blue - State Capitals
Green - Natural points of interest
Red - Historical sites
Purple - other points of interest.

Car - move using the solid dots i.e. a highway - the number of spaces on the sum of 2 dice.
Ferry - is like a highway except over the water between 2 cities.
Rail - move along the blue lines - 1 station for each even number on the 2 dice.
Air - Use a spinner (which has a 40/60 chance of success) to any other airport. If your plan is not at the airport where you are, you first need to use the spinner to get the plane to you and in a later move go to the other airport.

When travelling by car, rail, or ferry the player rolls a 3rd die; an even number allows you to move either you or any opponent, while an odd number you can only move yourself.

If you roll doubles when moving by car, rail, or ferry you must take an event card; Play Now cards are played immediately before you move, Play Now or Later cards can be played immediately or held onto for later.

Once you reach your first destination - you must either return to your home base to get a new card, or you can phone home (remember this was the 80's) using the same airplane spinner to get a new card.

The game is for 2-4 players and is played out over 7 rounds, each one represented by a different minigame. In a two-player game the players take turns being the challenger or the gladiator. If the challenger defeats the gladiator in a turn they get markers/points which are used in the last turn. The winner of the last turn is the winner of the entire game.

				
					The different minigames

				
					Gatloppet (The Gauntlet)

In the Gauntlet the challenger tries to outwit the gladiator, while the gladiator tries to predict the challenger's next move. The challenger starts the game by picking cards of two different types. They then play one card at a time, the gladiator trying to match them. The challenger gets to move forward every time the gladiator fails to predict which card the challenger played. If the challenger gets to the finish line before running out of cards, they have won the round and get points depending on how many cards they have left in hand.
				
					Duellen (The Duel, orig. Joust)

The Duel is a card based color matching game where the players simultaneously try to build ladders by combining cards with the same colored symbols on them. The game ends when one player can't continue their ladder. Points are awarded depending on how many cards are left in the player's hand, less than 5 yielding the maximum score. The challenger won't get any points if the gladiator finishes their ladder first.
				
					Ringarna (The Rings, orig. Hang Tough)

The Rings is a tactical challenge played out in six turns. The challenger must move over to the gladiator's space or reach one of the eight scoring squares by playing movement cards. The gladiator's role is to catch the challenger by ending up on their space or to prevent them from reaching the score tiles by blocking their path.
				
					Vggen (The Wall)

In the Wall the challenger tries to reach the top before time runs out or the gladiator catches them. It is played out over seven rounds. In each round the challenger calls out how many spaces they want to move in that turn. They then spin a spinner numbered 1 to 12. The challenger gets to move if the spinner shows the same number or higher. In round 4 the gladiator takes up the chase following the same movement rules but using the gladiator's spinner numbered 4 to 15. The minigame ends after seven rounds or after the challenger has either been caught or reached the top.
				
					Rekylen (Recoil, orig. Snapback)

In Recoil the challenger tries to steal markers from the game board by moving their piece to the desired color. To accomplish this they must have the correct colored card in their hand. If they don't they can chose to play the card turned face down and spin the spinner to try to get the correct color. The gladiator then tries to respond with the same colored card or by spinning the spinner to the same color in order to protect the marker. The minigame is over when the gladiator has played all of their cards.
				
					Attackboll (Attack Ball, orig. Powerball)

In Powerball the challenger tries to place cardboard chits in the receiver by balancing them on a cardboard spoon. The gladiator has a slightly larger spoon with which they try to block the challenger. The minigame ends when the time runs out.
				
					Hinderbanan (The Obstacle Course, orig. The Eliminator)

The Obstacle Course is the final minigame, the winner takes it all. Players take turns trying to match symbols on a track by turning over cardboard tokens, a bit like Memory. The player with the most points from previous minigames starts and gets a number of markers equal to the difference between the players' scores. That player gets to keep turning over tokens until they fail. If they fail and have no markers remaining, the next player gets to start turning over pieces to try to match their symbols. If they do have any markers, they discard one and keep turning over tokens until they are out of markers. The player who first matches all of their symbols wins the entire game.

Activities include charades (get points for making the other players guess which persona you're acting out a particular scene as), trivia (everyone can get a point for answering a true-or-false question), a personal question (you get a point just for giving an answer), nothing (because there's nothing like losing your turn), and arbitrary events such as gaining points or losing your next turn (because there's nothing like effectively losing two turns).

15476,ANSA: Mission to Alpha Centauri,2005,8,1,0,2,4,30,30,,Adventure Exploration Movies / TV / Radio theme Science Fiction Space Exploration ,Point to Point MovementRoll / Spin and Move,"It is January 14, 1972. You are the commander of an ANSA Icarus interstellar exploration spacecraft. Along with your fellow crew of three astronauts, your mission is to be the first human beings to travel to the nearest star system of Alpha Centauri. To do so, your spacecraft will travel at the speed of light on a ten year round trip mission.

ANSA scientist Dr. Otto Hasslein has theorized that there is an anomaly or orphaned space near Alpha Centauri where gravity and light bend to create a time warp. This can cause a spacecraft to experience a distortion in both time and distance. This phenomena has been referred to as a Hasslein curve and is just one of many hazards that interstellar space voyagers will have to contend with.

The objective of this game is to be the first ANSA spacecraft to travel to the star system of Alpha Centauri and return safely to Earth in the year 1982. Steer clear of a Hasslein curve to avoid a time warp. Game includes a frame able 14x14 professionally printed one-fold gaming board, (4) Icarus spacecraft pawns, (4) plastic stands, (40) Event cards, (16) Navigation cards, spinner, instructions and box.

Suez '56 simulates the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt at the time of the 1956 Arab-Israeli War. The Anglo-French objectives were to seize the Suez Canal, which the Egyptians had nationalized, and to possibly also overthrow the regime of Gamel Abd El Nasser. Though the invaders gain their military objectives, they unleashed a political disaster on themselves when the United States joined the Soviet Union in condemning the operation.

This means if there is a red Cocoo in size 4 on one side, there is certainly not a red cocoo and no cocoo in size 4 on the other side.

When the reader encountered a blank, a card was drawn and the word inserted. (He sees a ____ and then later meets a ____ ... and so forth.)

One of the earliest mass-produced games of this type was Peter Coddle's Trip to New York, in which a country bumpkin experiences the wonders of the Big City. This was first produced by the legendary McLoughlin Brothers (NY) and taken up by others, including their competitor Milton Bradley (MA), whose company outlasted them and later bought many of their more popular titles.

Unentschieden! (Europa II) is an expansion for Drang Nach Osten! (Europa I), an historical game/simulation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 that lead to the gates of Moscow and ultimately to the destruction of the Wehrmacht and the fall of the Third Reich. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942. Unentschieden continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire War in the East, 1941-45.

Game Components:


    Four partial mapsheets (numbered Europa 6 through 9).
    Two 10 x 27 and one 8 x 27 mapsheet extending the DNO map to the east
    One 27 x 13 mapsheet estending the DNO map to the south  east
    One set of six supplementary unit countersheets (for a total of 2128 counters) consisting of:
    One Europa sheet 6
    One Europa sheet 7
    Two Europa sheet 8
    One Europa sheet 9
    One Europa sheet 10 (partial sheet)
    One rules folder and cover.
    One set of supplementary charts and tables.
        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle
        One Soviet Order of Appearance
        One Soviet Unit Substitution Chart
        One German Initial Order of Battle
        One German Order of Appearance
        One German Unit Substitution Chart
    


Notes:

Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank/Mechanized Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. Unentschieden adds more unit specialisation, although at 26 pages the combined rules are still quite manageable by today's standards. Drang Nach Osten! with Unentschieden lasts for 52 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Feb I 45) so allowing for one session of several hours per turn, several hundred hours is a realistic playing time.

15620,The Analyst Game,2004,6.32727,11,1,4,8,30,30,,Deduction Humor Party Game ,Pattern RecognitionStorytelling,"The Analyst Game was developed jointly by consumer psychologist Adam Ferrier and ideas company Saatchi  Saatchi. It was borne out of a realization that a) people love hearing what others think about them, and b) people enjoy having the opportunity to safely express what they think about others. The Analyst gives people the chance to understand their friends and family on a deeper level. In return you'll gain a deeper understanding of how others see you.

This boardgame (without a board!) works like this: an Analyst asks questions about a randomly-drawn subject. The Trainee Analysts must provide insightful but not obvious answers about the subject's character. The Analyst must then guess who the subject is. Points are awarded and we move to the next round. Simple ... and fun!

The techniques used in this game are used by therapists and advertising agencies when they want to gain a deeper understanding of people, why they do things and what really drives them. For example during the Bush / Gore election campaign, planning departments in advertising agencies asked people if the presidential candidates came to life as cars, what kind of car would they be? George Bush was seen as a Maserati, Al Gore was a Honda Accord. I'll leave it to you to draw your own conclusions as to why!

The board layout and game play is similar to Trouble with a few exceptions. For example, instead of the Pop-o-matic die, you use 2 dice for movement. Since you need to roll a 6 to start a marble on the track, you can use a 6 on either die or the total of the two. Like backgammon, you can move 2 pieces by using the number on each die, or move 1 piece by using the total on both. If you roll doubles, you get to take an additional turn. Finally, in Kippy Koo, a marble need only cross the finish line to exit the board (no exact rolling is needed).

This game features a double-sided board (Sunny Side and Blizzard Size) and weather cards that recount some of the actual events of the 1977 blizzard.  The game was reworked for Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Syracuse, Providence, and Boston as well.

15655,Take,1985,5,2,0,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Point to Point Movement,"Take is played with 15 counters each, on a hexagonal board made up of 80 triangles.

From the packaging:
Take is a game that requires players to go on the attack and can never be won by defensive play.
You will find that it is a game one can play at all levels: from the simple removal of pieces off the board, to very intricate chess-like moves with defensive walls, decoys, sacrifice ploys and carefully worked out strategies and counter-moves.

Two divisions of VC and NVA troops numbering a total of 15,000 men tried to seize the city of Tay Ninh during the Tet Offensive of 1968, defending the city was 1st brigade of the 25th division, 23rd artillery group, 34th armor battalion and several air and helicopter squadrons.

What ensued was a battle that would last 10 days and pitted U.S. firepower vs. NVA/VC manpower.

In the end, the NVA lost 1,000 men vs. 80 men and a few tanks and vehicles for the U.S. The NVA and VC troops were forced to retreat.

This game has 176 counters, each turn represent 1 day and each hex is 1/2 mile across. All ARVN units are companies, the NVA units are all either battalion and company and the U.S. units are platoon sized.

Mist of the Ardennes covers the Battle of the Bulge. The first 26 pgs are devoted to the battle, while the next eleven pgs are actual rules and the final ten pgs cover the charts, table, set-ups, etc. that come with a game. 
The map is in two pieces, each 11x17 and looks amazingly like SPIs Wacht Am Rhein that I can see (my copy is MINT and I refuse to open it all up), including coloring and style. Judging by the fact that the game lasts five days of the campaign (the 16th to 20th of Dec) and the units included (no SS, but the 2nd PZ and Lehr Pz Divisions), I would guess that the game covers the opening assault by the 5th Panzer Army against Clervaux and the 28th US infantry division. 
The game has battalion-sized units almost exclusively. Units have only one combat number and some sort of morale or training rating as there are several units with one or two stars between the combat and movement numbers. The main thing is that the game uses strength points reduction-there are roster sheets for record-keeping of unit losses. The CRT is by strength point loss and there is a detailed chart for CRT modifiers, presumably for combined arms. Also, next to the strength point boxes are a number of boxes for each unit for each day. I would gather that the game tracks unit fatigue as well. There are barrage and range values on artillery and support and range numbers on the regimental HQ units.

Units are of indeterminate size, but include Elephants, ships, and leaders as well as infantry. Also, the counters use mostly Japanese characters, except for the Arabic numerals. 
Movement in the game looks to be controlled by leaders, with interception being available to the non-phasing player. Combat units are counted by points and the CRT is percentage-based for losses.

As its name implies, this is a alternative history of the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The counters have a combat and movement value with some of the troops having their combat number in parenthesis (the musket-armed troops I bet, but there does seen to be a lot of them). There is a neat time spiral in the middle of a roster page (what is recorded there, I have no idea), as the CRT is a push-style one, with the results of AD, AR Eng, DR and DD. Apparently the game lasts twelve turns, but there is no indication of turn length, map or unit scale.

Two identical 11x17 maps, two 11x17 color PAC (one for each player), one PAC, 504 counters, 24-pg. rulebook. Only the historical scenario is presented. The game takes 32 turns.

Units are divisions with no combat values. Each division has an associated marker for use on the PAC. The players PACs are tracking intensive, recording supplies, combat efficiency, reinforcement appearance, and much, much more. Many of the rules cover the interaction of the markers on the PACs during combat. I imagine most of the game here is managing your PAC correctly vis--vis the map.

Other counters include DD tanks, commandos, coastal artillery, strong points, naval bombardment and TAC air markers and a whole handful with Japanese text (which is somewhat rare in Japanese games actually).

This game is way up on my list of games needing translation. It almost looks like one of the old double-blind games (with the two identical maps), except that there are no apparent rules for those procedures. Maybe I received an extra map by mistake? A very interesting-looking game indeed.

15689,Panzer Division Kommandeur,1985,6,7,3,1,2,360,360,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"One mapsheet, 504 counters, one 24-pg rule/scenario booklet (8 scenarios ranging from 1940 to 1945), three PAC (two are identical). Only 10  pages of the book are actual rules, the rest being scenarios, historical information and designers notes.

The units are German, Russian, French, British and US. They and have large, white Ds on the backside (presumably meaning Disrupted/Disorganized). Markers include Fired, and Reaction, with two levels of improved positions. Artillery may use ranged fire. The charts and tables include five combat-related tables, three of them detailing unit interaction. Each players card also has two tracks on which to record information. No indication of turn length or scale. No indication of unit size.

15691,Monopoly: Historic Boston,1998,3.4,5,0,2,8,120,120,,Economic Negotiation ,Auction/BiddingRoll / Spin and MoveSet CollectionTrading,"Traditional tokens are used, however the properties have a local historic flavor to them.

From the box:

From Pilgrims and patriots to her legendary resistance, heroic battles and stalwart ships, Boston served as a hotbed of revolutionary activity and cradle of the thirteen colonies' desire for liberty and self-determination.

Freedom of thought and the right of private judgment in matters of conscience, driven from every other corner of the earth, direct their course to this happy country as their last asylum, Samuel Adams, Boston Patriot and Politician On Freedom of Thought.

Come.  Gather family and friends to play this Boston edition of the Monopoly Game and watch historic Beantown come to life.  Be risk takers and deal makers, as were our Boston ancestors.  Trade in landmark properties and become part of the living history that is Boston.

15692,Battle of Ravenna: Renaissance Art of War,1985,6,2,0,1,2,360,360,Wargames,Medieval Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"SGB-12 Battle of Ravenna (1985) (JPY 5,800)

Subtitled Renaissance Art of War.

One die-cut mapboard (22 x 34), one sheet of counters, one roster pad of double-sided sheets, one PAC, one 40-pg rule/scenario/historical booklet (4 scenarios) and one strange little d10 (it has almost 14 sides, but only ten numbers). Only about 20 pgs contain the actual rules. The game appears to cover only one battle, broken into four scenarios with the campaign game being the last. Battle of Ravenna is unique in that it is the only Ad Technos game to ever have a mounted mapboard. It is very similar to what Avalon Hill used the early 90s with similar results (bowing of the map).

The counters each have five numbers on them-firepower, melee, movement and some sort of morale values (written as either + or -). There are a bunch of strength point counters as well to go along with the roster sheets. Most of the counters are in Japanese script. Units must face a vertex, with limited front facing allowed depending on the unit type. Many of the rules look to involve the firing and targeting of the various units, including cavalry charges and the ability of units to react to that.

DotE contains one map, stretching from Dunkerque and Paris on the west edge to Roermoon and Luxemburg City on the east edge. There are 756 counters, along with 8 PAC, many of them off-map strength tracks. There is a 28 pg rulebook and a 24 pg Historical Notes booklet.

This is nothing more than a modified version of Kevin Zuckers Campaigns of Napoleon system, period. The differences I can see are not using individual combat units with historical IDs, instead the designer chose to use icon units (such as artillery or infantry) combined with strength point markers to go underneath. Also, leaders are not on the map and forces are represented by numbered force markers instead. There is an AP Table, but no Attrition Table. The CRT is vastly different, with the addition of negative numbered results and D and DD results (would sure like to see those!). There is also the ubiquitous Paris Morale Track.

Two 11x17 country displays (Japan  USA), divided into provinces (5 for the USA and 8 for Japan). Two thick pads of one-sided record sheets (each 5x8). One heavy cardstock PAC (presumably a stand-up display since it has identical info on both sides). One sheet of 156 counters which have a building-looking symbol on half ad a PR on the other half, divided equally between the colors. One rulebook (16 pgs).

Looks to be a product management game, instead of a resource management game. A few tables for determining production and a few for maybe value or growth. Some of the record keeping looks to be done in secret.
