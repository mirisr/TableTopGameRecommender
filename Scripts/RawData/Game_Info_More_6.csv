The spaceships are mounted on antennae and plastic joints, which combine to allow a remarkable range of positions -- for example, one could have a ship positioned upside down seven inches off the playing surface.  Movement is determined simultaneously and then resolved, often resulting in disaster for the inexperienced pilot.

Tactical space combat over the surface of the moon, using miniatures mounted on custom 3D telescoping flight stands. Each player is given two figures and stands for each of his ships, allowing him to see his old position while figuring his next movement (the extra ships are in play only during that ship's movement) - optional rules allow play with single figures. Each ship has a fighter display for tracking status. Weapons include a variety of lasers; the advanced rules add the paralyzer glue gun; resource rules also cover bombs, rockets, and missiles. Data is provided for four fighters plus non-combatants. The rulebook also provides Mission Builder random mission and campaign rules, a pilot development system, and a brief introduction to lunar terrain.

Boxed set includes:

80-page, 8.5 x 11 rules booklet

One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?

To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition  and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.

To set up Westwrts, twenty wagon cards  along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger  are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.

The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.

The frightful Phantom is on the move and spreading fear and fright.  He has kidnapped a beautiful, young woman from the village and brought her to the castle Zitterstein to an underground hiding place whose secret doors open only to the sound of a Violin and the smell of Roses.

Object of the Game
Each player must find a Violin and a certain number of Roses in the underground labyrinth:

With 2 players 6 Roses
With 3 players 4 Roses
With 4 players 3 Roses
With 5 and 6 players 2 Roses.

The first player to advance to the hiding place of the Beauty with a Violin and the correct number of Roses wins the game.

Contents
1 Gameboard
1 Phantom figure
6 Player's pawns
1 Large Phantom die
6 Special dice
32 Hexagon Tiles
24 Magic Cards
14 Roses
6 Violins
1 Rule book

How to play:
The oldest player begins the game.  He gets all the dice and rolls the black dice first.  He selects one of the dice and moves his pawn according to the number shown. Afterwards the second player takes one of the remaining dice and moves his pawn. Then the third player follows, etc.  The last player in a round must take the last remaining die.

Once all players have moved the start player rolls the large white die and move the Phantom accordingly.

Then all the dice are passed to the next player in a clockwise direction who follows the same procedure.

The Phantom
The player who rolled the black dice in this round moves the Phantom.  After all players finish their turns with the black die, he rolls the white die and moves the Phantom in any direction.  Afterwards the next player in a clockwise direction receives all the dice and the next round begins.

How Does the Phantom Move?
The Phantom leaves his Start place in any direction.
The Phantom may land on and over wall spaces and can also stop there. Phantom can move through rooms. It enters and leaves a room from any space.  The room represents a space and costs one point of movement.  The Phantom may not enter the End Space or a Violin Space.  He also may not move over them.

The White Phantom Die
It shows 1 - 5 pips and a Phantom.  The pips mean that the Phantom is moved a corresponding number of fields. If the white die shows the Phantom, the Phantom must be moved into an arbitrary room.  Then the player throws the white die one more time and the Phantom moves that number of spaces from the new room. The Phantom is an Obstacle. No pawn may land on or pass through a space that the Phantom is standing on.

The game ends when the player that possesses a Violin and the required number of Roses can enter the End space.  A player that reaches it only by exact count is the winner.

2630,Die Bombe,1998,5.51429,21,1,3,6,20,20,,Card Game ,,"In each round, 2 cards are placed face up. Players then secretly bid on for those cards. The highest bidder can pick one of the two cards to keep. However, that player also receives minus points in the amount of his bid. The player with the second-highest bid gets the remaining card for nothing.

The cards
There are 6 bombs, 12 red and 12 green value cards. The value cards are worth from 3 ?25 in both colors. The values ascend by twos: 3, 5, 7, 9 ... 25.

Preparation
Each player receives a paper and a pen. Each player prepares a small table for the minuses on his paper. Leave enough space for bids beside the table.

The bombs and the value cards are first separated. The value cards are mixed, and 2 are put on the table face up, side by side. The remaining value cards are now shuffled well with the 6 bombs and the stack is placed face down in the middle of the table.

Play
Each player secretly makes a bid.  All players must bid at least 1. Bids can be no higher than 40. Now all players announce their bids.

1. The player with the highest number writes it in his deficit table. Now he can select one of the two face-up cards and keeps it in front of him.

2. The player with the second-highest number takes the remaining face-up card and keeps it in front of him. He does not write in his deficit table.

Now all players cross out their listed bids. The top two cards of the face-down stack are uncovered and the next round is played in exactly the same manner. Subsequent rounds are played in this way until the stack is completely spent. Then the final scores are announced.

Each player must display all cards won in plain view, with colors separated. Each individual number must be visible.

The bombs
When a player takes a bomb, it must be played immediately. The player gives the bomb to a player of his choice covering one of his red or green value cards! The player receiving the bomb must set it and the covered value card aside so that it will score nothing at the end of the game.

What happens if several players tie for the highest bid?
 Only the players who tied for the highest bid continue to bid on the card. Only 1 card is up for bid  and the remaining face-up card is put aside.

Final score
First the red cards are totaled, then the green in the same manner. Each player adds the values of his red cards. The player with the most red cards doubles the sum of his red cards; all others receive only their normal red-card points. If several players tie for the most red cards, all these players double their red points.

The points for the red and green cards are added. Minus points are subtracted. The total value of all cards won and minuses are announced at the end the game. The player with the highest score is the winner.

On your move, you roll two dice (black and white); you move as indicated by the white die (1-6), adding the black die (1-3) if you choose to.  Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).

Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.

You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each Dip rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the cancel dip die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.

If you total more than 4, you're busted and your piece goes off board, plus a chip is added to the pot (initially seeded with 1 chip).  As pieces move, they push those in front of them on the track.  There are two exit tracks where you get to push pieces over the side.  Whenever this happens, you also add a chip to the pot.  You can get back on track only if there is a carrier piece available.

As you pass the pot, you grab the chips there (and seed it again with a chip).  First player to 10 chips wins.

The board is a 4x4 grid with pictures of different houses along the vertical and horizontal planes, the higher the house, the better the initial weather. The game starts with weather tiles being randomly placed face down onto the grid. The tiles stay that way for much of the game, which means Donnerwetter has a memory element. The idea is to place your prediction marker and trying to change the weather tiles to match. The rest of the game is spent moving and laying tiles with limited intelligence, trying to get your predictions to come right.

On the reverse side of the wide smoke cards are various landscapes. The narrow smoke cards contain horizons (end caps, think El Caballero)and clouds. A stream of nine cards is placed rising up from a fire;  the narrow smoke cards are always face down, the wide smoke cards are first shown to everyone and then placed face down.

On your turn, you point to one of the wide smoke cards from spaces 4-9 (not the first three next to the fire) and claim what it is.  If correct, you take it and keep going until you miss.  The smoke raisings (?? don't know what this means!) the smoke raisings????....) with each card taken and new cards are added to the bottom.  Alternatively you can take a narrow card.  If it is a horizon, you take it and your turn ends.  If a cloud, the rain gets closer and this paces the game.  You need horizons to score so you will take this action often.

You score by creating complete landscapes.  Each wide smoke card gets 5 points, narrow smoke cards get 1, and there are bonuses for special collections of landscape cards.  The game uses money simply, making you pay the previous player if you take the card they incorrectly identified. In close games the money at the end can be influential.

should fortune smile, to reach the financial position to be named Doge of Venice. Precious 
goods are available to all, but between the Venetian merchants and a thousand dangers stand
expensive tolls, desert raiders or the worst misfortune of all, terrible Genoan pirates just
waiting for the incautious traveler to make a false step in order to clean him out. All of these 
don't even take into account the variations in market prices that, with a simple roll of the dice, 
could change a fortune into ruin! Up to 6 merchants can try, traveling on earth or sea as they
prefer, this wonderful adventure, which is offered to all players who love games. The refined 
graphics of Samarcanda, based on the colors gold, white and green, provide also a
visual pleasure. Moreover the simplicity of the rules, added to the wide variety of situations
that can be created, allows a pleasant passage of time, even to those who, after a hard day's
work, do not want to deal with complex rules. So we invite you therefore, on behalf of the 
International Team, to return to the fantastic times of fabulous medieval merchant traders. 
Upon which, amidst the experiences of day-to-day modern life, it is impossible not to regard 
without nostalgia and interest.

Each player takes a turn as broker, and sells certificates for points or buys them back until the market closes; the next player then takes over as broker.

After a round of each player being broker, the points are totaled for each player with the greatest amount winning.

This game was produced during wartime; it is unavailable now but it can be played without the components provided and with just pen and paper.

Only the card holder knows the answers on the card. It's up to the card holder to select the answer thats most likely to be chosen by the other players. But players must choose shrewdly because the more uncommon the answer, the higher the point value.

The Objective is to be the first player to reach 100 points; card holder and players receive points for matching the card holders answer.  All-match bonuses and blind doubles make the gameplay even more exciting.

2752,Combat Cards,1984,3.23077,13,1,2,6,90,90,Wargames,Card Game Wargame World War II ,PartnershipsSecret Unit Deployment,"An abstract game of military strategy set in World War II

This card game is played in partnerships by two, four or six people.  Each team represents the combined resources of a bloc of nations at war with the other team.  Points are accumulated by conducting offensives, opening new fronts and successfully countering enemy offensives.  The game ends once all the cards have been drawn and played.

On your turn, you may shift a combat card between two of your fronts before drawing and playing or discarding a card.  Fronts are prepared face down, until the offensive is declared.  Fronts are laid out like in Caesar  Cleopatra (or Hera  Zeus --those kinds of games).  Cards come in two types, combat and special.  The combat cards represent units of infantry, armor, mine fields and so on.  Special cards include Strategic Bombing (which permanently reduces a player's hand size), New Front, Offensive/Supply (which launches or sustains an offensive, or can be used to shift Airborne combat cards between fronts).

Points are scored mostly during offensives; every turn an offensive goes on, the difference between the attacker's total offense and the defender's total defense is scored by the stronger side.  There is also a bonus point score when opening a new front.

The cards are very bland looking with a simple APP-6 or SPI-style symbol, a pair of offense/defense ratings and some explanatory text.  Most combat units lack character: Armour, Infantry and Combat Engineers work nearly the same way except for their different offense/defense ratings.  I'd have given the Combat Engineers a special power against Mine Fields, for example.

2768,Combo,1997,4.40625,8,1,2,4,10,10,,Dice ,,"Combo is a game in which Bingo-like cards (on which 5x5 grids are printed) are used and instead of calling out randomly drawn numbers, dice are used.

Each player is given a Combo card and during a player's turn, he or she rolls a red die and 3 white dice.  If the red die's result matches one of those on his or her card, the player then matches and places their white dice to the printed faces in the column below.  A player may also steal and use a white die that another player cannot use (because that player's red die column does not have that white die's face).  The next player in turn then picks up and rolls the red die and 3 white dice to do the same.  When a player has filled up an entire row, column or diagonal (the center space is considered already to be filled), he has scored a Combo (the amount of points received depends on whether it is a 4-die or 5-die row, column, or diagonal) and ends a round.  The next round begins with new cards for everyone.

After completing a pre-determined number of rounds, the player with the highest accumulated score is the winner.

2796,Quickely Dice,2001,4.25,4,2,2,6,60,60,,Card Game Dice ,,"Quik E Ly Dice is part dice game, part card collecting and melding game.
A single set consists of 8 dice in 2 colours and 54 cards, 27 of in each of the same two colours as the dice.
One set is suitable for two players, and there are three sets in all; Using all three with half the 162 cards allows up to six players.
The cards depict two dice faces, one above the other. The object is to score points by collecting and then melding the cards, a la rummy.
Players may meld numerical sequences of up to 11 cards, scoring 1 point for each card in the meld. These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row. For example, a sequence showing Red 1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/6 would score 16 points; 4 points for the 1,2,3,4 sequence along the top row, multiplied by 2 for all the cards being the same color, multiplied by 2 again for the 4,5,6 sequence along the bottom. There are several other bonuses which may be scored. 
The mechanics of the game are very simple. Several cards will be face up on the table at any one time. Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.
Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card. Thus, rolling a 1, 4, 5 will allow you to capture a 5/1, a 4/1 or a 5/4 card, provided they are available.
If a player rolls just one of the numbers on a card that he/she wants, that player may reserve that card by placing the single dice on the card. If the player subsequently rolls the second number in a later turn, he/she can take the card. Reserved cards may still be captured by other players.

2801,Goldraub in London,1986,5.87222,18,3,3,6,45,45,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Novel-based ,,"Components of Gold Robbery in London include 1 game board, 37 sector cards, 12 tip cards, 1 search

author of more than 150 detective and adventure novels. The numbers on the hexagonal board 
correspond to those on the sector cards. Tip cards either say false tip or gold bar. Each player
receives a copy of the police gazette, one of each of the two types of tip cards and three sector cards.
Each player tries to find out what cards the other players have. Landing on a space, the player asks
and if players have the corresponding cards, they show the positive tip card, otherwise they show the
negative card.  Each player also gets to find out what the player to their right showed. When someone
feels they have located the exact place where gold has been hidden, he can interrupt the game and
see if he is right.  If correct, he gets a huge bonus, but if wrong takes a major hit to his score.

2802,War in Europe,1976,6.99755,143,3.9091,2,3,360,360,Wargames,Economic Political Wargame World War II ,Dice RollingHex-and-CounterVariable Player Powers,"War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.

The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22x34) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2 cardboard pieces.

The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.

Each 3/4 hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.

Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.

Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.

Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.

The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.

The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.

The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.

A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.

The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.

The game contains: 
- 3600 counters

        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)

The board is circular and divided into ten concentric rings. Twenty-four spokes combine with them to form a grid. Players each have a wooden balloon which shows its altitude by stacking it up, insecurely it seems, on small wooden disks. They also receive at start four ascent cards and four descent (gas bottle) cards. A wooden arrow on a
disk at the center shows the current wind direction. Players move by rolling two dice, a special one which describes a change in wind direction or a requirement on the player and an ordinary one which gives the amount to move. There are actually three games in one, all centered around getting a balloon to a specific location, the first two based on real life balloonist games: a chase or fox hunt and a target race. The third scenario describes a race to the center of the board.

I don't think you can take opposing pieces (sending them back to the serpent's tail), but it seems you can form blockages and maybe even you can move back and forth as desired.

Once again, the object of the game is to prevent the opponent from having any moves by blocking and taking pieces.

The two central spaces are special, and each player owns his home row, leaving two central rows over which the struggle plays out.  Each player attempts to prevent the other from having any remaining moves, by occupying spaces and taking his ten pieces away.  Stacking is involved --I think you get to move a stack if it is topped by one of your pieces, and if you bring it into your home row you capture the opposing pieces?

The large board is themed with the signs of the Zodiac and has 5 concentric rings (orbits) and spirals forming the path of life. There is a large (11cm) latex statuette of Lady Luck and players spend tokens, representing years of their life, to an altar to move themselves and the statuette around the board. They can also block spaces with fire tokens. When each player has spent all its tokens, it has died. When the last player dies, whoever Fortune is nearest to, first collects tokens from the altar as a multiple of their age (the orbit they reached) by the number of players. The next player does the same, but multiplied by one less and so on. Presumably the basic game ends with the player with the most tokens winning (the rules don't say!). The advanced game rules allow additional variants, such as bidding or bartering or a quiz based game. One variant goes on to use the won tokens as the start of the After-Life and the designer, Dr Bronia Grycz, encourages players to develop their own rules. The box has copyright 1977.

Players at a dinner party throw food at each other over the table and try to dodge what is thrown at them in a vain effort to stay clean. Players are dealt 5 cards each and the rest are laid face down to form the table. The cards are FOOD to be thrown (having a Splat Factor and Dodge Factor), DODGE to dodge food (having a Dodge Factor), EVENT cards (e.g. Catch, Grab, Oops, Butler etc.) to allow actions, and OBJECT cards (e.g. the host's furniture, paintings etc.). You play cards onto each other and draw from the table until the cards run out. If you dodge food, it might hit an object and the host will hassle the thrower (who misses goes). When players can no longer play cards, whoever has the least food on them is allowed to think they have won.
The production is fairly simple, the graphics are basic (b  w), and the rules are chatty and a bit unclear. The result is an OK game that tries to be funny. There are no secrets.

It features a large three-fold board of a fine painted lake, sets of large cards with excellent artwork and unbelievably, 6 different solid pewter figures of fishers and two little pewter rowboats. There is even a Record Book to keep a diary of your days by the lake.
And days it will be, because, despite the wonderful attention to detail and genuine care taken in its making, this is a deadly dull game of dice rolling and dice rolling and dice rolling. You first seed the board with little paper tiles showing fish on one side  their weight hidden below. Then you have to roll dice to walk round the lake to your chosen fishing spot (why???), roll dice to use the rowboat, roll dice to hook a fish, roll dice to reel it in, roll dice as the fish runs and so on. The cards are used as part of landing the fish, being Run, Hazard  Problem cards. So it may run straight to you, but if it slips into the reeds, you lose your catch.
No doubt habitual fishers will enjoy the tedium and it may well be a fine simulation of the sport, but any gamers will go mad.

Absolutely typical for a British product, a classic case of theme before game, no idea of a mechanism beyond dice and hazard cards. The graphic artist is named, but the actual designer is not. I suspect it is the eponymous Anglepen. The producers included an order form for parts, baseball cap, T-shirt and future accessories.

The board has the usual track of famous British companies (Tarmac, Racal, Tesco, Courts), decks of Fact Cards and Venture Cards, a die showing cash gains, a huge stack of plastic money chips for each player and a genuine Casio HL-811 calculator in its own box!
You need the calculator because the game also has a book of actual weekly share prices for each company. On your turn, you buy into one firm or another by placing chips onto the board. Later you may sell your investment, making a profit or loss as the prices fluctuate. You draw a Fact Card, which gives info about the price of gold, the currency exchange rates, the FTSE index (the UK's Dow Jones) for a certain week. Based on that info, you decide if your shares will be up or down and whether to sell or hold. If you sell, the Banker checks the actual price in the Market booklet and debits or credits you accordingly. Rolling a VC on the die draws a Venture Card, with the usual hazards and gains to your cash.
More of a crude stock market simulation than a game of strategy, the makers proposed selling fresh decks of Fact Cards and Market booklet for successive years.

Movement is handled through rounds of card play during which cards are played and then reacted to in order to eliminate all the cards in your hand.  Dinosaur cards have values ranging from 1-5 while Escape cards have values ranging from +1 to +3.  In order to play a Dinosaur atop another Dinosaur, it must be greater in value than the preceding card.  Escape cards may be played on any Dinosaur and these also allow you to play an additional Dinosaur card.

Once someone has gone out, movement on the board (of players and the Spinosaurus) is based upon the last played card.

If the Spinosaurus lands on your pawn, you are knocked back (not eliminated).

First pawn/player to reach the Final Escape space wins.

The components are very nice looking, making the game worthwhile despite its rather low ludical (??? what word should be here instead of ludical!!)  quality --it was the Ancient Egyptian equivalent of Snakes  Ladders.  (It appeared fairly late in Egyptian history, during the New Kingdom)

In a nutshell, each player races his team of pieces (hound- and jackal-headed sticks, respectively) on his side of the race track, which includes a couple of ladder/snake shortcuts.  The rules are archaeologists' best guess.  Since each player races on a separate track, there is apparently no direct player interaction.  But I've been mulling over the idea of having a player's special spaces affect the other player's pieces --just to get some direct interaction.

And, amazing as it may seem, the plot is never the same.

Each player assumes the part of one of the Characters in AUNT CORA'S red brick house, and by his actions and positions in the house-hold follows thru with his likes and dislikes of the various persons with whom fate has placed him.  The player, represented on the board by a hollow token, roams about inside and outside the house, choosing and concealing weapons with which to commit a crime.  The strong arm of the law, in the person of Mr. Ree, is ever present patrolling the grounds surrounding the house.

2945,Teufel nochmal!,1988,5.1,10,1,3,4,30,30,,Card Game ,Betting/WageringRock-Paper-Scissors,"Players start with 8 cards and 8 wooden chips of various values (2 each of values 0, 1, 4,  7). The start player leads a card and then all players place a wood chip face down in front of them.  The winner of the trick will take all of the wooden chips and score them as points, so players play chips according to how likely they think they are to win the trick.

Each player then plays a card in order (other than the start player, who has already played a card).  The trick is resolved using the paper/scissors/stone mechanism (using cards showing Gretel, Kasper, and a crocodile) [Punch, Judy,  Crocodile in the English edition].  Teufel [devil] cards act as a trump. Whoever wins the trick takes the cards and the chips.

After all tricks have been played, all cards are discarded except the crocodiles and the chips.  The chips are positive points for the players; the crocodiles are negative points.  Several hands are played, and the winner is the one with the most points at the end.

This game is very similar to Battleship, with a few additional rules.  Each player has a gameboard (printed on cardstock-paper), later boards from the late 70's were printed on plastic with no backing at all, with 3 islands on it.  Players place all of their units on their board (secretly; you can't see your opponent's board) at the beginning of the game.  Units consist of Head Quarters, Tanks, Pill Boxes, Battleships, Destroyers, Landing barges, Aircraft Carriers, and Planes.

The objective is to locate which island the enemy HQ is on (when you sink the enemy Battleship, they must tell you if their HQ is on the North or South half of the board), destroy all enemy installations in that island, and send a landing barge to occupy it.  You can also win the game by destroying both enemy barges (so they have no way to land on your HQ island anymore) or by destroying all enemy planes and ships (they can no longer attack).

Jean Shepherd (best known for the movie A Christmas Story) mentioned an ad for Task Force on his June 18, 1963 radio show. It's not clear if he is discussing game 2982, 13059 or another version of this game.

And isn't that what life is all about?

1.  Building your network to connect to more towns, cities, and big cities
2.  Destroying other people's trains during missions

Finally, a set of scoring cards helps make score-keeping a little clearer.

2996,Dodge City,1983,5.65556,27,2.6,2,5,60,60,,American West ,Area Control / Area Influence,"Directly from the rules:

The board shows the western town Dodge City. The players fight for the dominance over the important buildings of Dodge City.

The players have stake and cards for this fight. They can purchase wooden pieces of a certain color in form of a Lady, Gunman, Sheriff, Bandit or Cowboy, which each player will place on the fields of the buildings. The Lady piece is the most expensive piece, the Cowboy the cheapest.

Events and duels keep the fight open and fair for all players. A player able to connect all important fields of a building with his pieces will win the dominance over this building and gets points for that. The Lady pieces are worth the most points while the Cowboy pieces are worth the least points.

A player having 6 points wins the dominance over Dodge City and thus the game.

Play is on a 7x7 board, but the black and white squares are rotated 45 degrees so as to appear as diamonds to the players. There are 9 pieces per side: 5 runners and 4 guards. The object is to get a runner from your back row to the opponent's back row. Runners may move one space forward or to either side, but not backwards. Guards may move any number of unobstructed spaces in any of the 4 directions. Due to the diamond formation, guards are always on black squares and runners always on white squares.

Runners may be captured if 2 enemy guards occupy adjacent spaces. Multiple runners may be captured in one move of a guard in this manner. Guards may never be captured. Play ends when one runner makes it to the enemy back line, or all of one side's runners are eliminated.

This game plays quickly and easily. There aren't a lot of pieces, and the runners are in constant jeopardy from the guards. This is a game of deterrent: making sure your opponent doesn't take your pieces by setting up attacks of your own.

The sides seem to be the safest places for runners, but they're very vulnerable anywhere.

A lite game that is perfect for a few quick matches on a rainy day.

Similarly to RR, the players draw routes they control on a map in the first part of the game and race to/from randomly determined cities.  There are some important differences.

In the building phase:  Instead of building a short section of track each turn, players buy an entire route between 2 cities.  The price of the route is determined by its length + $2.  This continues until one player has less than $50 left.  This speeds up the building phase considerably.

In the racing phase:  All players who compete in the race receive a share of a pot of $30.  Ties on the same number of dice rolled, split their shares of the pot.

Many maps for different countries have been published.

Each player manages a team of 11 players (10 players and a goalkeeper) on a rectangular board with the lines of a football pitch printed on it and overlaid with a grid.

In a regular game, the two players set up their teams (of 10 players and a goalkeeper) in their halves.  One side is nominated the home team (the other, the away team) and starts off the game.  The game is played in turns.  During each turn, the team in possession of the ball passes or kicks the ball, and moves 3 players.  The opposing team then moves 3 of its players to interfere with the other's play.  Different playing positions of the team (e.g. striker, dribblers, etc) move differently.

The aim of the team in possession of the ball is to put the ball into the net of the opposing team (thus scoring a goal), and its opponent aims to stop it from doing so by blocking the paths towards goal and tackling opposing players to gain possession of the ball.  Whether a ball is kicked accurately to its target location or how much it deviated off-course is determined by the roll of a die.  The results of tackles are determined by comparing dice rolls.

The game lasts until a pre-determined time elapses (in which case the team who has scored the most goals wins) or a team has scored a pre-determined number of goals (and wins).  The game includes rules for variants such as Hocus Pocus cards that allow players to change the events of play, customization of each individual player (introducing ability points and skills), and league play.

taken. Players are also limited to a maximum of 12 cards in their hand at the end of their turn and must
discard any excess.

The board depicts a motor racing circuit which varies in width from 2 squares to 4. The winner is the first past the post and the rules recommend a minimum of 3 laps.  The track and other charts are printed on something akin to vinyl.

Drivers choose a speed from 1 - 12 squares with the cost of the moves measured in fuel use.  The larger the change in gears (up or down), the more fuel is used.  Corners have an ideal speed, and exceeding that can cause tire wear, speed loss, and movement to the outside of the curve.  Engine wear at high speeds can also take place.

This is done by drawing and laying tiles, where the edges of the tiles must match those they are laid adjacent to on the paddock boards.  Action cards allow a leader to be kept in check, and the need to keep your herd together so it is harder for others to raid it adds to the decision making.

The game consist of a grid map of Europe at the center. Players must control 7 adjacent areas of Europe to win.

Each player is given 5 armies (represented by 5 metal miniatures) which can be given secret values of 1-5 to represent strength. For movement, a dice is shaken and the points distributed at will throughout a player's armies. When 2 opposing armies occupy the same space a battle occurs. Players state the values of their armies (a player can attack an opponent with more than one army), but in doing so can bluff this value. The defender can admit defeat and pay one 'power point' for every attacking army, or not believe the opposing declaration and cards are revealed. The loser now pays 2 'power points' per army. The strength cards are burned and new cards drawn by each player. For every 3 'power points' a player hold, they can control an area of Europe (by claiming it with 1 of their 7 metal towers). If a player runs out of points, a tower must be cashed back in and so a region is lost.

A 2 player tile placement game in which one player represents the Coloured world of the Demons, whilst the other represents the Grey world of Concrete! The tiles have a grey side showing workers, police (baton raised!), managers, houses, schools, factories, offices and computers. The other colourful side shows creatures like penguins, spiders, octopii, cats, mice and more fantastic creatures like chimera, sphinx, dragon, and concepts like death, explosion, ruin, nature, puppet-theater, dice, maze, TV and free-public-radio! The Colour tiles have values, multipliers and different abilities, such as removing tiles, affecting distant tiles and so on. These are not obvious, so constantly refering to the rules will slow the game.
Grey has a starting fund and must buy and place or move tiles to generate income. Colour must turn Grey tiles over to disrupt the boring real world and prevent Grey from finishing with a profit. The game can be made harder for Colour by giving Grey more starting money. A totally weird and original game, very nice production, with lovely tiles painted in a naive style.

The Rooks are more powerful than the Queens, resulting from the way they move. A single Rook attacks all 77 squares when other pieces are removed from the board.
The squares actually are circles at the intersections, same way as on the GLE'X board.

3158,The Home Stretch,1970,6.56944,18,1,0,0,60,60,,Racing Sports ,Betting/Wagering,"Horse racing game released by Hasbro and NBC (Yes, the US Television company) in a format nearly identical to the 3M plastic wrap-around boards.

The Home Stretch is a horse racing game. The players represent the owners and jockeys of the horses in the race and the people betting on the race.

To start the game, each player is given a certain amount of cash. This money is used to bid on horses. Each horse is represented by an Ownership Card which shows the horse's name, stable and Speed. Speed is used to determine the likelihood of gaining an Advantage during the race. Bidding for each horse lasts three rounds and the high bidder gets the horse.

Once the horses have been assigned their starting positions are determined and the Ownership Cards are placed in the Readout Machine. This is a tray which holds the cards and will be used to determine movement. After all the horses are in the tray Odds Cards are placed below each Ownership Card. Odds Cards will determine the actual movement of each horse.

Players may now make wagers on any horse they choose. Wagers may be made on any number of horses and may be made for Win, Place or Show. The player records their bets on a Betting Slip and places it face down on the board, then pays the total amount of the bets.

To run the race the spinner is used to generate a random number. This number is used on the Readout Machine to determine the number of spaces moved and the Diagonal Allowance for each horse. Each Odds card has a column of numbers for total movement and a second column for Diagonal allowance. The Diagonal Allowance is the number of diagonal moves the horse may make and is therefore the number of times the horse can change lanes. The horse must use all of its movement but does not have to use all of its allowed lane changes.  The spinner's random number determines which row of numbers on the Odds cards will be used in the current round for moving the horses along the track.

Sometimes the spinner will indicate Advantage. When this happens an Advantage card is drawn. Advantage Cards each show the name of one horse and that horse is allowed a free move of 6 with a diagonal allowance of 2. Other horses may not move. The better a horse's speed, the more Advantage Cards that horse has in the deck.

The race continues until all of the horses have crossed the finish line. If more than one horse crosses the line in the same turn the horse which moves the furtherest past the finish line is the winner. The second and third place horse is determined the same way.

Once all the horses have crossed the finish line the betting slips are revealed and winning wagers are paid. The players then set up the horses and the Readout Machine for the next race. Ownership of the horses remains the same but the starting order and Odds Cards change.

A total of six races are run. The player with the most cash at the end of all six races is the winner.

This is a very good game. Players can spend a good deal of money buying the best horses at the start of the game, but they then have less cash to place bets with. Meanwhile, other players can bet on their horses anyway. Also, the randomness of the appearance of the Advantage Cards mean that a good horse can have a bad showing and the slowest horse may come from behind to win. There is nothing to prevent a player from betting on another horse and racing theirs badly to influence the outcome but the other players may be doing the same thing and the fact that six races are run means that no one is likely to try it more than once (though it may show up as a race 6 strategy). A very interesting game.

The first known game published in the United States.  Unlike other games, it was also invented in the USA rather  than being a copy of a British game, as many later ones were. The publisher were sellers of books in New York and later in 1822 also released Traveller's Tour Through Europe.

A copy is apparently still in existence and archived at the American Antiquarian Society.

Tricks count both for a boat (corresponding to the deck used) and for the player. Players that win a trick select which deck will be used and therefore which boat will win the point.

The first boat that scores 26 points wins. Players then score double for points won from the winning boat. Score is kept on an attractive pad with maps of the Boat Race course.

A card played from the hand can be played only on the UFO card in the circle next to the Planet card. Playing a card gives you the possibility of moving the Planet card accordingly to the value of the card played.
UFO cards are played one at a time and the effect produced by each card is resolved before another card can be played (this gives you the possibility of building a strategy).
A card from the circle can be taken only by cards of the same color. Different colors simply take the place of the card on the table.
Simple math can be a valuable asset in sorting out a strategy.

3215,Smart,1999,6.125,8,0,3,4,45,45,,Economic ,Auction/BiddingSimultaneous Action Selection,"Based on information from the publisher's website:

Smart is about buying, selling and using Smarts in Smartcity. 'Eating' the Smarts determines your emotional situation on the Emotionhead.

In Smart players struggle to be the best Smartdealer and
to become the owner of three new Smartshops. To do this, players buy, sell and use Smarts in the twelve neighborhoods (gameboard).

In trading Smarts, you compare the popularity of different types of Smarts in the various neighborhoods, your distance from the neighborhoods in which there is demand for Smarts, the amount of various Smarts others want to  sell and the amount of Euro's others bid on new Smarts.

Trade is connected to the four actions in every round.
The Smarts you supply but don't sell are the Smarts you 'eat'. This 'eating' influences your emotional situation. How Relaxed, Dull, Hyper and Heavy you are, is indicated on the Emotionhead display. 
The corresponding actions can be used to improve your Smarttrade. So it's important to work on your emotional state.  Be careful of partial or even total epileptic attacks.

Available tactics include good bidding, good selling and good 'eating'. Doing well in one of these gives opportunities to do well in the other two. But sometimes it is important to 'take it easy'. In many cases the winner at the end doesn't sell in every round and doesn't play a large role in every auction. The best advice: play Smart!

Components:

     A2-sized city board, painted by Annette Wiesman
     real Smarts (actual candies, made of sugar, water soluble)
     real half walnut shells 
     play Euros 
     Emotionhead board

For some reason, most instances of these games come from the right wing (another game in the same class is Capital Punishment, which is much more vitriolic in its political commentary).

The object of this game is to go broke and go on Welfare with the help of government grants and boondoggles.  As the player tokens go around the board, their starting money eventually dwindles to nothing, at which point they no longer receive nor pay out money (ignoring the instructions on most of the board spaces) and exclusively draw from the Welfare fund (a separate pile of money) each turn they go around the board.  The game continues until the Welfare is exhausted, and the winner is then the player who got the most Welfare.

By now the world is for all practical purposes destroyed as the nuclear catastrophe descended with undreamed of disastrous effects on the human race.  The face of the earth is changed and numerous areas around the globe are contaminated and destroyed.  Now mankind must fight against aliens, mutants, delinquents, looters, criminals, disease, radiation, and all the other ills the war has brought.  The main objective now is to survive and to attempt to recreate human society as much as possible.

Holocaust is a fantasy board game in which a hero combats against the horrors of a world devastated by war.  He must fight for his family, find it and save it by leading it out of the devastated city towards the Road to Freedom...

Each player takes the part of Michael.  With the help of the cards he must find everything he needs in the city and then travel along the Road to Freedom and thus leave the city.  An important difference with this game is that to win it, it is not necessary to come out first.  In fact, since the winner is the player with the most points, even the last to come out can be the winner.

Content: 6 lead figures to be painted, 6 player cards, 181 adventure cards, 37 market cards, 6 lead cars to be painted, 1 petrol station and 2 lead repair shops to be painted, 3 dice, 400 markers, paper models to be build (optional), and rules.

The game consists of a deck of 16 cards with various simple images, 16 chips with corresponding images, a bag and a rule sheet.

The cards are placed face-down on a table in a 4x4 grid and the chips are placed in the bag. Players take turns drawing chips out of the bag and attempt to turn over the card with the same image as indicated on the chip. If the image on the card does not match the image on the chip, the card is flipped back over and the chip is returned to the bag. If the images match, the chip is placed on the card.

The winner is the person who places the chip on a card that creates a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally of 4 consecutive cards with chips on them.

Alternatively, all the spaces can be covered with chips, and the goal of the game then becomes to capture the most chips by moving onto them. In addition, there is a die which can be used to give each player one to six moves per turn instead of the standard one.

The Druids start from the Grove, in the centre of the Stone Circle. When a player begins his turn, he must move his druid, firstly, onto one of the 6 stones showing a Pentagram. This is the only space that may be moved to, from the centre area. The player throws both dice. At the beginning of the game each player has only one piece available (his Druid), therefore only one of the dice is used to determine movement. The second dice is unused until such time as the player has other game-pieces available for him to move. The meaning of the symbols on the dice dictate the type of movement allowed.
The space on which a Druid lands also affects further events. After the player has carried out all necessary actions then his turn is over. If a Druid lands on a blank stone then his turn is immediately ended and play passes to the next player.
 Once a player has taken control of two or more pieces then he may apply the dice to their full potential. In this case a player can, for example, move two Spirits or one Spirit and one Druid. Naturally he will choose the optimum moves, considering the symbols on the stones and the location of other game pieces, which each piece can land on.
The player with the most points, overall, wins the game and is proclaimed the new High-Druid.

We have taken come of the best features of cards games like taking tricks, passing cards you don't like to another player and trumping your opponent's clever play.  We've added the great things about dominoes like standing them up in front of you instead of having to hold a deck of cards, stacking them up, knocking them down, and the solid thunk one makes when you play it on the table with authority.  Add a board (well, actually a bag with a board printed on it) to play these games on and make your tiles look better than most other trash and you have Junk Yard and other Trick-Taking Tile-Laying Board Games.

A die has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 pips on one side. All the other sides of the dice are blank. Well, that's not exactly true ... The 2 pip die has a Red Dragon on the face opposite the 2 pips. So, we have 36 sides, but only 7 of the sides have pips and the Red Dragon. Each player starts with 20 points worth of chips. (White = 1 point, Red = 5 points, and Blue = 10 points) Play begins with each player putting 5 points in the pot. On your turn, roll the dice and count the pips. The player then takes that many points out of the pot. If there are not enough points in the pot, then the player adds points to the pot until the pot equals the numbers of pips rolled. There are special payment and rewards for rolling all blanks and for when the Red Dragon is rolled. The first time any player does not have enough points to pay the pot, the set has ended. All remaining players total their points and mark them on the score pad (provided with the game) and a new set is started.

Each playing set has 4 pieces: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. The Alpha piece can be moved only one square, but in any direction (diagonally or laterally). The Beta can be moved either 1 or 2 squares, also in any direction. The Gamma can be moved 1 or 2 squares, laterally only. The Delta can be moved 1 or 2 squares, diagonally only. The players take turns, with each player moving 1 of his or her pieces each turn. Any piece can capture any enemy piece within range by moving into the enemy piece's square and removing the enemy piece. When an Alpha is captured, all its companion pieces are also removed. The surviving Alpha wins. As in many other multi-player games, temporary, unspoken alliances are unavoidable.

The playing components are of unique designs. The playing pieces are hardwood and the roll-up playing board is printed on cloth-backed vinyl. The game is packaged in a nylon drawstring carrying case.

It is inexpensively produced, with a small cardboard board, a 3D cardboard backdrop, and 14 cardboard playing pieces that are inserted into plastic stands.

One player controls the 13 deputies (the posse), the other controls the 1 outlaw.  The object of the game is for the posse player to surround the outlaw such that he can no longer make a valid move.  If that happens, the posse player wins.  The outlaw player tries not to get cornered and wins if he is able to remove enough deputies from the board such that it is impossible for the posse player to win.

Play starts with the outlaw player who must move his outlaw each turn, if possible (if not, he loses the game).  He can move the outlaw to any open orthogonally adjacent space.  He can also jump a deputy piece, like in Checkers, and thereby remove the deputy piece from the board.  The outlaw can make multiple jumps in a single turn, again like in Checkers.

The posse player simply moves one of his deputy pieces into any open orthogonally adjacent space on his turn, trying to create a situation on the board where the outlaw player can not move his piece.

Players may challenge each other if they believe a move has rendered impossible any expression that equals the goal, or if an expression can be formed prematurely. When a challenge is issued, all other players decide which side they want to be on. The side claiming that an expression is possible, has the burden of proof to create such an expression.

Who will become king of the bugs?
There are two paths leading to the coronation of the king of the bugs: the direct way is to crawl across the board. But this only works if your opponent isnt there! Alternatively, one can sort through the bluffing of your opponents and defeat their Marinos.  Note, though, that each error brings that opponent closer to the throne...

The prototype Marieno - Der Knig der Kfer (Marieno, King of the Ladybirds) was first presented by the authors during the 1991 Autorentreffen (Game Designer Meeting) in Gttingen, and it went on to make the top 10 of the prestigious Hippodice Design Competition in 1992. It was published the same year by VSK-Erwachsenenspiele with a much shortened title.

3473,RisiKard!,1996,5.32759,29,2,3,6,20,20,Wargames,Card Game Wargame ,Hand Management,"Risikard is similar to Risk in that players are warring over global territories. However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.

The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.

There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.

At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.

Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.

The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a set). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.

In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.

The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more. Players can be eliminated from the game prior to the game's end.

A simple simulation of an football game. The game has taken 14 years to develop, but it is so simplified you can learn to play it in just one minute.
The equipment consists of two boards, three wooden dice, five wooden pegs, a Bakelite football and a 10 yard marker.
First - Call your play (line plunge, off tackle, end run...)
Second - Throw three dice and the results are always read from low to the high number. 5-4-1 will read 145.
Third - look on the Signal chart to see what happens to the ball.
The player must gain 10 yards in four downs or lose the ball.
When the ball touches or goes over the Goal Line it is a Touchdown.

I have the Game and played the game with my friend Mike about every night doing the football seasons, from 1943-1952.  I feel it was a fantastic game and very simple to play, and there were over 1500 different combinations of plays you could make, which made it a very realistic game.  If you would like a copy of the game, just e-mail me, you would need to suppy about 5 push pins, and a 10 yard marker, and marker for the football.  This game is very rare, as it was made in 1941, but to me still a great game, also you would need 3 dice.

After the assassination of his father, the 26-year old Largo Winch finds himself at the head of a ten billion dollar empire, the W Group.  The Adriatic Commission, a secret organization with apparently unlimited power, does not like this and decides to replace him with a more accommodating figure head.  All blows are allowed: physical elimination, dismantlement of the W Group, hostile take-over, criminal frame-up, kidnapping of his loved ones, etc.

Largo must fight on all fronts, investigate and foil all attempts on him.  He can only count on Simon, his childhood friend, Joy, his seductive bodyguard, Sullivan, his director-general, and Kerensky, an ex-KGB high-tech specialist.

This board game of high adventure will keep all fans of the TV series (itself based on the graphic novels created by Jean Van Hamme and drawn by Philippe Francq) on the edge of their seats.

There are 64 circles corresponding to the 64 squares.  Diagonal moves are made along lines that spiral into and out of the center of the board.  Pieces are set up along the outside of the circle and around the center ring, and play is inward or outward.  The lack of a side edge to what, if uncurled, would be a normal chess board makes for very exciting play.

Vance and Van Hamme have created a very successful graphic novel series entitled XIII --it currently boasts 20 albums (along with 5 albums in it's spin-off series: XIII mystery).  In Tilsit's game XIII : Le Complot based on that police/thriller world, you play each of the 27 key characters in turn.  Your goal is to surmount all obstacles (traps, ambushes, plots) thrown in your way.

The board shows 33 of the albums' key locations; by traveling to each, you assemble a team able to complete a maximum of missions.  Each completed mission awards you investigation points which are necessary for victory.  Of course, there aren't enough missions for every player to win...

The combat encounters will be bloody, and the combined strength of your agents and characters won't be enough --you'll also need to plan your moves and play your cards right...

XIII is an amnesiac whose identity is hotly debated throughout the series.  Various agencies (such as the NSA) have tentatively identified him as various notorious hit men / terrorists / secret agents --but XIII isn't an easy man to catch!

In the first phase of the game players auction for horses, trying to gain those with the best potential form statistic (form). Form influences starting placement and the movement of each horse. This statistic starts low but can be influenced by winning and losing races or through training. The pursuant training phase also allows the opportunity to collect cards that can influence form, aid in races and win money.

Before a race, players select which of their horses they wish to enter. Bets are placed on horses based on their form, starting position and taking into account any cards a player has to influence the race. During the race, players roll a die and compare the result to the horse's form to determine the movement value. Horses can move in and out of lanes based on the positions of other horses and any special cards that are used.

At the end of the race, bets are resolved and a predetermined purse is paid to the top 3 horses. Play proceeds with a second race followed by a third stage of auctioning, training and racing. At the completion of the third race, the player with the most money wins.

Thirty six page rulebook is presented in programmed instruction format to introduce its twelve new scenarios.  Two new 8 X 22 mapboards, and over 1300 counters.

Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10

Mapboard: 6, 7
Scenarios: 21 to 32


(From the back of the box:)

From the Nazi invasion of Poland, through the heroic defense of tiny Finland against the Russian behemoth, the blitzkrieg conquests of Norway and the Low Countries, the Battle of France, and the seizure of Greece the player is struck by the despair of men and nations alike as seen by the soldiers who vainly sacrificed their lives against a more powerful aggressor. This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, Crescendo is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While further refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system. Crescendo is a welcome extension for the Squad Leader enthusiast even before he contemplates a single new counter.

But Crescendo of Doom offers far more than that. Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland. and a host of other minor neutrals including Elite, Line, and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic detail far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks. Experience personally the French frustrations brought on by radioless AFVs and one man turrets. There are no Panthers or T-34s... here it is the Mk III vs. the Char B, Somua, or Matilda.

And Crescendo of Doom need not end in 1942 with our 32nd scenario, The entire British Order of Battle is presented for the whole of WWII enabling fans of the Western Desert, Italian, or Normandy camnpaigns to design their own scenarios for those periods. Crescendo of Doom is more than just a game. When combined with Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! Crescendo is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered Squad Leader and Cross of Iron.

In each game you get: 

     520 double-printed 112 die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that comprised the combatants of the Western Front; 19391942. 
     704 double-printed 5/8 die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the British. French. Polish, and Belgian Armies.

Picture a rounded square with six backgammon points on each side of the square, then add three new points in each corner. The board is reversible, with traditional backgammon on the reverse side.

Regular backgammon rules apply for movement.  The setup is slightly different, since the points farthest away from your home court are used by another player, so those 2 stones start one unit closer to home.

The major change is direction - that all players in a three or four player game are moving clockwise.  Evidently there is no way to set up four players with two running clockwise and two running reverse.

There are variants listed, including team play where two players can have stones resting on the same point.  For two players on this board, each gets two sets of pieces.

This game differs from Quadragammon in that there are four complete sets of stones and the board has additional points printed in the corners.  And its main difference, the all-clockwise movement.

Contents - reversible board (4-fold), 4 sets of stones, 2 dice (!) and rules.

Ranging from the Mideast to Germany, from Afghanistan to Africa, these scenarios provide players with a wide variety of complex and interesting situations. Several of these can be played both as solitaire and as multi-player simulations. The briefing booklet helps bring players up to date on the weapons and aircraft included in this game.

3619,Chain Reaction,1989,6.3,21,2,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"This pure abstract strategy game is a relatively unknown work by Sid Sackson. Similar in some ways to his 1981 Spiel des Jahres winner, Focus, it is available commercially in a German edition, but can be played with materials improvised from a chessboard and checkers.

From the translation: The players take alternate turns of up to five segments, trying to move game pieces from their home squares over the opposing goal line, in order to score points. After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to nuclear chain reactions, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.

The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan. In 1990 it was published by Hexagames in their Exklusiv series, and later (1993?) by Abacus in their very similar Abacus wood box series.

Some of the tile functions include Secret Passages (can move between them as if adjacent), the Escape passage (move your hero to it immediately after laying it down), Drakon's Bargain (buy a tile from the board into your hand), Base Structure (tiles attached to it cannot be altered), Small Chamber (blocks movement when occupied), Void (miss next turn, reappear anywhere on board turn after that), Tornado (must move 4 chambers on next move), and Summon Drakon (places the Drakon token on an empty chamber, subsequent landings allow you to move it up to 3 chambers; Drakon sends heroes back to the start less 1 gold.)

				
					version compatibility

Although the package says that this expansion cannot be used with the first printing of the game (with a red dragon on the cover) and can only be combined with the second printing (with a green dragon on the cover), using it with the first printing is not that big of a problem.  The only difficulty is that the backs of the tiles will have different pictures, and of minor note is that the newer tiles are a little thicker than the old ones.

Note that the expansion will not work with the newer Drakon (third edition) because it has larger tiles (measuring 2.5 by 2.5 inches), and the 3rd Edition doesn't really need it since it already includes some of the expansion tiles.

There is a also a variant for older children and adults that allows players to find matches solely to remove frog tiles form the game and make it impossible for others to complete their board.

This is a good game and one that adults will like to play with children in the same way as Zapp Zerapp or Zicke Zacke Hhnerkacke.

The Civil War Battle Game represents a major departure from conventional wargame design. There are no complicated rules to memorize; no plethora of numbers, tables and charts to study, analyze and confuse the players. Instead, players must concentrate their energies on implementing the sound military principles of maneuver and attack to defeat their opponent. Emphasis is placed on decision making ability and on the players' skill in properly coordinating the actions of their various units. There are no tricks to be learned in this game.

SQUARES - The Civil War Battle Game contains no luck or chance element s; no dice, no spinners, no chance cards. All results are based purely on the individual player's decisions made throughout the course of the game. Players will win or lose based on their ability to outwit their opponent. You won't get lucky in this game; unless your opponent makes a mistake.......(first).

World Powers battle for control of the world using forces that include modern day tactical and nuclear weapons.  But watch out!  Launch too many missiles and the Earth is plunged into a dark and cold Nuclear Winter!...  No one wins.

Exciting strategies with thought-provoking results.

Includes beginner's rules (Easy to Play) and Advanced rules which include such variations as - EMP Effect and a Doomsday Time Limit.

Players command conventional armies, ocean fleets, intra and inter-continental weapons to make combinations of land, sea and airborne attacks.  Players attempt to occupy the most territories and control the World's population, resources and technology.

However, launching NUKES destroys territories thereby reducing the relative value of the victory.  Could you survive?  Would you want to?

(From the writer)  This game is like playing risk with nuclear weapons.  Once one player goes nuclear, it's a MAD game (mutual assured destruction).  The real value of the game is in showing that nobody wins in a nuclear exchange.  Currently OOP as far as I know.

By moving their tokens onto criminals, the player engages them in battle, which is resolved by again using the spinner.  If victorious, the player takes (captures) the criminal's disc into his or her possession.

The game ends when all criminals have been captured.  The players score the criminals they have captured (different points for the 6 types of criminals in the game).  The one with the highest points wins the game.

3739,Bot,2001,6.21875,16,2,2,2,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Fighting ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenHand Management,"A relaunch of a late 70s release, Bot is a game in which each of the two players command a serpent abstractly represented as a line of pawns occupying successive hexes in the gameboard. Players organize and play their hand of cards to direct their serpents' linear movement across the board. To each hexside corresponds a color; each card has a color and a number. Thus, a Yellow-3 card allows a player to move his serpent three hexes in the Yellow direction. Once a serpent successfully reaches (hits) the opposing serpent, it eats and removes two of the attacked serpent's pawns from the game. The same cannibalistic result is achieved if you successfully drive your serpent towards the enemy home base. Serpents may defend by biting their own tail, forming an impregnable ring, or by using the board's underground tunnel for a quick escape. First player to reduce the enemy serpent to nothingness is the winner. The name Bot is a homophone for bote, a Brazilian Portuguese noun meaning serpent strike.

The Game of Define and Conquer

Needing just one more ring to win, you are contemplating the best tactic to invade that last territory.  Just then a juicy prize happens by  an opponent's pawn carrying the ring you need.  It's a complex and delicate choice.  At times this rival has seemed capable of besting Webster in a war of words, and an ambush would surely bring retaliation.  On the other hand, your strategically saved Move Card just might help...

Staged on a battlefield of colorful, intertwining paths, Captivation is an engaging contest of word power and shrewd strategies.  Players invade neighboring territories seeking to capture prized rings through a display of vocabulary finesse.  The words will fly and the best laid plans fail on the precarious, fun-filled journey home.

The Game of Define
With an emphasis on practical but challenging words, the Captivation questions allow players to test, show off, and maybe even improve their vocabularies.
The questions are carefully crafted to be deceptive, thought-provoking, subtly amusing, and, on occasion, outrageously funny.

...and The Game of Conquer
But this is not strictly a word game.  Even the finest definer must constantly re-evaluate the ever-changing strategic situation.  Plotting the best course, out-maneuvering opponents, deftly utilizing Move Cards, and a little luck are equally important.  The mission is simple, but the path to victory spans a perilous field of shifting fortunes, startling surprises, and captivating fun.

The game consists of a board, 3 runner pieces per player, 4 hunter pieces per player, a card identifying each of the 6 runners, two dice and a set of rules.

After all the pieces are in place, the game commences with the hidden selection of each player's favourite runner. This is done by placing the card representing this runner face-down but in an open location. Runners are distinguished by the colours of their sombreros. Rolling the dice, the players move either their runners or hunters around the multiple paths on the board. Taking care of special board spaces and certain limitations on movement, each player will be moving runners towards the end goal while trying to capture an opponent's runners with his/her hunters. When a hunter captures a runner, the player that was attacked reveals the hidden runner card. If the favourite was captured, the game ends. If not, a new favourite is secretly selected and the hunter must return to the start.

The main goal is either to stop the opponent's favourite runner or to make it to the end with your own favourite.

The game ends when one of the forces is eliminated or a set period of time passes (40 turns). With over 1000 pawns, each representing 30 cavalry or 80 men, it attempts to provide a clear sense of the carnage on the battlefield. The historic battle faced an estimated 50,000 romans against 40,000 Carthaginians.

The game map is scaled at 1 square for each 25 meters, and each turn of the game equals 15 minutes of battle. During each turn the romans go first, then the Carthaginians, and the turns are broken into phases: movement, defensive placement, offensive placement, confrontation, recovery.

Units are represented by two values, strength and movement.  Movement indicates the number of spaces that a unit can advance each turn if not engaged in combat. Strength is used in battle to determine combat resolution, in combination with die rolls.

3784,Die Schätze des Ali Baba,1999,3.5,2,0,2,5,60,60,,Arabian Novel-based ,,"The Treasures of Ali  Baba

extrapolated from a review done by Kevin Whitmore

At the beginning of the game each player starts with a pawn in the bottom corner of the board. At the opposite corner of the board is the entrance to the cave. Every turn each player rolls a D6 to move. Players must move their pawns in a clockwise direction along the edge of the board upon a narrow track. At the left-hand corner is a space marked Wste (Desert). Each pawn must stop there. To leave the desert a player must roll an odd number. Upon reaching the far corner players must pause on the corner before opening the mountain.

The heart of the game happens within the cave. The cave is large, dominating the game mat. Up to 40 square cards can be placed face down, one per space, within the cave. This number will be reduced if the optional obstacles and tea light are used. The cards show the same back, depicting a vase. When a pawn ends its move on a vase the active player may inspect it, and claim the treasure shown. In addition, the player rolls a die to see if they break the vase. If not, they replace the treasure card with a blank card showing the same vase on the back. In this way the game board becomes depleted of treasures and filled up with worthless empty vases, or voids where vases were broken.

Complicating the players lives is the band of 40 thieves. Really it is just the black pawn, but he travels the board seeking to prevent the players from absconding with the treasures. Combat slightly favors the black pawn, encouraging all the players to give him a wide berth.

As players collect more treasures, they become encumbered, and forfeit movement points as their load increases. This allows the black pawn to possibly catch a players pawn. However, some of the treasure cards are empty backpacks and sacks, allowing a pawn to carry more treasure before becoming encumbered. Further, the black pawn is slow, rolling a special die with a top value of four.

Once a pawn has escaped from the cave, he must continue clockwise upon the track along the edge of the board. At the right-hand corner is a space marked BAGHDAD. Each pawn must stop in Baghdad, and may only leave on the roll of an even number. Should the pawn fail to leave, one of its hard-earned treasures will be lost. Staying in Baghdad is expensive! Eventually the pawn will escape Baghdad, and travel back to the starting corner.

To win the game the player must have more treasures than any other player, and they must also have more treasures than what remains within the cave.

3792,Countermoves Generic Microgame Engine,2001,3,1,0,2,2,20,20,Abstract Wargames,Abstract Strategy Dice Game System Miniatures Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"The CGME Core Rules are the basic building blocks that could be used to make a Microgame. Think of them as atoms. With just these core rules you will not be able to play much. What you can do with them though is build up Gameworlds that take the CGME Core Rules and fill in the details of the game setting you want to play.

The Gameworlds are the source documents that will add the detail to the Core Rule's atomic structure. They will describe things like a worlds terrain, the units available, their strengths and weaknesses, the climate, special rules that modify combat resolution, new rules that cover things like horse back ridding, vector space ship movement, and just how to handle a Vogon star destroyer that has wandered into your Medieval Fantasy realm.

By building off the same Core Rules and by using the Gameworlds you have created, or have been created by others, you can then build up Gamesets to cover the specific events to play out. For example, by using the CGME Core Rules coupled with the CGME Space Gameworld you could build a Gameset to play interstellar battles, trade wars across colonial star systems, early 1970's Soviet vs. US orbital conflicts, and many more.

If a Gameworld does not cover all the details you need to play out your event, you are free to haul off and add in what you need, modify what is there and hopefully make it available so others can use it.

CGME is freely available in Volume 1 Issue 1 of Countermoves

3797,Grade Up to Elite Cow,1986,4.57143,7,2,2,4,60,60,,Animals Dice Educational Farming ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and MoveTrading,"A promotional/educational game of skill and chance for Dairy Farmers made by Waddingtons of behalf of The British Friesian Cattle Society of Great Britain and Ireland as a fundraising exercise in which proceeds from the game went to the Y.M.A (Young Members Association) of the said Society.

Players attempt to gradually grade up their mixed non-pedigree and pedigree dairy herd to achieve pedigree status in just three generations. The mechanism for doing so involves following the real life process of getting female offspring from an animal that is considered typical of the breed and showing no obvious signs of cross breeding (and thus qualified to be entered in the A Section of the Supplementary Register of the Herd Book maintained by the Society as ASR). These female offspring would be qualified to be entered in the B Section of the Supplementary Register as BSR cows, and their pure bred offspring would in turn qualify as CSR animals. The daughters of CSR animals can then be registered in the Herd Book proper and become full pedigree cows.

Full pedigree animals that achieve certain standards of milk and butterfat production then can be entered into the Register of Merit (can carry the suffix RM) and an RM cow that has calved at least three times, had two yearly yields entered in the RM and has at least 76 point in Type Classification (out of 100 in a system of grading desired breed characteristics) in turn qualifies as an RMX standard cow (X for Excellent).

RMX cows who achieve a lifetime milk yield of at least 50 long tonnes and have scored at least 85 point in Type Classification finally qualify to grade up to Elite Cow.

The object in simplified game terms is to be the first player to grade up at least 4 cows (out of a starting 6) to that Elite Cow status and thus win the game.

The game was inspired by the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal and the design is a satire of that and all other scandals in history.  The cards are divided into categories, each representing elements of a good public scandal:  the Target, the Trigger, the Transgression, the Trumpeters (media), the Tidbits, and the Testimonials.

Players take turns adding a card to the growing scandal.  Only one target, trigger, and transgression may be in play at any given time, and each is required for a complete scandal, but multiple cards from other categories may be added freely.  When the three required elements are present, a player may trigger a scoring round by playing one of two It's History! cards.  Scandals are thus generated until one player reaches a target total score.

The 54 cards are each marked with standard playing card rank and suit (to allow use for traditional card games), and many sport photos of nude or scantily clad women (the box carries a not for sale to minors under 18 warning).  As part of the marketing, randomly 1 in 12 decks were given an extra card signed by Nina Hartley.

Players must build up their financial portfolio by risking money on long or short selling, playing the variations in the market, using margins and generally speculating. Players roll and move around a Monopoly-type board, with landing spaces and card draws giving various options. The board features an outer track where stocks can generally be purchased, and an inner criss-cross track where gambles and takeovers predominate. Purchasing of stock is unlike standard Monopoly exclusivity: when landing on a square, the active player may purchase up to 40% of available stock, and then all other players may also purchase stock. Disclosure rules generally limit ownership levels except for takeover situations. Typical brokerage mechanisms such as longs, shorts, margin calls, warrants, Futures, dividends, etc. are incorporated into the game.

The game comes with three difficulty levels, with the goal of the full-difficulty-version involving acquisition of shares in every company in one of the four market groups and absolute majority of one of the companies in that group.

This game was endorsed by the Toronto Stock Exchange.

By paying the costs in the equation cards, in order, you produce whatever the output card indicates.

This alone would be a little like solitaire, so enter the challenge you can make once per turn. Challenge anyone for up to three resources, and then each bid a secret amount more. Whoever has more wins everything, unless they overbid by more than three in which case the lower bid wins! This allows for player interaction, although not a high degree of such.

The game is played out in a repeating sequence of play.  Players first secretly plot the heading and reveal them simultaneously.  They then use the Navigation Wheels, a custom 3-layer disc, to resolve the effects of their movement.  By rotating the layers of the wheel in accordance with their crafts' headings, the players learn which of their weapons can fire at their opponents.  They then roll dice and consult a table to determine the effects of their weapon fire, recording damage on their cards.

The game ends when a player has inflicted 10 points of damage on their opponent's starfighter.  A solo game variant is available, dictating the opponent's actions by dice rolls.

This game is the precursor to Mad Gab. The basic premise is that you are given a string of words that are meaningless, but sound like another phrase or title. Ache Leans Late = A Clean Slate.

In this version, 2 to 4 teams compete to collect cards while advancing toward the center of a board. On a team's turn, one player gives clues for the words in a puzzle (e.g. What you do when you're sore -- ache). That player's partners guess the words, and then try to figure out the puzzle. If the timer runs out before they've solved it, then the other team(s) can steal the card. Each card is worth from 3 to 7 points.

When one team is in the middle, they can play for double points on their turn; however, if they lose the card, they're sent back a few squares, and the team that gets the puzzle gets the double points.

The game ends when all teams are in the middle. Whoever has scored the most points wins.

Although  the game superficially resembles Monopoly, instead of becoming the richest player by bankrupting everyone else, the goal is to be the first player to raise enough money to fly south, i.e. somewhere in Latin or South America.
This is accomplished by carrying out the usual Mafia activities during the Prohibition Era: bootlegging, racketeering, narcotics smuggling, robbery, bookmaking and Al Capone's favorite.. income tax evasion. Obstacles to achieving your goals include gun battles with other mobsters (players), police chases when robberies go wrong, and stints in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds, or being sent up the river to the Big House.
To aid you in your quest, you hire cronies to carry out your bidding, and gain influence through power tokens. 
These can be used to bribe city officials when you end up in court. You can also run for Mayor, which increases your influence even more.
While all of this sounds very serious, the game is actually quite humorous, with everything being done in Tom Wham's inimitable cartoon art style. For 2-6 gangsters.

3948,Jolly Roger,1979,4.625,8,0,2,6,60,60,,Dice Fantasy Nautical Pirates ,Dice RollingPick-up and Deliver,"From the Italian company International Team comes this fairly simple game of piracy on the high seas.

On a map that can only be considered a fantasy world you sail your galleon around the outer islands picking up treasure chests in the hope of delivering the treasures to his island in the middle of the board.

Movement is handled by way of a wind disk. Every 3 turns this disk turns and the wind will be coming from a new direction. A ship always moves in a straight line that can be at a diagonal. If it is sailing in the direction of the wind it must move 4 spaces. If in a diagonal with the wind it must move 5 spaces. If perpendicular to the wind movement is 3 spaces. If diagonal against the wind movement is 2 spaces and if against the wind 1 space. The wind rotates in a rigid sequence so you can always plan what your ship will be doing. If a ship runs onto land it is sunk. A ship can stop short of its full movement if it is in a harbor square of which each island has one. On the outer islands this is where a galleon picks up treasures and each may carry up to 3. The board wraps around on itself so if a ship sails off an edge it reappears on the opposite side of the board.

There are 6 dark areas on the seas that can become storms. The start player rolls 2 die at the beginning of his turn and puts a marker on the corresponding areas. Ships cannot enter these and ships that are in these areas cannot move.

Each player also has a frigate. Frigates attempt to pass over another ship, regardless of the type, which will sink it. A sunken ship will always reappear at that players island at the start of his next turn. Frigates may not dock at harbors so they cannot end their movement short when passing over one. Ships sunk have their treasures returned to the bank.

You play until a player has collected an agreed to amount of treasures. The rules suggest 8 to 20.

The rules take up 3 small pages of which half the page is rules in another language. There are also 4 illustrations in the rules so you end up with about 1 page of rules. Some things are very vague though. How the Disk of Winds is used is not very clear. Here logic can get you through. The islands in the center are not marked as belonging to anyone so I have always had each player put a treasure on one to claim it. We have also played that the islands belong to no one player and you just need to get you treasures to an island. This makes it a lot easier to dock and drop off treasures.

Each player or team puts their playing marker at the center of the board, and their 4 scoring markers on the 0 at the start of each of the 4 scoring scrolls. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far you may move on the board, moving in any direction they choose (but they may not visit the same space twice in a turn). The spaces on the board are color coded to each of the 4 categories of questions, and are marked with a number (10, 7, 4, and 1) that corresponds to the difficulty of the clue. Each card has 4 clues on it, descending in value (10, 7, 4, and 1). Players may hear the clues in descending value until they reach the minimum value indicated on their space on the board -- if they can successfully answer at a higher point clue value, they will receive the higher points.

An alternate form of scoring is based on stealing points from the opponents by landing on a space on the board without a number. When this happens, the player competes head-to-head with the person that has scored the most points on that category's scoring scroll.

Each nugget represents one of six metals. Each player, in turn, places one, two or three nuggets on the gameboard. The nuggets placed must match each other, however. After placement of the nuggets, the player may purchase up to two shares of stock of the mines represented by the nuggets on the gameboard. The player then ends the turn by replacing the nuggets played with nuggets from the bag. Every subsequent turn has each player beginning the turn by collecting profit based on the number of shares owned and the size of each mine and rarity of the metal therein.

The game ends when the gameboard is filled. All players cash out the value of their stocks and the player with the most money is declared the victor.

3963,Tryce,1969,5.76923,13,1.6667,3,6,10,10,,Card Game ,Set Collection,"The game consists of two standard card decks including the jokers from each deck. In addition to the standard numbers and suits the cards also contain a letter of the alphabet.

The players are attempting to create runs, groups and words. A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.

Each player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.

Players gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends. The player with the highest total after all seven rounds is the winner.

An interesting variation of Rummy, Tryce adds an element of strategy to that game.

Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series.  It was also released in a butterbox or butterdish version.

Booster sets are also available.

Each player selects a character card secretly before the beginning of the game, which will affect which action pieces that the player will be most effective with, determines the minimum and maximum number of action pieces that the player must play with, and describes any special abilities of the character. Next, each player chooses which action pieces they will play with from their collection, subject to the limits of the character card. Finally, each player contributes an agreed-upon number of hexes (rooms) to the game in their own stack.

Gameplay consists of drawing/discarding action pieces,  playing any number of free action pieces, taking one action (such as moving, exploring by adding a new hex to the board and resolving the occurrence on the hex, playing an action piece, attacking another player/creature, or exiting the crypt).

The goal is to be the first player to find your key in the action piece deck, find and place your exit tile, and successfully exit the crypt complex.

The only human characters in the game are the Wizards themselves and the greatest warriors; ordinary mortals stay out of the way when dragons battle with demons and giants. The Wizards attempt to rally neutral beings to their cause, and to hamper their opponent's efforts by moving the very terrain itself. The landscape is enchanted, and its mountains and forests are subject to powerful spells. With these spells, the magic portals called Gates, and his own forces, each Wizard hopes to give his rivals their death blows. The winner is the last Wizard left in the land.

Early November Soviets attacks blew holes in the thin German defenses, resulting in the liberation of Kiev and the pursuit to Korosten and Zhitomir.  A massive German riposte led by the XLVIII Panzerkorps stuck the Soviet flank and rolled back some of the initial Soviet Gains.  In December, additional German efforts pushed in the Soviet forces around Korosten.  Heavy Soviet reinforcements (undetected by the Germans) enabled the Soviet to return to the offensive on Christmas Eve and drive the Germans back from Kiev once and for all.

4018,Pentagon Games,1987,4.83333,12,1,1,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Book Negotiation ,Roll / Spin and Move,"A book containing three games:


Pentagon

Pentagon is not a simulation in the formal sense of the word. The events in the game are intended to be illustrative and the decisions fictitious, woven from the progress of play. But by giving the players incentives both to compete and to cooperate, the game does simulate bureaucratic politics. And the content of bureaucratic politics is similar in tone and substance to real debates over military budgets. Pentagon shows how political factors influence the shape of budgets before the bureaucracy even gets down to decisions on weapons procurement and their merits.


The RD Game: Congressional Chutes and Ladders

The RD Game is designed as a solitaire game. It is based on a decision-tree mechanism that leads the player through a set of alternative developments. This type of approach is sometimes called a scripted role model because the main emphasis is on broad decision choices rather than narrow selection of tactics. Given the broad choice, the decision tree itself generates much of the action, unlike a two-player or multi-player game in which action flows from the decisions of each of the players.


The Last Days of Saigon

An introductory level wargame.  The goal of each player is to destroy the other player's forces, so the game does not follow the historical values.  The map is pretty basic, moderately large scale, 3-color with just basic terrain. Units are mostly Brigade-level units with a few regimental and batallion units thrown in. There is a mostly abstract representation of air, and naval units. [Note: This game was also published as 'Last Days At Saigon' in 'Bridge' magazine, Volume 4 #1 (11/75) bound-in, with bw components, as part of a 'Vietnam in Retrospect' issue.]

4026,Udder Madness,2000,3.59091,11,0,2,4,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Humor ,Tile Placement,"A lighthearted cow-tipping game in which aliens are trying to tip cows for bragging rights.



In the first part of the game, players place their cows. 
On an 8x8 grid (3 players) or 9x9 grid (2 or 4 players), players take turns placing 12 cow chits of their color, 1 at a time and 1 per cell, inside the fence, which is a 1-cell perimeter. When placing cows, players try to achieve Cow Lock, which is two identically-colored orthogonally adjacent cows. Four cows in a square is called a Bovine Doom Block. Next, each player places their alien chit on the center square of their edge of the board (on the grid, but outside the fence). They take turns moving the alien up to 3 spaces, and then they may choose to tip cows. Tipping starts from the alien and stops at a Cow Lock -- the alien cannot tip a cow directly into a cow of the same color. The player then collects all tipped cows.

To determine individual scores, each player tallies their cows, subtracting the number of cows of their color from the remaining cows. High score wins.

In the 2-player game, each player uses a single alien marker as normal, but chooses and places cows of 2 colors. Cow Lock and Bovine Doom Block can still only be achieved with cows of the same color.


From the packaging:
In Udder Madness you are an alien engaged in a contest with your alien pals to see who can tip the most cows of your opponents while tipping as few of your own as possible.

Why an alien, you ask? Well there are a couple of reasons.

One reason is that by now, any alien visitors we may have must surely have grown bored with abducting people and examining their nether-regions. So with nether-regions out, and crop circles quickly becoming pass, they're going to need some new mystifying activity... Why not this?

The second reason is that we at Placebo Press could not possibly believe that an actual human being, no matter how depraved or intoxicated, would participate in such an activity outside of the confines of a harmless board game? Hence it must be aliens. I don't think that our logic is flawed here.

Lost in the ancient Celtic migration across Europe, this game was played between the clan chieftains to resolve disputes peacefully rather than resort to a costly and bloody war. It was played on a swatch of ornamental cloth familiar to this day as a plaid. Instead of stones used in the traditional game, this variation presented here uses as the playing pieces.

To win at Breacan - and thus resolve the dispute in your favor, you must be the first to weave a path from one side of the Breacan to the opposite side.

Placing the dice
On your turn, place two of your four rolled dice. After your turn has ended, two more dice will be automatically rolled to replace the two you rolled.

Dice can be placed in two ways:
1. They can be placed on a square of your own color (e.g. red on red) when that square has no vertical or horizontal neighbors.
2. They can be placed on any square as long as each adjacent (horizontally or vertically) neighboring die of your color is either one higher or one lower than the die being placed. Note: 6 can be placed next to a 1 and 1 next to a 6.

Winning
The first player to complete a path from top to bottom or from side to side is the winner.

4030,Metis,2001,8.125,4,0,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area Movement,"[For more information and to play online visit www.allumbra.com]

Metis is a pure strategy game in which you guide your Priests in exchanging power with each other to ultimately wrest control of your opponents Temple of Metis.

Your Priests all have varying degrees of power. Those with greater power can make sweeping movements greatly altering the course of the struggle. Lesser Priests, while more limited in might, are able to move more freely.

Movement

A piece can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally exactly the number of spaces as the value currently on the die. After, you move, transfer power with the pieces you jumped (see below).

Landing on Pieces: You may land on a piece (yours or your opponents) only if your piece has a higher value than the one it is landing on. The piece that you land on is destroyed. The capturing piece gains +1 power.

Power Transfer

As pieces move over one another, they exchange power. You give (1) power from your moving piece to each of your own pieces that you jump. Your piece takes (1) power from each enemy piece it passes over.

Underpowered and Overpowered Pieces: During movement, if a piece falls below (1) power, it is has become underpowered and is removed from the board. Likewise, if a piece gains more than (6) power, it has become overpowered and is removed from the board.

Winning

There are two possible ways to win Metis.

1. Occupy seats in your opponents Temple of Metis. There are two areas in each players temple: The inner chamber (darker) and the outer chamber (lighter). Occupying a seat in the inner chamber is worth 2 occupation points. occupying a seat in the outer chamber is worth 1 occupation point. You must hold 8 occupation points to win the game.

2. Destroy opponents pieces until she has three or less (making the above goal impossible for your opponent).

4033,Rosetta,1974,4.5,2,0,1,4,20,20,,Puzzle ,Tile Placement,"Rosetta is a tile laying game where players are trying to match the designs on the tiles to form a complete picture.
The two main game types are co-op in that players are all working together to complete the design. It can be thought of as a puzzle, with square pieces, that has multiple solutions.

On one side of the tiles, the Rosetta, 1-3 players work together to make a 6x6 square picture. When complete, the picture shows different coloured flowers, each made up of two corresponding square pieces. You may choose to use the 4 joker tiles as wild cards.

On the other side, Puncola, you are creating a 6x6 square picture by matching the edges of the tiles with a similar pattern on an adjacent tile. At the corners of certain tiles is a 1/4 circle that is paired with 3 other tiles to form a complete circle.

Domino-Puncola is an alternate version of the game that adds competition. Each player picks 5 tiles at random and, in turn, tries to match an edge of the Puncola side to a tile on the table. If that person cannot place his/her tile, he/she draws a new one. The first person to place all of his/her tiles is the winner.

Teams are fictional and can be built based on fixed points or amount of money the team has. Players are of three average, good, exceptional and cost different amounts of money to hire. 
Money can either be a fixed amount in pick up games, or using the advanced economy rules, can be obtained from running concessions and selling broadcasting rights.

The dual-fold, multi-color game board folds for easy storage. Each comes with three teams of ten sculptured ABS figurines, each with individually stenciled numbers. A designated hitter is included on each team. Since the whole family can play BIG BUCKS BASEBALL, one set of figurines is female.

The game also includes 3 special challenging dice, 32 player upgrade snap rings, 12 ball/strike markers, 10 concession/broadcast replicas, 2 miniature game baseballs, 90 pieces of currency, 32 special event cards, 2 reproducible score sheets, and a complete instruction booklet and quick start guide. All of this is packaged in a compact 10-inch by 10-inch durable game box.

The game uses a unique system of roulette type spinner based on batter and pitcher's experience (3 levels) to determine the outcome of each pitch. Once a pitch is hit the defensive team can still field the ball using a system of color coded dice. Careful through, failing the fielding roll will increase the effectiveness of the hit (error). Also there are event cards such as injuries and automatic player upgrades (having a good night) which influence the game randomly.

[From the game manual]
Beyond the icy seas of Kislev and the Sea of Claws lies the dark Realm of Chaos. It is here that resides a greater danger than any posed by the mortal enemies of the nations of the Known World. Within the Chaos Wastes nature itself has become corrupted and the very earth rebels against what it has become; in this wild and dangerous place the trees moan in eldritch voices and the rocks scream their hate at a dark and uncaring sky.

The seas of this inhuman realm are the most dangerous and deadly waters of the Known World.

4136,Shadow Wars,2001,7.5,8,0,2,4,120,120,Wargames,Fantasy Wargame ,Modular BoardVariable Player Powers,"Shadow Wars is a fantasy strategy board game where each player chooses one of the four rulers within the game: Human, Dwarf, Elf or Dark Elf. These rulers have different advantages, disadvantages and play styles. Some rulers have mighty soldiers and defenses but are weaker in magic. Where as, other rulers are extremely powerful when it comes to magic but have weaker and fewer soldiers than the other rulers. Players must learn how to best use their ruler and play against the other three vastly different: Rulers, Units, Creatures, Magic, Buildings and Strategies. A full description and artwork can be found at: http://www.shadowwars.net

Each player starts with a Capital, two towns and one special building. From these locations the players can slowly build up their resources to obtain additional Towns, Cities and special buildings. Each new building will give that player an additional advantage, but also takes resources to build. A few examples of these buildings are: Armory, Mine, Mage Tower, Blood Forge, Dark Library  Cathedral. As each individual player expands their empire they can hire vast armies, summon powerful creatures  conquer new lands. With all of the various units and buildings each game is unique and, most of all, fun. The last player with a Capital left standing is the King of Syrrith!

4148,Mehen,3000,5.34615,13,1,2,6,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Racing ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"In the 1920s, anthropologists, explorers and adventurers found a curious spiral-tracked game being played by the Baggara Arabs of the Sudan Li'b el Merafib, The Hyena Game.  In all essential details the Hyena Game seems to have been identical to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (The Game of the Coiled One).  The board's shape suggests it may be a distant ancestor of the Game of Goose but the mechanics are so different that this is probably a coincidence.

It was played on a spiraling track, employed stick dice (throwing sticks) of precisely the kind known from Archaic Egyptian contexts, and had two types of pieces, one representing a predatory animal.  The only difference would seem to be that the ancient Egyptians allotted six counters to each player rather than only one.  The Cretan Phaistos Disc may have been a Mehen board, but that remains speculation.

Mehen is the only multi-player ancient Egyptian board game known, the others (Senet, Aseb, Hounds  Jackals, etc.) being all two-player games.  The main function of the serpent-shaped Egyptian god Mehen was to protect the sun-god Ra from his enemies by coiling around him.  In the Old Kingdom, the race-game Mehen took the name and shape of the god: a coiled serpent with the gaming spaces on its back.  As bodyguard, Mehen symbolises the sun-god's immediate neighborhood for the deceased.  The deceased walks towards Ra on the back of the serpent-god.

By the early Middle Kingdom, the cuts used on the snake's back of the Mehen board to separate the playing spaces were thought to kill the snake which would have been a very threatening and evil thing.  Mehens role was essential, for if Ra were not protected from his enemies, he might not rise in the morning, which would result in the cessation of all life.  In Egyptian belief, life applied not only to the living but also to the dead, who were believed to travel with the sun and to rise, reborn, with him at dawn.  From that time forth, the game apparently ceased to be played, possibly banned and forbidden.

The charm of Carmel-by-the-Sea, a storybook village of sun-dappled forests and jewel-like beaches has been captured by this exciting new board game.  What every visitor remembers fondly and residents cherish has been re-created on a 30 x 30 game board of Carmel streets and buildings nestled among the pines.  Players draw illustrated cards with the names of businesses where they must go to make specific purchases.  They map a direct course, roll the dice and drive through Carmel Proper to the businesses before continuing on to the site where the last gingerbread-style home, dubbed Carmel Charmer by the residents, will be auctioned off.  The highest bidder wins.  However, shopping in Carmel Proper is full of pitfalls.  No parking spaces can be found.  Fines are levied for double parking and pedestrians fill the streets, blocking the players route.  A chance card may send a player close to his goal or on a detour through the beautiful 17 Mile Drive.  A wary player who catches an opponent breaking any traffic rule receives a bonus of $1000 from the violator.  Car theft is $5000.

Carmel Proper is a game of distinction.  The board itself is an artistic rendering that depicts the tiny city with accuracy.  The movers are handcrafted wooden cars.  The money, beautifully printed on real parchment paper, increases the quality of the gameand exquisite addition to any home.

From the back of the box:
ENDANGERED SPECIES is a game the entire family will enjoy.  It introduces players to the largest animal that ever lived, the fastest four-legged animal in the world, a huge bird of prey with a ten-foot wingspan, the most powerful ape, the fiercest carnivore in the Americas, and many other fascinating creatures now facing extinction.  Player try to save these animals by setting up Preserves to protect their natural habitats, and then establishing programs to protect them from hunting, capture for zoos, chemical pollution, and commercial exploitation.  To win, a player must save five species from one geographic area.  Unexpected gains and setbacks make the game unpredictable, and action cards held by each player permit a wide variety of strategic moves and counter moves.  No two games are ever the same.

4169,Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game,1998,5.51765,17,0,4,8,60,60,,Card Game Fantasy ,,"The Deathtrap Dungeon card game came with some copies of the PC version of the Deathtrap Dungeon computer game by EIDOS. The cards themselves feature a whole host of nasties, including Skeletons, Orcs and Bloodbeasts. The game is actually based on an ancient Chinese card game called Zheng Shang Yu.

The goal of Deathtrap Dungeon is to 'kill' all the monsters by discarding cards, all of which have a creature on them. The quicker you do it the better. All the cards are dealt out and the player who gets the 'Exploding Pig' starts by discarding the Pig and another card.

Players arrange their cards into sets, e.g. Orcs, Skeletons, Bloodbeasts etc, and the first player puts down any number of cards from the same set, face up. The next player can then play if they can put down the same number of cards, but with a higher value. Therefore Four Skeletons, which are worth 3 each, could be followed by Four Warriors, which are worth 5 each. If a player cannot do this, they pass and play moves on to the next player.

The winner of the hand is the last player to put down the set with the highest value. This person then starts the next round. A note is made of the order the players finish in, and they are then ranked:

Winner = The Big Hero! 
2nd place = The Hero 
2nd to last place = The Wimp 
Last place = The Total Wimp!

The cards are shuffled and re-dealt for the second round, but before the game begins again, The Total Wimp must hand over their 2 highest cards to The Big Hero and the Big Hero gives back any two of their cards. This also happens with The Wimp and The Hero. The game continue until 4 rounds have been played.

There are also Special cards in the deck. Also included are Chaindog and Red Lotus, two player characters from the computer game, and can be used to add to any set, however played on their own they have a value of 0. The Killing Machine, which can be played on its own at any time, stops a hand, the player that used it begins the next hand.

Since you eat your opponent's conquered armies, and it is very unlikely that you will eat your own armies, it is suggested you order an ingredient that others hate.  This will ensure that others will think twice about attacking you.

Your armies (ingredients) move from land (slice) to land waging war against the opponent's armies.  Last man standing wins.

The game is very simple but does come with optional rules to add difficulty, realism, and flavour (sorry).

Also includes rules for Grubb Chess, using a chess board and various hot peppers; Galactic Gluttons, using pizza, dice, paper, plates, and a ruler (Apparently you said between the lands); and Gulf War, with rules sadly omitted because the designers decided that the average gamer could not afford to fill a bathtub with chili-con-carne.

The underlying goals were to produce a game that was:
1. As elegant and direct as Chess. 
2. Included the intricacies and intrigue of governmental, business, military and geo-political relations.

Like Chess, HexiMerosTM consists of players alternately moving playing pieces with the object of winning.  Like the strategy games, HexiMerosTM provides opportunities for alliances, betrayals, making friends and enemies.  Unlike Chess, a Sovereign may be captured and removed from the board.  Unlike the strategy games, everything that happens around the play area and away from the play area is part of the game.

The game of HexiMerosTM is played between six opponents who move their pieces alternately on a hexagonal board.  The player with the Silver pieces commences the game. A player is said to have the Move when he is in possession of the Token.  The object of the game is to be the last Sovereign on the board.  The players do this by placing other opponents Sovereigns under attack, in such a way that the opponent Sovereign may be captured by himself or any other player.  This is repeated until there is only one Sovereign remaining on the board.  The player who achieves this goal is said to be the last Sovereign standing and to have won the game. Each player whose Sovereign has been captured has lost the game.

If the position is such that neither of the last two Sovereigns can be captured, the game is drawn between these two players.  The other players have still lost the game.

Two monsters of equal power would resolve the battle based on their elements; a monster of an element can, however, defeat a much weaker opponent that is of a superior element.  Special and Orbit cards affect the game in other ways, preventing an opponent from attacking for a turn, forcing a player to discard a card, and such.

The game ends when one player has no more cards in hand or in front of him or her; the winner of the game is the other player.

Some gangsters have natural affinities for each other; if you manage to put together a compatible gang, the victory condition is lowered for you and the gang gets a bonus when pulling off jobs.

Jobs are resolved by rolling a varying number of dice (depending on the job's difficulty) against your gang's total in Cunning, Charm and/or Combat.  Success garners Loot Chits, which are mostly money but also include bonuses to Cunning (to assign to a gangster).  Gangster Leaders allow you to draw more action cards; Molls allow you to draw more recruits.  Some action cards are starred; this means they are resolved immediately --sometimes to your detriment.

Some launched themselves to safety before it was too late, but others were slow or miscalculated.  Their sky born heirs were mutated, some horribly beyond belief, others invisibly.

As the game was not properly licensed, it was quickly pulled from distribution and is, as a result, quite rare.

(Description from the Diplomacy Boardgame Compendium and Gallery)

This game is based on the basic game mechanics of Diplomacy (moves, holds, supports and convoys), but is set in Tolkien's world of Middle Earth.  The game is played either by two opponents or four players (two per team, one controlling armies and fleets and one controlling the other individuals).  Because the game is intended to be played by two opponents (a person or a team), the one part of the traditional game of Diplomacy that is not preserved in this game is the diplomacy itself.

Despite the lack of negotiations, the basic game mechanics are taken from Diplomacy but with a number of extensions or modifications.  Armies and fleets are supported by supply centers, but can have single, double, or triple strength.  In addition to armies and fleets, there are a number of characters/roles, such as Gandalf, Strider, The Ringbearer, and the Nazgul, each of which has certain attributes or abilities (for example some characters increase the strength of the army they accompany).  There are a variety of special rules regarding terrain, as well as victory points given in special circumstances such as The Ringbearer getting to Mount Doom, a Nazgul with the Ring getting to Barad-Dur, the Ring being captured by Mordor's strongest army, and others.

The players become merchant princes trying to alter the course of world events in return for good profits.  Mercenary was designed with the aim of filling two gaps in the field of wargaming.  Firstly, it is a game involving diplomacy and intrigue that can be played by as few as two people, even a solitaire game being possible and, secondly, it is based on an important period of transformation from a medieval to a modern style of fighting, which has previously been neglected.  This game is designed to give the atmosphere of a corrupt, money-grabbing Europe, torn by military strife, when almost everyone's first thoughts were for self-interest: truly a mercenary age.

Mercenary covers the period of European history from the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII of France to the French Wars of Religion in 1560.  The game, therefore, consists of 11 turns each 6 years in length.  The object of the game is for the opposing players (1-5) known from now on as Merchants to try, by bribery, terror or military conquest, to amass the largest amount of money (measured in crowns) by 1560.

Components include 22 by 21 full color mounted mapboard, 220 die cut counters, 11 by 16 diplomacy chart and rules book.

4223,Borderline: Europe/Middle East Edition,2001,4.375,4,0,2,4,20,20,Children's,Bluffing Card Game Children's Game Trivia ,Hand Management,"This Crazy Eights variant was designed by TV star John Davidson and his wife.

Players start with hands of 8 cards which come from a deck consisting of nations from Europe and the Middle East, bodies of water, and wild cards. The cards have the name of the location on one side and a map on the other side, showing contiguous locations.

The object is to void your hand by playing a card with something that shares a borderline with the last card played. Wild cards when played are automatically considered a match and can then be named as any location in the deck except for those in the player's hand. If a player cannot play a contiguous card, cards are drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand until a card can be played.

Instead of drawing, a player can play a card that does not share a borderline and hope to not be challenged. Challenges can happen after any play. If the challenging player is correct, and the card played does not share a borderline, then the challenged player has to take back the card and take a card from the challenging player's hand. If the challenge is incorrect, the challenger takes a card from the deck and the challenged player gets another turn.

Game on the Waterloo Campaign. Actually Napoleon's Last Battles are 5 games in 1. There are 4 individual battles:


     Quatre Bras
     Ligny
     Wavre
     La Belle Alliance (Waterloo)


with the campaign game linking all 4 maps.

The DG edition adds three more scenarios, including a Grand Waterloo battle scenario.

Napoleon's Last Battles uses the Napoleon at Waterloo system with modifications for command control and Line of Communication. Campaign game starts from Quatre Bras and Ligny and lasts 3 days. Units are mainly brigades.

Kevin Zucker used the rules in a revised edition later on for Napoleon at Leipzig (adding Cavalry Charges) and Four Lost Battles (adding Cards for Movement, General Decisions of Higher Commands, etc.).

After a longer break Kevin Zucker came back with his new The Coming Storm, which based on the former Four Lost Battles concept, adding baggage- and pontoon trains. 
In 2011 The Last Success: Napoleon's March to Vienna, 1809 was published to create a family of games called The Library of Napoleonic Battles which all could be played under the same rule set. Kevin Zucker announced to republish Napoleon at Leipzig in 2012/13 in a 5th edition for the 200th anniversary of the epic battle and plans to republish Napoleon's Last Battles in 2015 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of La Belle Alliance/ Waterloo.

Nevertheless all rule-editions can be used for the original NLB-game.

GAME SYSTEM: 
The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series 
- scale = 480m/hex, 
- time = 1hour/GT,
- strength = 500-800 men/SP.

Lay out the 25 Adventure cards in a 5 x 5 grid, then start dealing out the 52 Number cards to each player one at a time at the players' discretion. If a player is dealt a sequence of Number cards that add up to 8, 9, 10, or 11, they can turn over one or more Adventure cards and place a counter of their color on them, or displace an opponent's counter from an already-revealed Adventure card. If a player busts (is dealt a sequence totaling more than 11), he or she has to remove one of their already-placed counters. The first player to get counters on all five of the Adventure cards in any row or column is the winner.

The approximate playing time printed on the box is 5 to 15 minutes. The box recommends the game for children Ages 6 - 12.

It concerns combat in the 30th century of the Space Era (SE) between defenders and attackers aboard a Kyrathan 'Royal' class warp yacht named (conveniently enough) the Trek Heaven. It's a hex-and-counter game, but has character sheets; players can allocate resources to create characters as they would in an RPG.

The official rules offer four scenarios, designed to ease the players into increasing complexity and role-playing elements: The Rescue of Princess Rulian (one rescuer trying to save the kidnapped princess vs. one terrorist), Krotic's Treasure (one rich guy and three thugs vs. four pirates), Random Piracy (three crew and one die worth of passengers vs. eight or fewer pirates), and Random Raids (all conditions GM- or player-designed).

Approximate playing time is very fuzzy -- obviously the Rescue scenario will play much more quickly than a complex user-designed Random Raid with lots of role-playing. The maximum number of players isn't necessarily 2, but all of the official scenarios assume only 2 sides or factions. To support more players, teams or special user-designed scenarios would be called for.

4308,The Shakespeare Game,1900,2.83333,6,1,2,4,20,20,,Card Game Memory ,MemorySet CollectionTrick-taking,"Victorian game in which each of the 52 cards represents a scene from a Shakespeare play (with fabulous card art!) and has a quote from that play printed on it. It could be played in any of three ways.
In the preferred method, a slightly souped-up version of Authors, the player to the left of the dealer reads the quote on one of his cards. If the next player knows which play the quote is from and needs that card for a set of the four scenes from that play, he gets it. Completed sets are laid down on the table, and whoever has the most sets at the end of the game wins.
When mere amusement is desired and the educational feature not cared for, the second game play method is the most basic version of Authors in which the players ask each other if they have a card for a particularly play. The third game play method is, strangely, a non-bidding four-handed partnered trick-taking game in which the four series of scenes substitute for the four suits in a regular card deck, with the A series always being trump.
The maximum number of players for the third method is four. The maximum number for the other methods could be higher, but it might prove difficult to build sets. The approximate playing time is a guess.
Bottom line: I guess they knew their Shakespeare a lot better at the start of the 20th century than we know him at the start of the 21st.

The tiles are each made of 3 connected hexagons, with each hexagon cut into two trapezoids. Each trapezoid is one of 6 colors and may contain a witch, a witchy object, or nothing at all.

Tiles must be played so that touching sides are the same color. As a result, colored triangular regions will form. These triangles are the way you score points.

In the basic game, each time you make a triangle using the same symbol (or entirely empty) you score 2 points.

In the advanced game, you start the game with one of the colors as your own, and if someone else scores with your color, they must share the points. Also, at the end of the game, if any of your witches are free along the edge of the board, you gain additional points. Witchy objects at the edge will cost you points.

The 3rd game is solitaire. The rules show 4 different shapes and you must try to lay all the tiles to form that shape while adhering to the normal placement rules. According to the rules, only the devil knows if those solitaire puzzles can be solved.

4333,Rip-Off,1975,4.33333,3,2,3,4,30,30,,Economic ,,"An original card game showing how the consumer gets ripped off.  Each player is assigned one of the four categories of businesses, each of which sells goods or services costing 100, 200, 300 or 400 $.  Each player starts with 1000 $.  First player to amass 100 Consumer points wins.

On your turn, you roll a die.  If it is 1-4, you go visit the corresponding dealer.  If you rolled yourself, you pick one of the three others.  If you rolled 5-6, you draw a Consumer card and then go visit a dealer of your choice.  The Consumer cards give small Consumer Point bonuses or penalties, or small cash awards (up to 500 $).  At the beginning of each round, all players receive 100 $ each.

Each dealer has six cards, one Catch card, two Rip-Off cards and three Good Deal cards.  They are spread in front of him, face down, in any order of the dealer's choice.  The consumer then decides how much he will spend (100-400 $) and forks the money over to the vendor.  The dealer then rolls a die and picks up the corresponding card (left to right) from his spread; next, he chooses one of the five remaining cards.  Finally, he picks up the card corresponding to the amount spent (100 $ - first card, and so on up to 400 $ - fourth card).  Thus the dealer has limited control over what choice to offer to the consumer.

The consumer then draws one of the three cards proferred by the dealer (still face down).  If a Good Deal, he receives 10-40 Consumer points.  If a Catch, he receives half as much.  If a Rip-Off, he *loses* 10 Consumer points but has the option of suing.

To sue, pay 500 $ to the Bank, then dice off against the vendor.  If the consumer rolls lower, he lost the suit.  If he tied or bested the vendor, he is awarded compensation depending on the margin of success.  The least result is that he recovers the lost 10 CPs and is refunded the court costs by the vendor.  The vendor may be forced to pay such a large penalty that he goes into debt.  If your debt gets larger than 1000 $, you are  bankrupt and out of the game.  Whilst in debt, you cannot buy when your turn comes, but instead just draw a Consumer card.  All income goes to pay off the debt.

There are grooves in the board for sliding bamboo screens to fit into.

White plays Lord Kira's forces, who set up 9 samurai figures in the home. Black plays the attacking Ako Ronin, represented by 8 samurai figures that are set up outside the home. The White player is attempting to sneak Lord Kira out of the house before the Black player can find him and kill him.

Each samurai figure has a secret strength value printed beneath the block that they stand on. These values range from 0 to 5, with the Black pieces having stronger values overall. One of the white figures is also secretly designated as Lord Kira, the object of the attack.

During each turn, you can move all of your samurai figures 1 or 2 spaces. The samurai may also be used to slide an adjacent bamboo screen once during his move. When an enemy samurai enters a space with an opponents samurai, the players each roll a die and add the result to their samurai's strength value. The player with the lower total is the loser and that figure is removed from the map board. Tie rolls result in both pieces being removed.

Maximum players is listed as six only because that's the number of factions described in the core book: Theofas (continental humans), alefs (elves), dhurgoths (dwarves), the Forgotten (humans with dinosaurs), Selicum (mixed-race islanders with sea creatures), and Swaerthan (Chaos/undead). More than six players could participate if armies were very small, if armies were controlled by teams, or if the players wanted to take a couple days off to do nothing but play.

There are 66 Resource cards of the three varieties in various denominations, 24 Domestic Event cards, and 18 Chaos cards. A game turn consists of drawing Domestic Event cards (which cause Resources to be drawn, discarded, or redistributed), turning over a Chaos card (which threatens the peace and requires an amount of a certain type of Resource to avert), and either passing the Chaos card to the next round or collectively playing Resource cards that total the amount required by the Chaos card in order to neutralize it. If, in ten turns, ten Chaos cards can be neutralized *and* each nation has total resource points equal to or greater than it started with, the players win.

This game was the first and possibly only one produced (in a limited edition of 500) by Pittsburgh-based Borderland Games, whose name and house logo were derived from the classic fantasy novel The House on the Borderland by William Hope Hodgson.

DILLINGER is for 3 to 6 players and, although it uses the actual participants and history of the era in some detail, the game is not a historical recreation. It has been designed, and play tested to a virtual fare-thee-well, to bring about 2 to 3 hours of continual fun for the players.  All players are involved in every player's turn, so there is no down time. In essence, while one player is robbing a bank, the others become the Law Enforcement aspect of the game, trying to stop him with roadblocks, tear gas, gun molls, tommy guns, and whatever else they can throw in his path.

If the Bad Guy (there are 20 historical Bad Guys from Dillinger, to Jelly Nash, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the incredible Barkers, the inept Kelly's, and the truly creepy Alvin Karpis, all rated for a variety of capabilities) succeeds he not only pockets the take, but he gains Notoriety. And accumulating Notoriety is what the players are doing to win. Obviously a successful kidnapping (a rare event) will bring loads of Points, but convicting another Bad Guy with your in-house mouthpiece (again, real-life lawyers, from the great trial attorney, Sam Leibowitz to the down-and-dirty Louis Piquett) can also get you some Notoriety. Opportunities to amass points are ubiquitous, and winning games usually comes right down to the end.

Each game of DILLINGER includes 1 Rules Folder, 1 Background information Folder, 110 Player Cards, 5 Location Mats, lots of Funny Money, and one small sheet of Mike Lemick colorful cut-and-paste counters.

Players assume the role of Overlords who must compete for world domination by recruiting armies of creatures and using them to wage war on the other players.  Build your army carefully, as you will need certain creatures to help you recruit other creatures.  Split your forces with care as your Overlords quests for new creatures to add to the army, as your opponents might slip past you and attack your Keep.

On your move, you first move your King defensively, by sliding to an adjacent free space.  Next, you place a colored peg offensively, hoping to box the opponent King in.

An optional rule allows a captured King to displace a colored peg if it happens to lie on a straight line away from him along with another same-color peg (at any distance).  Further, Kings aren't allowed to come adjacent to each other.

4408,Cyborg,1978,4.38636,11,2,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Fantasy Fighting Science Fiction Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Two-player wargame with both SF and fantasy elements (After the atomic wars, magic filled the land...). One player controls Princess Gloriana and her entourage, who are trying to get from the NE corner of the map to the Holy City in the SW, where Gloriana's coronation will take place. Gloriana is escorted by cyborgs, Amazons, and Imperial Guardsmen, and is watched over from afar by the magic-using Guardians in the Holy City. The other player controls Aemulatio, the sister of the dead king, who is trying to capture and sacrifice Gloriana in order to seize the throne herself. Aemulatio fields mutants, gargoyles, and a pair of Necromancers (amusingly named Kcud and Nootrac) against Gloriana's forces.

Playing time is listed as 2 - 3 hour(s) on the cover, but the rules declare there is no time limit. For Gloriana to win, she must reach the Holy City or totally rout Aemulatio's minions; for Aemulatio to win, her forces need only capture Gloriana (even if Aemulatio and her Necromancers are all dead, which would be a very odd outcome).

A six-sided die (not included) is required to resolve combat, and also to allow the Necromancers to cast one spell with random effects once per turn, and the Guardians to cast one spell each of Mind and Magic per turn.

The lurid cover art by R. P. Dick Winther, seems intent on evoking both Silver Age comics and 1940s pulp magazine covers, but falls far short of Excalibre's self-proclaimed Beautiful graphics and detail. A gargoyle is seizing a terrified Gloriana by the thigh, and appears to be wrestling her atop a rock... but closer inspection of the lower left corner of the cover reveals a second, smaller gargoyle in flight, and the space between it and Gloriana is filled with ant-sized fighting men. Presumably the main figures are meant to be aloft, though you'd never know it to look at them, making this cover one of the worst examples of the classically bad game art of the 1970s.

To give but one example, in Dice Deck Rummy you are dealt 8 cards.  On your turn, you draw a card from the stock or the top discard.  You then roll two dice.  You can play any sets of the number rolled (two or more cards of that value), or any runs (three or more same color cards that follow each other in sequence) that end or begin with the number rolled (counting the dice as an extra card).  Finally you discard.  You can also freely increase played sets and runs on your turn.  First player to go out scores the total value remaining in the other players' hands.

4482,Winchester,1990,6.07,10,0,2,5,60,60,,Racing ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Winchester is a race game where the players score points by getting their pawns around a rectangular track the fastest. Each player gets 3 to 5 pawns (based on the number of players) which are placed on a 4 by 4 starting grid.  The track is four squares wide. During the setup, the players randomly cover some of these squares with wooden blocks to provide obstacles that prevent movement. The location of the blocks is determined by several die rolls.  This random setup provides for a different track each race.

Movement of the players' pawns is controlled by a special six sided chess die. The die contains the six basic chess pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn. Each turn a player will roll the chess die to determine everyone's move for that turn.  Once all players have moved, the next player on the left rolls the die for the next round. When moving, the player must move one of his pieces based on the indicated chess piece.  Like chess, the player may not move off the edge of the board or over one of the obstacles, except for the knight move.  If the player captures one of the piece of another player, the two pieces exchange positions.

The first piece to cross the finish line scores 15 points with each successive piece scoring one less (14, 13, 12, etc).  There are small bonuses for certain finishing conditions (first to have all pieces finish, three positions in a row, etc).

The game comes with a rolled up, laminated board, 25 pawns, 24 wooden blocks for obstacles, one normal die and one chess die.

4483,The Buntu Circus,1997,5.77778,9,3.6667,2,4,90,90,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Pattern Building,"The Buntu Circus was independently published by a group of UK gamers calling themselves The Buntu Circus. It is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The board is divided into a 14 x 14 grid. Each square has a combination of one of eight colours and one of twelve symbols, arranged in a symmetrical pattern on the board.

A deck of cards has one card per square on the board, matching colour and symbol. Each player gets a hand of eight cards and a set of counters and rubber hoops in their own colour. These are metallic colours, distinct from the board colours.

In turn each player draws and then plays a card from their hand, placing or removing a counter on one of the appropriate squares on the board - each colour and symbol combination appears in two places on the board, and has two cards which can match.

The idea is to get a number of linked rows of five counters in your colour, orthogonally and/or diagonally. The target number of rows depends on the number of players - five in a two player game and less if there are more players. Once a row has been formed, it is designated by placing hoops over each of the counters in the row.

There are couple of further wrinkles. Most importantly are the power colours. At the start, each player has power in a single board colour, determined randomly. This allows the player to use a card of that colour to move an counter on the board (their own or another player's) either to an adjacent square of that colour or from a square of that colour to an adjacent square. Creating a row of five gains the player power over the colour of the middle square of the row - this is marked by removing the central counter from its hoop and placing it on one of the power colour markers to the side of the board. In this way players gain power over new colours. If another player already has power in that colour, their power is removed - but the player who gained power merely displaces them - they do not gain power in the colour. Gaining power over a colour in which you already have power reinforces power in the colour. The player hoops the power counter and this prevents any other player from gaining a row that would give them power in that colour. In effect they have a lock on that colour. A final wrinkle comes with the discard piles. Played cards can be discard to one of four face-up piles. Once one of the four draw decks is exhausted, the adjacent discard pile is turned over - but not shuffled. This allows long-term strategies of stacking the deck with particular colours or symbols.

The quality of the components is superb. The board is big and colourful, the symbols clear and distinct. The player's counters are chunky plastic discs which come in little cannisters like pill-boxes. The hoops are rubber-like rings which come in individual cloth bags. Very satisfying to hoop your rows with.

The board is 10x10 (1 inch squares), with the inner 4x4 squares replaced by a 10x10 grid of smaller squares.  The whole thing is in the middle of an octagon, with the edges used for storage of the 80 colored pegs.

Each player starts with ten pegs of a color.  Each player places a peg in turn in the inner grid.  You are eliminated if: a) you have two pegs (of your color) in the same row, column or diagonal; b) you take more than a minute to place a peg; or c) you seek help from a non-player!  Once the inner grid is complete, play continues/repeats with the outer grid (you remove a peg from the inner grid and place it in the outer).

Optionally, the last player can try to finish placing all 80 pegs whilst respecting the exclusion rule.

Note that the outer grid is actually harder to solve because of the 4x4 hole in its middle.

Headwinds kept you from playing the 500 mile cards. Beside obvious disasters like running out of fuel, you had to deal with ripped fabric and broken propellers. There were no equivalents to things like puncture proof tires and extra gas.

Box cover shows a plane flying across the ocean.

A similar game called The Lindy Flying Game by Nucraft Toys came out in the same year and was apparently the subject of a lawsuit by Nucraft against Parker Bros which the latter won. This caused the Nucraft game to have a far more limited production  the company ended in 1928 after having changed the game to CRASH, THE NEW AIRPLANE GAME  and thus their game is far more valuable to collectors today.

Based on the historic flight of the same year, hazards include forced landing, storm,  fog, engine trouble, etc.

Inventor was a flier in the US Navy and also made gliders and models.

Came out in the same year as the similar game Lindy, the New Flying Game by Parker Bros., apparently the subject of a lawsuit by Nucraft against Parker Bros which the latter won. This caused the Nucraft game to have a far more limited production and thus their game is far more valuable to collectors today. 

     Not so sure about this interpretation. A note on the rules for
     Nucraft's game Crash game indicate that Parker Brothers bought
     the rights to the Lindy game from Nucraft. So it would seem
     that Parker bought out Nucraft and shelved their version of
     the game.



After the lawsuit Nucraft issued a different game called Crash, The New Airplane Game. It seems to be a Parcheesi type game played with three planes per color and a four color spinner.

Nucraft Toys ended in 1933 when the company started operating under the name of its founder Paul K. Guillow.  The company Paul K. Guillow did not produce any games.

The wild third colored marble is placed first in the center of the 5x5 grid. This overcomes the problem that the pyramid on a 5x5 base requires an odd number of marbles to build.

In Pyramids the goal is to get rid of all of your playing pieces first. If placing a marble completes a square and at least three of the marbles in that square are the players color, then the player gets to place an additional marble on top of the square. If the additional marble completes another square, then using the same rule as before the player gets to place a third marble on so on.

Since the two players may have overall played a different number of marbles towards the end of the game, the game might be over before the pyramid is finished. The game obviously cant last longer than 27 moves since there is no rule to remove marbles in Pyramids.

Each turn a player plays a card (reveals evidence) to the discard pile where everyone can read the information. The cards a player keeps in his hand are considered 'withheld evidence'. A player may also play a subpoena card to look at all the cards in a given players hand or to increase their own hand size. Play continues like this until a player thinks they can solve the mystery. They announce their solution (Who, Motive, How) and then reads (silently) the solution. If correct, they win, if not, they are out of the game and play continues.

Game is (very slightly) compared to the 'How to Host Your Own Murder' series, in that once the game is played, it cannot be played again by the same players, as there is only one solution.

In the initial phase of the game, players place these tiles on the table (there is no board) in one connected group, but are not allowed to connect more than 5 of their color together.  Once all tiles are placed, a turn generally consists of exchanging the positions of any two tiles.  The object is to unify all of one's own tiles into the same country (connected group).  The King protects the tiles in its group (another player can only remove one by swapping it with his or her own King), but can only be moved once for free - after that a penalty must be paid.  The Warrior offers additional movement abilities.

The game was originally published in 1975 under the name Kingdoms.  The version shown, titled The Game of Ancient Kingdoms, was published in 1976.  The rules are nearly identical, with the later version adding the penalty rule for moving the King and a rule for scoring draw games.

This is done in such a way that by the end of each trick, each player will have a card face down in front of them. These cards are then turned face up and the winner of the trick is determined.

Others can steal from you when the amount of body parts in your warehouse exceeds or is equal to your die number. This balances things out and keeps the players stitching their monster together (using their cards) to keep their warehouses (card supply) from being raided.

Art may be too gruesome for the youngest players.

4633,Stop,2001,4.58667,15,2.3333,2,10,30,30,,Card Game ,Hand Management,"Stop is a variation of Uno, with players trying to empty their hand of cards by playing onto a discard pile by matching the color or number of the card on top of the pile. Stop also includes a few special cards and rules to tweak the gameplay and differentiate it:


     6s and 9s are considered to be identical, so a 6 can be played on a 9 regardless of the color and vice versa.
     If a player has a number card identical in color to the top card, she may play it out of turn onto the discard stack.
     An exchange card allows the player playing it to have everyone give their cards to their left- or right-hand neighbor.
     The +X card forces the next player to draw the top card of the deck and add it to her hand. If it's a number card, she must also draw that many cards.
     The +2 card forces the next player to draw two cards and skip her turn  unless she also plays a +2 in which case the next player must draw four cards, etc.
     A skip card skips the next player.
     A stop card, which is numbered 0, can prevent the action of an exchange, +X, +2 or skip card played by the previous player.


When a player runs out of cards, the other players score points based on the cards they still have in hand. After multiple rounds, the game ends if a player has 500 or more points; the player with the fewest points wins!

4634,Warhammer Warriors Battle Books,1999,4.61111,27,2,2,2,20,20,,Fighting Novel-based Science Fiction ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"A Warhammer version of Lost Worlds based on Games Workshop's 40,000 setting. Each player uses a battle book and chooses a page number for a maneuver for their turn. These are revealed simultaneously and cross-referenced. A chart then shows you which page to turn to see  the results of the maneuvers. Players usually end up wounded or in a better position to strike a killing blow.

Warhammer Warriors is slightly more stream-lined than Lost Worlds and plays faster. Warhammer Warriors does not have behind you maneuvers and there is a lot more shooting/ranged combat. All characters have a Deathblow maneuver which speed up games if you're in a good position.
Great art by Karl Kopinski, Kev Walker, and Wayne Reynolds.

Heroes go on quests to discover powerful artifacts. Dragons can fly across territories to raze and pillage. Mighty leaders send hordes of mercenaries and strange creatures into mortal combat.

Troop types range from basic infantry, knights, mystic creatures, and heroes. Each troop card is placed in a battle line and casualties are removed from the front of the line unless they can be targeted with a special ability. So generally you want to place your toughest units in the front lines.

Each card lists its strengths and weaknesses. The number of stars across the top represent the amount of damage it can take, followed by number of dice it  rolls in combat, offensive strength, and defensive strength. This seems simple, but the addition of creatures, special abilities, artifacts, and spells add to the strategy.

4669,Harry Potter Dicers Game,2002,4.45,10,1.5,2,2,10,10,Children's,Children's Game Collectible Components Dice Fantasy Movies / TV / Radio theme Novel-based ,,"From the Warner Bros. website:
Dicers is a collectible dice game with two levels of play. Knock your opponents dice out of play in the basic game, or develop unique combinations to expel dicers to the dungeon in the advanced game. For ages 5 years and over.

The dicers game is played with collectible dice. These have 5 clear sides, with a figure representing the character inside of the dice. The sixth side is solid, and shows the name of the die, its casting number, its special ability, and its affiliations. The clear sides are numbered from 1 to 5, while the solid face is the '6'. Each die represents a character or item from the Harry Potter stories.

The starter set includes 6 dice; Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Hagrid, and the Sorting Hat. It also includes a sheet of rules.
The rules actually have 3 levels of play described in them. The basic game only uses the casting numbers on the dice. The Intermediate game adds in the abilities of the dice, and different areas of play, and the advanced game adds in the affiliations of the dice, and reserve abilities.

In the basic game, players set out the six dice and each take turns picking one to determine which dice they will use. Players then roll to see who goes first (the Challenger).
The challenger picks one die, and then the defender picks on of their dice.
The challenger may roll the die a number of times up to its Casting number, looking for as high a roll as possible. Only the last roll made counts, even if it is lower than a previous roll.
The defender does the same with his or her die.
The lower roll is expelled (removed from play) and the winner becomes the new challenger. This is repeated until only one player has dice left.

In the Intermediate game, there are three areas of play. All dice begin in the Field. A losing die is placed in the dungeon, where it cannot be used. A winning die is placed in the Keep. Dice in the keep cannot be used until a player has no dice left in the field, at which point all of the dice in that player's Keep are moved into the Field. The winning die can choose to either expel the losing die to the dungeon, or to just place it in the Keep and activate the special ability of the winning die. One side of the rules lists the different special abilities. A few examples include:
Capture, which lets you take the enemy die and use its special powers as well as your own.
Summon, which lets you retrieve a die that has been placed in the dungeon.
Swap, which lets you trade the locations of two of a player's dice.
The game ends when one player's dice are all in the dungeon or captured.

In the Advanced game, you can use the affiliations on the dice. The affiliations include the four houses, creatures, and wizards. For every die with the same affiliation as your chosen die in your Field, your die gains +1 to its casting number. This level of the game also adds reserve abilities. These are special powers that, when activated, have no immediate effect but allow the die to be set aside in 'Reserve' and activated later.

Extra dice are sold as single dice. The die you are buying is clearly displayed on the outside of the packaging.

The packaging stated that there were 54 characters to collect but only 36 were released.

There were two 'Starter Packs' with 6 dice each and 24 individual dicers.

4670,Proclaim!,2002,6.88889,9,0,4,10,45,45,,Bluffing Party Game Word Game ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Players take turns giving clues to their fellow participants. Clue givers try to construct one-word clues that will lead others to guess the Proclaim! word. There are up to 3 rounds for each word, and the earlier the round, the more points that are awarded to the clue givers and correct guessers. The more people that guess the correct Proclaim! word, the fewer points that are awarded to each person, so clues must be clever enough to lead players to different possible answers to maximize their score. Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points. For example, if a guessing player is certain they know the Proclaim! word, they yell Proclaim!, and roll the dice to determine the number of points to move forward for a correct guess, or backward for an incorrect guess. Also, the clue giver earns a unique bonus if the guessing players each give a different answer.  Play continues until the first player has successfully advanced to the finish space on the Proclaim! board.

There are also swap spaces, which allow a player to attempt to steal a state from the opponent by answering a more difficult question.

4685,Piedestal,1981,4.5,2,0,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"From the instruction sheet:
PIEDESTAL is a three-dimensional strategy game for two players, and is played on a somewhat pyramid-shaped playing board. The Pawns start at the bottom-most spaces on the board and try to move up to the large, central top-most space: THE PIEDESTAL. Meanwhile, the Knights guard the PIEDESTAL and try to remove the Pawns from the game before they can reach the PIEDESTAL.

The Pawns win the game if five of them reach the PIEDESTAL, otherwise the Knights win.

SETUP: The twelve Pawns are placed three to a corner on the three lowest level spaces in each corner. The eight Knights are placed next to the PIEDESTAL, on all eight of the second-highest spaces on the board.

MOVE: A Pawn can move to a space on the next higher level directly beside it. Or it can move any number of spaces around the same level, unless blocked by another Pawn or Knight. The Knights can move the same way, with the additional advantage of moving either to a lower or higher level.

CAPTURING: During his turn, if a player is able to capture an opponent's piece, he must do so instead of making an ordinary move. To make a capture, the player moves his piece onto his opponent's space, and removes the opponent's piece from the board. A Pawn is able to capture a knight only if the Knight is one level higher than the Pawn, and directly beside the Pawn. A Knight is able to capture a Pawn only if the two pieces are on the same level, and directly beside one another. A player can never make more than one capture in his turn.

A pencil and paper is required since creatures have huge life totals, a Centaur Paladin has 53 life points for example. If the defending creatures survives, it can make a counter-attack by rolling even more dice. You continue until all attacking or defending creatures have been removed.

Crime Scene: When Norma Ashby heard they were closing Lakeside High School and tearing it down, she was devastated.  She, one of the few alumni left in town, was on a mission.  She would save the school.  She decided to have a reunion and convince her old classmates to help her purchase Lakeside High.

This was the high school reunion weekend.  The 'get re-acquainted' party the night before was a great success.  In fact so much so that the eight of you and Norma decided to meet at the Lakeside Greasy Spoon before going to the 60's, 70's 'Rock 'n' Roll' costume party.  Norma never made it that night.

Norma had said she would save Lakeside High or die trying.  And, that is exactly what happened.  Norma Ashby was found dead in her home.  She had been shot to death.

The Suspects:

Debbie Rowe: A devoted wife and proud mother.  Driven by her competitive nature.  How far would she go to be number one?

Blake Walker: He is a soap star.  An 'idol' who has it all.  A beautiful wife, wonderful children...what more could he ask for?

Mary-Lou Potts: A successful businesswoman with a razor sharp mind and a troubled past.  Left Lakeside and vowed never to return.  Was attending the reunion a cover...for murder?

Doug Griffin: An ex-football player.  Spoiled and reckless, he hates rules and regulations.  Was his next play unsportsmanlike conduct?

Dr. Veronica Hardy: A psychiatrist and marriage counselor.  Haunted by a past she tries to keep secret.  Was she all psyched out?

Dr. Wayne Hardy: Veronica's husband and business partner.  He is attractive, friendly, and self-assured.  He and Veronica have it made.  Would he risk it all for revenge?

Wendy Larose: A high priced Madam.  She is quick-witted with loose morals.  Would she do anything, or anyone, to get what she wanted?

Randy Whalen: Police Officer for Lakeside's finest.  He was a forceful personality, not to be crossed.  Has crime and violence become a part of his nature?

4743,Life of the Party: Mystery of the Mislaid Egg,1987,0,0,0,8,8,180,180,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Party Game ,Role Playing,"This is one of the Jamie Swise murder-mystery role-playing games published by Just Games. It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their Life of the Pary line in 1987.

Episode: Mystery of the Mislaid Egg

Faberge: The Man and the Egg 
Peter Carl Faberge was born in 1846 and died in 1920. The Russian achieved fame by designing dazzling fantasies in gold and silver, set with precious stones and further decorated with brilliant enamel work. After winning a medal at the Pan-Russian Exhibition in 1882, his work attracted the attention of the Tsar. This ultimately led to the creation of the series of Imperial Easter Eggs. Faberge's eggs were first commissioned in 1886 by Tsar Alexander III, for his wife, Maria Feodorovna. The tradition continued with Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra.

The Plot: Imperial Russia is about to collapse. Members of the Pahlov family, cousins of the Tsar, are clinging to the tattered shreds of Imperial privilege. Shortly after the Peasant Circus celebration, the family's prized Imperial Faberge Easter Egg was discovered missing. The family regards the egg as a symbol of legitimacy and social status.

The Time: March 1917

The Place: Petrograd, Russia

The Cast:

Vladimir Pahlov: Head of the House of Pahlov and disgraced military leader. Vladimir led 300,000 men during the Battle of East Prussia in 1915, but couldn't find a fourth for a game of bridge when it was over. He currently courts peasant girls and designs Petrograd's defense for the impending Red invasion.

Natasha Pahlov: Wildly eccentric grand dame of the House of Pahlov, wife of Vladimir, and possessor of the largest shoe collection in Mother Russia. Natasha believes that the shoes vie for social position and partake in scandalous gossip. As a result, the footwear is constantly monitored and rearranged in the Imperial Shoe Chamber.

Lord Peter Welthrop: Natasha's half-brother and second cousin. Welthrop has lived in the House of Pahlov for the past six months. A native of London, he fled to Russia after running his father's bank into the ground. Destitute and confused, Peter spends most of his time in the Imperial Sable Yard, poking the animals with sticks and watching them bare their teeth.

Ludwina Pahlov: Beautiful and manipulative daughter of Vladimir and Natasha. Ludwina has persuaded the family to adhere to the practice of Khlysty (Flagellants). Flagellants believe that a person must sin and repent before he or she can become closer to God. This belief inspired the Pahlov family tradition of the Peasant Circus. This bimonthly event calls for the humiliation of invited peasant guests.

Grigory Yamovich: Disheveled yet hypnotic mystic. Invited home by the adoring Ludwina, Grigory became the guest who wouldn't go away. Besides indoctrinating Ludwina with the nuances of Khlysty, he ensured his usefulness within the House of Pahlov by seemingly curing sickly sables through hypnotism.

Zudnyet the Dung Hauler: Preferred peasant of Natasha. Zudnyet is keeper of the Imperial Compost Pile and overseer of the Imperial Beet Patch. He invariably sits beside Natasha during the Peasant Circus celebrations, clad in sable furs. Zudnyet is often summoned to Natasha's chambers for late-night discourses concerning man and God.

Olga Grimach: Lady-in waiting to Natasha and a woman of true inner strength. Most of Olga's time is spent as shoe organizer for Natasha's sometimes animated footwear collection. When not soothing soles, Olga writes eternally senseless poetry for a lover no one has ever seen.

Tatiana Mikhapolov: Sister of Vladimir and chief rival of Grigory. Tatiana is constantly trying to drive Grigory from the House of Pahlov in hopes of curbing the family's slide into a moral abyss. She poisoned his tea, dropped glowing embers in his shorts, and pushed him out a third story window-all to no avail. Grigory loves the attention.

Episode: Passion Cabana in Havana

Katherine Hobley, a pillar of Philadelphia society, was spending a carefree vacation in Havana, Cuba, in the spring of 1943. It seems she became involved with some interesting characters who frequented a run-down bar in Havana called the Passion Cabana. Upon her return to Philadelphia, she promptly withdrew $1 million from her bank account. She was accompanied by a rather disheveled young man, possibly of Cuban descent. Her anxious family has not seen or heard from her since.

The Time: May 8, 1943.

The Place: The Passion Cabana in Havana

Max Hammond: A 35-year-old man who came to Havana in 1940. He is the owner of the Passion Cabana and has a black belt in karate. The funds he used to purchase the club supposedly came from the proceeds earned form twelve years of bounty hunting in the States. While rumors link Hammond romantically with every woman who ever crosses his path, he actually lives alone with a parrot and a motorcycle which hasn't run in two years.

Harlan Standard: An expatriated American author of some of the most controversial fiction of the '30's. Standard came to Havana to escape the constraints placed on him by his sexual and political leanings. A New York book reviewer slammed his latest book by saying, Who wants to read drivel penned by a man whose heart lies in Stalin's boudoir? Standard lives at his Aunt Edith's compound under her iron-fisted rule.

Mama Lisa: The gregarious madam of the largest house of ill repute in Havana. On the streets, Mama Lisa is known as an angel of mercy to her girls and the island's most vengeful practitioner of voodoo to her enemies.

General Luis Beltro: The brutal leader of Havana's provincial militia who refers to himself as Luis the Eraser. He has gone on a one-man crusade of late, driving most gambling and prostitution operations out of Havana. Beltro is catching heat from his superiors. They feel he should spend more time dealing with the growing bands of communist rebels which ring the outskirts of Havana.

Maria Solez: Smoldering, black-eyed beauty who is Max's closest advisor and night bartender at the Passion Cabana. Maria is rumored to be the only person on the island woman enough to tame Max Hammond's amorous urges.

Edith Pitvay: The youngish dowager of Cecil Pitvay, the late sugar cane magnate. Edith owns a large compound on the beach which has been a refuge for struggling artists and site of some of Havana's more decadent parties. Rumors of a chamber of horrors on the compound have never been substantiated, however.

Marylin Desmond: A seemingly permanent fixture at the Cabana. Marylin is renowned for her ability to consume enormous amounts of rum. Despite the amount of time she spends at the place, this well-dressed and well-spoken woman has managed to keep almost everything about herself a secret.

Reggie Van Peller: The fianc in search of his beloved Katherine. A product of all the best schools, Van Peller was exempted from military service because of a large monetary donation to a member of the local draft board. Devastated by Katherine's disappearance, Reggie let his membership to the Hubris Polo Club expire.

Episode: The Coffeehouse Murder

Folk singer Jeremy Swain was found dead in an apartment above the Gate of Fate Coffeehouse. He had just finished a two night engagement at the club before embarking on his first national tour. It was very uncool what got laid on poor Jeremy. Like, it was a stone drag. Dig. Invite some faces over to the crib, make a scene, and riff on who did the cat up.*


    Translation within


The Time: August 16, 1958

The Place: The North Beach area of San Francisco

Patty Farb: Department store heiress with too much money and too much time on her hands. She often gave money to struggling artists she felt showed promise. Patty had affairs with most of the performers at the club and once fell especially hard for Swain. She also gave her money to many causes and was once, for a short time, a member of the American Communist Party. She attended a party for Swain that evening and claimed she was with one of her artist friends at the time of his death.

Art Fez: The bongo playing comedian who opened the show for Swain and doubled as the M.C.. Fez was active in the labor movement in the late 1940's and at that time a good friend of Swain. Fez was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) While he was cleared of any wrong-doing, he was black-listed from the clubs and was playing his first gig in four years. He did attend Swain's party but left early. He stated that he was searching the streets for a restaurant that served purple gelatin at the time of Swain's death.

Barney Fawn: Forty year-old club owner and amateur UFO watcher. Fawn claimed to have had encounters with alien beings and believes some of the acts he hires are the next closest things. He would loan struggling artists moderate sums of money and then have them pay him back by playing his club for peanuts. He did not attend the party, choosing to remain downstairs counting the night's receipts instead.

Teresa Wilcox: Was Swain's live-in but was not sharing the apartment during Jeremy's current engagement. They had been having marital problems of late. Wilcox also served as Swain's back-up singer but did not perform at the Gate of Fate. She attended the party but was unclear of her whereabouts at the time of his death.

Rocky Tuttle: Young and aggressive loan officer of a small bank. Tuttle was making the scene often in the past few months. Although he was as square as they come, Tuttle and Swain struck up a close friendship. He did not attend the party and was vague about his movements around the time of the crime.

Del Finney: Swain's business manager and owner of a dry cleaning store. He was a big force behind Swain's success and was a hard working as any manager of a folk act could be. Finney was not at the party. He left right after the show to make final preparations for Swain's next date.

Natalie Corvus: She was a chronic club hanger-on who fancied herself a talented singer. She would invariably come on stage every amateur night and belt Gregorian chants at the top of her lungs. Natalie was often seen outside the club in Swain's company and it was well known that Teresa found that fact unbearable. Natalie was at the party but left after a boisterous argument with Wilcox about the former's singing or lack of singing talents. She claims she was star gazing at the time of death.

Fran Fern: Fran was the manager/bartender at the Gate of Fate. She was briefly married to Swain during the lean years. Active in many causes, she once lobbied to have the raisin declared the national fruit. She stayed in the club to clean-up and did not attend the party.

A variant of the Axis  Allies board game system, it offers an easy to play D10 based combat system and territories with resource values for production. 
The War to End All Wars presents the First World War in a couple different ways. The first of these is a historical simulation that offers alliances, political structures, and entry times for the various nations designed to mirror the actual historical chain events that transpired in real life. The second scenario is the semi historical scenario and makes allowances for player choices and deviant actions by many nations. This scenario can see Japan get more active in the war, the US and/or Italy possibly enter on the Central Powers side, the Ottomans stay neutral or even join the Allies, and much more.

While not a complex game that breaks down the individual national armies into named brigades or divisions, the level of historical detailing in The War to End All Wars is enough that multiple professors now utilize this game to help teach the WW1 era to middle, high school, and even college students.

The War to End All Wars comes with:



1) 2 piece 17 x 44 color game map on thick glossy paper. Map provides an enlarged game area for Europe, then smaller map zones for Asia, Africa, and North America to allow for representation of the entire global war.

4760,Life of the Party: Murder in Paradise,1986,5.66667,3,2,8,8,180,180,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Party Game ,Role Playing,"Milton Bradley produced 8 mystery party/role playing games (in the vein of How to Host a Murder) in 1987.  They were all called Life of the Party games, four mysteries and four murders.  The back of all boxes indicates that these are also copyright Jamie Swise Games, as that outfit produced several of their own titles (and several, if not all, of these) a few years earlier.  Copyright date below is based on the Jamie Swise date on the invitations.

Episode: Murder in Paradise (1986)

You are one of ten people who won all-expense-paid trips to O Ma Ka La Pu A Uu Wahine le O Kale I O Kamaka E A, an island in the South Pacific.  You received an invitation in the mail and a cassette tape which contained the island's Department of Tourism theme song.  While it is not the most convenient time for you to take a trip, you felt compelled to honor the offer.

On the third night of your stay, during the treasure hunt, two of the guests were murdered.  They were identical twins Joel and John Rogers.  The brothers were very wealthy traders of precious metals and two of the most disruptive and obnoxious people (once) alive.  The remaining eight people are suspects in the crime.

4761,Jamie Swise Mystery Games: Who Killed Roger Ellington?,1982,6.16667,6,1.5,8,8,180,180,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Party Game ,Role Playing,"This is one of the Jamie Swise murder-mystery role-playing games published by Just Games. It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their Life of the Pary line beginning in 1987.

Episode: Who Killed Roger Ellington?

The Plot: Post-war America was thriving in 1948, as was murder in a small Massachusetts town. Industrialist Roger Ellington was cut-down in the prime of his sordid life. After eating a plate of snails, he succumbed to what appeared to be a most deadly strain of indigestion.

The Time: Aug. 9, 1948

The Place: Washington Station, Massachusetts

The Cast:

Major Deegan: Lifetime resident of Washington Station. Deegan was Roger's chief competitor for women, status  everything for as long as anyone could remember. A well-trained mercenary, Deegan returned to town shortly after the war, satisfied that he and a few others had saved theWestern world from evil. He couldn't remember where he was the night of Roger's death.

Derrick Ellington: Stepbrother of the deceased, had been away in the Merchant Marines for ten years, returning to town a year ago. Derrick became engaged to Sara Admunson after his return. She died shortly after in an auto accident. A drunken Roger was driving her home from a party when he lost control of the car. Derrick crawled into a bottle shortly after the funeral and never came out. Always looked down upon by his brother, Derrick never lived up to the Ellington name. Perhaps that is why he sought refuge in the Merchant Marines for all those years. He couldn't remember where he was the evening of the murder.

Cybil Admunson: Sister of the late Sara. It was common knowledge that Cybil loved Roger. A social climber, Cybil was not liked by many. At her sister's funeral she exchanged some pretty harsh words with Roger. While deciding on which college to attend next, she worked as hostess at L'Escargot. She was on duty that night.

Arnold Green: Boston College student working at L'Escargot for the summer. Green was not a born waiter, and was publicly humiliated by Roger on several occasions. Green served that evening.

Yvonne Drake: Master pastry chef at L'Escargot, she came from Paris shortly after the war. A cold foreigner, she did not mix easily with the locals. However, she was having a rather obvious affair with Steve Watson. Yvonne was in and out of the kitchen all evening.

Steve Watson: Young, energetic man who come from Boston in 1946. Steve was well liked and was Roger's business partner in many deals. He was president of the local Chamber of Commerce. He dined with Roger and Gastonne that evening.

Gastonne Schmidt: Owner and head chef of L'Escargot. Since his arrival from Paris a year and a half ago, Schmidt had become known as an arrogant yet likable eccentric. He gave the town a bit of European class, and his gruffness only added atmosphere to his establishment in the eyes of the townspeople. He dined with Roger that evening.

Katie LaFemme: Local party girl with the proverbial heart of gold. Having had a painful on-again-off-again affair with Roger, Katie knew of his dark disposition. She once bellowed from her roost in Jerry's Bar, Someone ought to put him out of my misery! She also couldn't remember where she was that evening.

Carla Hendricks, Age 27.  Vice President - Public Relations of Hendricks International.  Lawrence's little sister - with ideas of her own about how things should be run.

4765,As the World Turns,1966,6,3,2,2,6,60,60,,Adventure Economic Movies / TV / Radio theme Travel ,Roll / Spin and Move,"As played by the Hughes family on the Television Show As The World Turns.

The game mechanics are very similar to the shortened game version of Monopoly.  Players are dealt Passport and Travel cards at the beginning of the game and pay the Customs Fund (bank) the value of those cards.  Players then take turns moving their pawns around the board.  If they land on a city space, they pay the indicated amount to the owner(s) of the passport(s) for that city.  Landing on other types of spaces results in various actions like drawing a Customs card, spinning the world spinner, and moving off-course.

The winner is the person with the most money when the game ends.  The game ends when a player completes both legs of the course and lands on the home space.  Triggering the end of the game is optional: if a player doesn't think he/she has enough money to win the game, they can pass the home space and continue along the second half of the course.

4767,Murder on the Orient Express,1967,5.7,10,0,2,6,0,0,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Novel-based ,,"This game takes place on the famous Orient Express. There are 12 spies on the train as well as the detectives Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. The players take turns moving the detectives and the spies around the train and keeping track of their movements. Every 8 turns (8 hours in the game) they check their notes and determine which spies have been killed. A spy is killed if it is ever a) alone in a compartment or corridor square for 1 or more hours, b) a second spy enters the compartment or corridor square and c) the spy is never in the same compartment or square as one of the detectives afterwards. Since the status of a spy is not determined until turn 8 (or 16 or 24) it is possible to move a spy, which is already dead. This spy cannot kill other spies even if it fulfills the conditions above. Since the status of a spy depends entirely on their movement it is important for the players to keep careful notes and to be able to defend their logic to the other players.

Players spin the cutlass and move their ships round the board on their way to the treasure chest. If the spinning cutlass lands on 'Blast', the spinning player gets to attempt to 'blast' an opponent's ship by placing an air pump into one of the two openings adjacent to the move space...and slamming it! The result? Roughly one-in-three chance the opponent's ship will be blasted into the air!!! (and forced back three spaces)

Careful, if your ship is on the same move space, you can blast your own ship!

The winner is the first person to make it around the board and pass the treasure chest. The treasure chest is placed in a new location each game, so players can't memorize the pattern of safe spaces.

Similar in 'pump' mechanics to BattleBoard.

White Flag Over the Seven Seas -Or- Who Took Down the Tyrant?

This murder mystery game for 10 players is set during the last dinner on board the great luxury liner, only hours before it sank. Here's your chance to enter the world of Edwardian opulence, and see what it was like to be aboard one of the most famous ships of our time!

It's April 14, 1912, and you've been aboard that luxury liner deemed unsinkable, the R.M.S. Tyranic, sailing from Southampton to New York on her maiden voyage. Though some call it the Ship of Dreams, you soon learned it should be called the Ship of Schemes, especially after meeting Mr. Ty Rante, President of the White Flag Line. Tonight you've been invited to join him for an exquisite dinner party, one that could prove to be as chilling as the icebergs floating around the North Atlantic this time of year. So come inside to the First Class Dining Saloon, to a dinner just sparkling with Edwardian opulence.
YOUR DINNER COMPANIONS INCLUDE:

Captain R. Eddy Touretire, is the dashing and daring captain of the R.M.S. Tyranic. Having enjoyed a long and distinguished naval career, the maiden voyage of the Tyranic will be the last for him. He'll be sad to say goodbye to the high seas and intends to retire to a small cottage by the British shoreline. Of course, he always wears his captain's uniform.

The Inextinguishable Milly Beige, as she's often called, earned her nickname after surviving 5 shipwrecks, 3 train collisions, one plane crash and a bad case of lockjaw. A radiant and ravishing member of the nouveau riche, she's an American millionairess who's not afraid to spend her estranged husband's money. She's always dressed to the nines and never goes anywhere without her lucky Egyptian statuette.

Countess Jewel S. Auplintee is one of the loveliest and most ladylike members of the Austrian aristocracy. Dignified and delicate, she is known for the abundance of jewels she's collected since childhood. As a Countess, she keeps apprised of the affairs of state, and doesn't believe that war is coming. Of course, she wears only elaborate, jewel-encrusted fashions.

Thurstan Thur D. Klaas is a freewheeling, free-spirited amateur artist, who was lucky enough to win a ticket aboard the Tyranic in a last minute poker game at a pub near the docks. A man who lives from dime to dime and dollar to dollar, Thur makes his living as he goes. Ruggedly handsome, he has the muscles to prove that he's used to hard labor. He wears the only clothes he owns - corduroy pants, a high-collar shirt and a tweed jacket - unless, of course, he should happen to borrow a tuxedo for dinner.

Primrose Prim Ann Propper is a governess by trade and responsible for the education and upbringing of the two young Morganstine children. Pretty and particular, she is a woman of high moral standards and comes with excellent references. She boarded Tyranic against her better judgment, having endured weeks of premonitions and omens, warning her that the ship will meet with disaster. She wears either high-collared, conservative clothing, or borrows an evening gown from her employer for dinner.

Dr. Grayden Gray V. Deeger is a German Egyptologist, famous for his survival of King Tuff's tomb. Having unearthed more than his share of gold and lapis-laden treasures, his exploits have made him famous in his country, with the Kaiser being his number one fan. Dr. Gray is often described as an eccentric intellectual, willing to sacrifice all for his science. He usually wears a tweed suit or a tuxedo for dinner.

Senorita Suelita Sue Parficial is a flashy, fiery and famous Flamenco dancer, a woman of both great grace and passion. Born in Chihuahua, Mexico, her parents sent her to Europe to study dance when she was a young girl. Now she has been summoned home to Mexico by her father, a wealthy cattle baron with strong political connections. Sue always wears the latest of Paris fashions, though they tend to be more flamboyant than most.

Father Morrosse O'Dreary is an Irish Catholic priest, known for his sermons on the sanctity of suffering. Once considered a candidate for pope hood, he now heads a small parish in the Irish countryside, at the Church of Our Lady of Incessant Anguish. Father O'Dreary always wears his priestly collar and black clothes, and discreetly carries a whiskey flask wherever he goes.

Lady Mya Arstite is an enchanting and elegant member of the British aristocracy. She is famous for her exquisite balls and lavish dinner parties, and is possibly the utmost socialite of the new century. Claiming to know anyone worth knowing in all of Europe, Lady Arstite is among the growing numbers who believe that war is inevitable. She wants to take one more pleasure cruise before the shells start flying. She wears only the most up-to-date evening gowns from Paris.

The Case of the Wirst Case Scenario

A murder mystery party game for 10
That magnate of the publishing world, Mr. William Rudolph Wirst, President  CEO of Wirst Publishing, has invited you to attend a very special celebratory dinner to be held at the Hi-8 Hotel, Midtown Manhattan, New York. After dinner, Mr. Wirst will unveil the latest title soon-to-be published by his company: It was the Wirst of Times, It was the Best of Times. The manuscript, of course, is Mr. Wirst's own memoirs, and he promises to regale everyone with excerpts - information that some might even consider, well . . . shall we say . . . scandalous? Incriminating? Surely it will be a night to live on in the memories of all who live through it . . .
Your Dinner Companions Include:
P. Leigh Jerreyes is an RN by trade, and new to the world of writing. She is a budding author who has written her first book of poems entitled, Bedpans and Betadine. She's brought her manuscript with her, hoping to convince Mr. Wirst to publish it. After all, her creative writing teacher told her she was raw with talent and wide-eyed with wonder. Leigh herself modestly dismisses such praise, saying I only want to pursue one of my greatest dreams in life. She wears her nurse's uniform wherever she goes.

Lilla Li Belle S. Lander is a media darling whose articles have been published in every major newspaper across the country. Flashy and charismatic, Li is an award-winning journalist whose written words spark controversy and terror in even the most sedate circles. She is also hoping to sell her first book-length Washington expose': The Hussies in the House. Li often wears business suits or professional clothing.

Allyssa T. Fairre is easily the most successful tabloid writer in the country. Her work of tracking down Elvis-impersonating extra-terrestrials has brought her a great deal of notoriety. Suave, elegant and chic, she is known to turn up anywhere around the globe in pursuit of a story. Never married, she claims to be in search of the right rich man for a husband. Yet she rarely lacks handsome male escorts, and often wears rather revealing attire.

Starr Cross is the epitome of the femme fatale romance writer and her books have long topped the romance charts. Her latest titles, The Letches of Lidgefield County and Lust Knows No Bounds, have sold well over twelve million copies worldwide. Yet hers is a rags to riches story: Starr worked as a cocktail waitress before selling her first book. Her rise to the top was the equivalent of a bungi jump in reverse. In the publishing industry she is considered to be a hot property, frequently sought after by other houses and literary agencies. Starr prefers clothes with ribbons and ruffles.

Lowe Z. Ajante is a used car salesman turned literary agent who is sure his hard work will pay off soon. He believes in good old American free enterprise, waving his stars and stripes in the faces of pouting pessimists. He knows his attempts to constantly upgrade his stable of authors will eventually bring him fame and fortune. Lowe is a flamboyant dresser who believes polyester double-knit has taken a bad rap, and is sure it will make a comeback any day now.

Murray Mur DerMisteree is an internationally famous writer of mystery novels, second only to Agatha Christie. Though some say he has far surpassed the Queen of Crime, as he is critically acclaimed for the realism of his work. Makes you feel like you're right there committing the crime, says the L.A. Whines. Personally, Mr. DerMisteree has been described as a brooding intellectual, a genius in his genre. He frequently wears his hunting clothes.

Pickford Pick E. Publichere is a new publisher who has recently released a number of trendy titles, including - The Mother-in-Law Excuse Book: A Guide to Avoiding Holiday Hassles and Other Traumas. He has been described by Kiss Up Now magazine as a calculating, competitive entrepreneur, sure to make it big. His closest colleagues call him Pick, while the thousands of writers who receive his rejection letters each year refer to him by different names. Pick always wears business suits.

Ray Gene Bull is an award-winning sportswriter who enjoys traveling to remote parts of the world in search of little-known sporting events. Thus he is known in professional circles as the Mr. National Geographic of the sports world. Physically fit and ruggedly handsome, Ray is a former quarterback for Poedunck University. He is as popular with members of the opposite sex as he is with his readers. Ray prefers clothes that display sports logos.

Portia Por Rytere is a literary novelist whose mixed metaphors are often only understood by MENSA members, and whose analogies are so deep that one must reread her books many times to grasp the hidden meaning. Her latest seven-hundred page novel, And Then They Died, is a fictitious rendition of the mating rituals of tsetse flies, and like her other books, is published by Wirst Publishing. Por is the past president of Superior Novelists of Balderdash, or SNOB, and the ex-wife of Richard Rytere. Elegant eveningwear usually comprises her wardrobe.

Richard Rich Rytere is sometimes called the King of Commercialism, having capitalized on the quick read. One of Wirst Publishing's hottest authors, Rich's books have yet to miss the bestsellers lists. His latest novel, Life, Love, and Rain Falling Silently on the Mountaintop, is bound to be his greatest work yet. But fame and fortune have not changed Rich - he's still the same fun-loving guy from Philly, who prefers hot dogs to filet mignon. He owns a wide collection of flashy ties.

Ever wonder what it would be like to be a famous author? Here's your chance to play one for the evening! Why don't you try on fame and fortune and see what it feels like?

This mystery is probably the easiest ten-person mystery game to put on. Since the setting is modern day, the costumes are usually something a person finds in their closet.

So have fun, and while you're at it, sign a few autographs for your adoring fans!

The handle is then pulled so that new categories are revealed in the windows above each letter.  The sand timer is turned over, and everyone quickly writes down the name of something that fits the category and begins with the given letter tile.  Once time runs out, the players score their answers.  Players score five points for every player that did not put down the same answer as they did.  So players not only have to come up with a correct answer, they need to find one unique enough not to be duplicated by the other players.  The player with the highest score after a certain number of rounds wins the game.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN MAYHEM -or- Who Felled the Famous Female Flyer?

The year is 1937, and while the Great Depression is nearly over, whispers of war are in the air. Roosevelt has started his second term and the Golden Age of Radio is in full swing. You've just spent a week in the glorious splendor of the Colorado Rockies, where the warmth of the June weather has turned the mountains into a breathtaking bouquet of wildflowers, while the pines whisper in the wind overhead. As a guest of the Lumber Lodge, you've enjoyed hiking and horseback riding, painting and pottery classes, and just sitting on the back porch reading a good book. Ah, yes, the retreat has truly renewed your spirits. What could possibly upset the sense of serenity you've come to find in this Rocky Mountain hideaway?

But alas, all good things must come to an end. So tonight, come join your fellow frolickers, (many of whom are famous!), for a Friday night farewell dinner. It's sure to be a celebration that will live in on the memories of all. That is, in the memories of all who live to remember . . .

Your Dinner Companions Include:

Wanda Munnie has recently resigned from the Rockettes and is on her way West to Hollywood. As a natural when it comes to acting aptitude, she's certainly destined for fame and fortune. Once in Tinsel Town, Wanda wants to wangle her way into the starring role of Hollywood's biggest movie ever: Gone with the Water. Languid, lovely and a little bit liberal, she always wears the latest of '30s fashions.

Sigmund Fluoride is an internationally acclaimed German doctor, famous for his innovative combination of psychoanalysis and dentistry. Best known for his edible complex, Sigmund teaches that a tooth will never change unless it really wants to. Truly loved by his patients, he goes to great lengths to make their lives more enjoyable. He wears his white doctor's jacket at all times.

Allison Allie Bye Riskie is a grand dame from England, world famous for such mystery novels as: The Man in the Burnt Orange Suit and, And Then There Was Nobody Left. Having amassed a great fortune as a novelist, she is often seen dripping with diamonds. She's independent, outspoken, and always in need of adventure. Though strangely enough, wherever she goes, someone turns up dead at dinner . . .

C.O. Pilate is most famous for having flown second in command to that famous female flyer, Sheila She S. Earbourne. An outstanding pilot as well, C.O. is magnanimous and methodical, and always dresses in pilot's attire. And while C.O. has taken a backseat to She S.'s notoriety, C.O. does have one claim to fame that even Miss Earbourne can't top - on a solo flight, C.O. saw aliens from outer space.

Madame Liza Lott is an exotic beauty from central Europe. Having come from a long line of gypsy fortune-tellers, Liza hopes to help humanity by revealing the future, a future she claims will never hold another World War. Often described as being mysterious and melodramatic, Liza prefers to dress in the costume of her native land.

Turner Turn N. Kafkaff is an Austrian author famous for his existential writings, especially his collected works known as: The Elongated Euphemisms. Most elaborate of his euphemisms is: Toast in the tummy is as good as bread in the belly, unless you happen to be dead. Never a slave to fashion, Turn tends to dress in a style all his own.

Hinda Berg is a daring dirigible pilot from Germany who truly believes that blimps will be the transportation of the future. That's why she's currently writing a How-to book on piloting the gigantic gasbags. Hard-working and disciplined, she's not afraid of the grunt work that goes before the glory. She prefers simple, unadorned clothing.

J. Ellis Mann, a columnist from a small town Kansas newspaper, is best known for his oblique obituaries. For as Ellis has often said, You're never really famous until you're dead. Ingenious and introverted, Ellis is usually described as being egotistical and eccentric. He is never seen without a cashmere cardigan and bow tie.

Emma Q. Wac is a doctor from New York who truly stands on the cutting edge of medical technology. A brilliant physician, Emma specializes in treating rare cases and hardly ever has a moment to herself. Famous for her bedside manner, Emma is sleek, smart, and sophisticated. She wears only designer dresses.

B. Iggy Mowth is a nationally loved radio show performer, who, along with his wife, stars in the B. Iggy and Windee Mowth Hour. Wise, witty and wonderful, is how Iggy is often described. For he's a man who is never too busy to frolic with his fans, especially his female fans. Iggy always wears the latest of '30s suits.

This mystery game is a spoof on the final fate of Amelia Earheart, though it's a much more interesting version than some of the more popular theories of the day. (She landed on an island? How boring is that?)

This game actually has a mystery within a mystery, and you'll enjoy the international cast of characters. Quite the convoluted bunch!

Also, the character of C.O. Pilate is written with the option of being played either as a female or a male character.

This is a mystery that makes history humorous!

Murder on the Millennium -Or- Who's Killing Time?

It's the turn of the Century, and you're standing on the brink of a whole new Millennium. What an exciting time to be alive! Especially since you've been invited to attend a very special Millennium New Year's Eve dinner given by that famous entrepreneur and inventor, Millford Mill N. Iam. Yes, Mill has invented a time travel machine and will be transporting one outstanding individual from each decade of the last century to attend this extraordinary dinner. Of course, the party will be held at Mill N. Iam's historic castle of a home, in sunny Southern California. When dinner is over, all the attendees will cast their vote for the Person of the Century. It's a party you won't want to miss, a real once-in-a-lifetime event, a night to reminisce about days gone by . . . That is, for all who live to remember . . .

Candidates for the PERSON OF THE CENTURY include: (By Decade)

1900-1910, Emma Rhymere is probably the foremost poet and novelist of the last century. Born and raised in Boston, she's traveled the country by train, reading her book of poetry, Moors, Mores, and S'mores, to the uneducated masses across the Western frontier. Criticizing the gluttony of the rich, Emma is level-headed and lovely, and wears the high-collared, lace-adorned clothing of her time.

1910-1920, Mia Curall is easily considered the greatest scientist of the twentieth century. Having won Nobel prizes for both medicine and physics, her greatest claim to fame came when she discovered a cure for Bigpox. She's often described as being methodical and a little bit maniacal when it comes to her work, though socially, people say she has an electro-magnetic personality. She wears the latest of post-war clothing.

1920-1930, Rich A. Phellar, the owner of Substandard Oil, is easily the wealthiest man of the twentieth century. Having inherited his money from his father, Rich considers himself a true blueblood. Though he's hard-nosed and hard-handed when it comes to business, in social settings he's refined and respectable, a true gentleman. Of course, he wears only tails and a top hat for evening events.

1930-1940, Scarlett Harlot is probably the most gifted and gorgeous actress this century has ever known. The original fainting femme fatale, she has starred in such box office hits as: It's a Wonderful Wife, and The Lizard of Schnoz. Scarlett believes a good actress should be demure and sweet, a thing of beauty like a fine painting or sculpture. She wears only the most glamorous and glitziest of evening gowns.

1940-1950, General George S. Lapem is considered one of the greatest military minds the US Army has ever known. His amazing leadership abilities, along with his talent for combat strategy, played a huge role in the winning of World War II. Gruff, rough, and tough, the General was raised in a military family and comes from a long line of Generals. He only wears army fatiques or his uniform wherever he goes.

1950-1960, Eve N. Louder is probably the greatest fashion designer of the century. But she's also the founder of Eve N. Louder Cosmetics, one of the world's top-selling companies when it comes to make-up and perfume. Rich, spoiled and eccentric, Eve considers herself to be the original fashion police, claiming her only real goal is to make the world a more beautiful place. She always wears dresses of her own design.

1960-1970, Blaze A. G'laury is an all-American hero, one of the first men in space, circling the globe during a top-secret space mission, better known as the Neanderthal project. Originally from Oklahoma, Blaze is a big, brave, brawny and brainy guy, who grew up reading science fiction. Not only does he have the right stuff, but women everywhere refer to him as Mr. Right. Blaze wears jumpsuits wherever he goes.

1970-1980, Polly Esther Pance is probably the most influential journalist and activist this century has ever known. Founder of The Save the Sasquatch Society, an organization dedicated to the preservation of Big Foot, Polly has been involved in sit-ins and shutouts, march-downs and walkouts. She only wears the finest polyester clothes and never goes anywhere without a hefty slathering of blue eyeshadow.

1980-1990, Wylie Wy Toukay, is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the century, having essentially created the personal computer industry as well as the software industry that goes along with it. With an I.Q. that tops the genius range, Wy ushered the world into the Information Age and became a ga-zillionaire in the process. Wy dresses purely for comfort, never really caring about what he wears.

1990-1999, US President William Willy Groper is probably one of the more colorful presidents of the century. Described as having a dichotomous disposition, he's often charismatic and calculating, charming and crafty. With his award-winning smile, Willy is a real go-getter, a man whose cause has unfortunately, caused a few improprieties. Willy only wears clothes that bare a Presidential insignia.

This is an especially fun game if you and your guests plan to dress in costumes! Because the character roles span the entire century, everyone will be wearing fashions from a different decade. Hence you'll have Emma Rhymere in her long skirts comparing herself to Polly Esther Pance, in a pantsuit or mini-skirt. How shocking! The true gentleman, Rich A. Phellar, will be appalled by Wy Toukay's casual attire, especially at dinner!

To make things even more fun, the characters from the later decades will already know the history which the characters from the earlier decades are living. Plus, the characters from the earlier part of the century will be amazed by the world of the future, the world of computers and faxes and fast cars.

All in all, this game has a number of interesting dimensions that will keep your guests entertained for hours!

4806,Mysteries by Vincent: A Perfectly Perilous Pageant,2002,0,0,0,10,10,180,180,,Deduction Murder/Mystery ,Role Playing,"How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.

A Perfectly Perilous Pageant -or- Who Shot the Shoo-in?

It's time once again for the annual Ms. Medusa Pageant, a beauty pageant sponsored by Medusa Hair Care, Inc. for women of all ages. This year, Ms. Sella Konn, the reigning Ms. Rocky Mountains, is just sure she's a shoo-in. In fact, she's so sure she'll win the crown that she's planned a little pre-pageant celebration, a party that many might find presumptuous, to say the least. So put on your best pageant attire, sharpen your claws and come join the party. Then watch the sparks and accusations fly, because everyone knows, the competition at a beauty pageant can really turn ugly . . .

The Character Roles Include:

Rinah Plastee is a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having recently won the title of Ms. Texas Panhandle. A waitress from Odessa, Rinah is a twice-divorced mother of three. Determined, dedicated and driven, she's sure her pageant talent of skeet shooting will wow the judges and make her a winner. She always wears her Ms. Texas Panhandle crown and sash with her elegant gowns.

Nathanel Parks is the dashing and adorable host and announcer for the Ms. Medusa Pageant. But he is most famous for singing the Ms. Medusa song every year when the winner is crowned. Charming, chatty, and chipper, he is a precision performer and claims to have show biz in his blood. For evening events, he wears the same tuxedo he wore when the pageant first started ten years ago.

Sharon Sharalyke is the reining Ms. Medusa. A native of Milwaukee, Sharon was originally crowned Ms. Urban Sprawl. She is a professional caterer and home-entertaining expert who now hosts her own cable TV show called Domestic Dazzle. Creative, confident, and capable, Sharon specializes in bringing back the abilities of bygone eras. She sews her own elegant evening gowns and never goes anywhere without her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.

MaeBea Shellwin is a telemarketer from Topeka. She is also a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having been crowned Ms. Great Plains just months ago. Her talent of a dramatic reading from her favorite romance novel really swept the judges away. Sweet, sappy, and sentimental, MaeBea claims to be a hopeful romantic, meaning she hopes to bag the Ms. Medusa crown in order to bag a husband. She prefers soft, dainty gowns, and always wears her Ms. Great Plains crown and sash.

Dr. Tuck N. Liphte is one of the world's foremost plastic surgeons, sometimes called the King of the Collagen injections. With the right surgery and medical procedures, Tuck claims he can make any woman stunningly beautiful. Sociable, sophisticated and sardonic, he takes a personal interest in his patients' well-being and often makes house calls. He wears the utmost of evening fashions.

Taykano Priznerze is another Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having won the title of Ms. Continental Divide. A taxidermist by trade, she owns her own company called Stuffed with Style, whereby she specializes in decorating her subjects with sequins and rhinestones. She plans to use her stuffed animals in her ventriloquist act for the pageant's talent competition. Smart, swank, and sultry, she prefers sparkling gowns to go with her Ms. Continental Divide sash and tiara.

4808,Fighter-Bomber: The Game of Mustangs and Messerschmitts,1977,4.75,8,1,2,2,20,20,,Aviation / Flight Dice World War II ,,"(from the box)

A Military Strategy Game

A military game of logic, luck and tactics for 2 players

Your assignment, strategist, is to shoot down your opponent's squadron before he gets yours!


In this aerial combat game, players must move their Fighter-Bombers across to the opposite sides of the board (the 'target areas') and release their bombs in order for their planes to gain maneuverability and become Fighters.

The second goal is to use your Fighters and your friendly Flak to shoot enemy planes.

As soon as your first set of three Fighter-Bombers enters the opponent's half of the board, a further three enter the game on our side.

Movement is defined by three dice numbered (blank), '1' or '2' apiece, each dice defining movement for one plane.

Enemy planes are shot down by 'over-flying' (jumping) them.

At the end of their movement turn, intruding planes are also subject to 'flak bursts' (color form type markers preset by players on a replica of their half of the battlefield, and slid under the transparent cover sheet which covers the gameboard).

Any planes sitting on 'flak bursts' after the replica map is slipped under them are destroyed!

First player to succeed in shooting down his opponent's squadron of six planes wins the game!!!

4818,Empire,2000,7.25,8,3,2,4,240,240,Abstract Wargames,Abstract Strategy Ancient Political Territory Building Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Empire is a strategic level, traditional hex grid and counter wargame set in a hypothetical ancient era continent.  The game is best with 4 players but can be played with 3 or 2.   Players must manage the economic, diplomatic and military affairs of their faction as they vie for control of the Empire.  Piece density is low  117 units.  The game is low to moderate complexity by traditional wargame standards.

The map contains 15 (fictional) provinces of varying sizes and terrain.  There is a large ocean area.  Each Province produces Tribute (in gold coins) for the player who controls it, the amount depending upon the number and size of cities in the Province.  Tribute is spent on building units, supplying units in the field, diplomatic initiatives, building fortifications, hiring mercenaries, and bribing other players.

Military units are Light and Heavy Cavalry, Light and Heavy Infantry, Imperial Guards Infantry, Warships and Siege Engines.  No province can produce all of these and some can only produce 1 or 2.  Units attain Veteran status after engaging in battle, which increases their effectiveness.  Mercenaries can be hired from neutral provinces but cost more to supply than regular units.  Naval battles and amphibious operations are possible (and may be necessary, as one Province is an island).

Units use an innovative combination of area movement (in friendly territory) and hex-by-hex movement (elsewhere).  Cavalry moves first and, uniquely, exerts a Zone of Control.

Each Province may, at any given point, be neutral or controlled by a player.  Control may be obtained by military means (by occupying all of the provinces cities) or political.  A wide variety of events trigger an Influence Check, which can result in a change of Political Control.  The Political Control system is really the heart of the game.

The turn sequence consists of interlocking phases: each year contains an annual phase for collecting tribute and resolving control changes, 4 seasonal turns for building and supplying units and conducting diplomacy (etc.), and 12 campaign turns for military operations (campaigning in winter is more costly).

The map is printed on glossy paper; the counters are on thick cardboard but need to be cut out.

Overall, Empire presents some innovative game mechanics which complement its theme well.  Fans of ancient era wargames or games with a strong diplomatic element should take a look.

BOOGIE WOOGIE BUNGLE UP -or- Who Bopped the Bea B. Opp?

It's December 9, 1943. Gentle snowflakes fall softly on New York City as the Christmas season goes into full swing. While World War II is raging across the ocean, world-renowned USO singer, Bea B. Opp, is preparing to leave for another tour through war-torn Europe. Tonight she has invited you to a private dinner party at that famous New York City hotel, the Alldorph Hysteria, where she often performs when she is stateside. After dinner, Miss Opp will debut her latest song, written by Big Band leader, Harry Lumbar. What a wonderful opportunity to see her perform before she and her troupe leave for the front lines, to nobly entertain our brave soldiers for Christmas on her upcoming USO tour. Yes, it's sure to be a night filled with glitz and glamor, as the stars come out to show their stuff. But you know what they say about stars: They always burn brightest before they die . . .

Your Dinner Companions Include:

Constance Leigh Wyning, who epitomizes the beauty and dazzle of a USO singer. Always effervescent, she gurgles with talent, motivating our boys abroad to Fight! Fight! Fight! Yet her sparkle is more than skin deep; she's a home grown girl from the Midwest, a real American sweetheart, discovered and brought to the stage by Bea B. Opp herself.

Tito Tellar is a man of great mystery and intrigue. Though very little is known about Tito, he's often been seen traveling across Europe, never far from the front lines. Always keeping his emotions in check, he's known to be impeccably groomed and well-dressed. Yet oddly enough, no one seems to know where he comes from, or for that matter, where he's been.

Major Hornswagle Horn D. Augge, is the military man in charge of Bea B. Opp's USO tour group. He's an officer who takes great pride in the way he handles his entertainers, particularly his female entertainers. Flamboyant and fun-loving, he joined the armed services when he realized a uniform is like a magnet when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.

Jessica Jess Abell, can easily be described with one word - patriotism, with a capital P. She would do anything to help our boys fighting overseas. First there was her stint as a factory worker, a regular Rosie the Riveter, building airplanes to wipe out the Third Reich. After retiring there, she came to work as Bea B. Opp's personal secretary, traveling with the USO tour and bringing happiness to fighting men everywhere.

W.A.C. Pilot Bunny Bun P. Landon, is the pilot who transports Bea B. Opp's USO troupe across the ocean and throughout Europe. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Bun. She's wanted to fly professionally since she was a little girl, when her father, the late Colonel Girrup Landon, first took her for a spin in a biplane. Spunky, gutsy, and known to dress in either great glitz or her flying fatigues, she always personalizes her outfits with a monogram.

Oliver Ol W. Ashedup, is Miss Opp's agent and manager. A shrewd and charismatic businessman, without him, Bea wouldn't be where she is now. Ol is the kind of man who enjoys working hard, but likes to play just as hard. When he's not busy promoting his star, he's a happy-go-lucky, modern man of the 40s, who's not afraid to have a little fun once in a while.

Harry Lumbar is a world-renowned Big Band leader, one of the country's finest. His songs are heard in every dance hall in the free world, and hummed in the homes of his fans everywhere. The name Harry Lumbar can hardly be mentioned without being followed with such descriptions as brilliant or genius. Personally, Harry thrives on his stardom, especially since he worked so hard to get where he is. Cordially charming and never too busy for his public, his stints in the USO show have only made him even more popular than ever.

Winona Wi Bauther, is the youngest daughter of that famous Vaudeville family act, the Royal Bauthers. Grown up to be a glamorous songstress, she was a shoe-in when Bea B. Opp was gathering together a USO troupe. Sophisticated, sleek, and always the professional entertainer, she someday hopes to be as big a star as Miss Opp herself.

This is a fabulous mystery for those of you who love the 1940s and big band music. Because the storyline is centered around a USO troupe, playing swing music throughout the party is a must. Also, if you're looking for a party where everyone can dress up more glamorously, this is the game for you.

And since this game is set in December, if you like, you can even drag out your holiday decorations and set them up to add to the scene. This is especially fun in the middle of summer.

Ah, yes, was there ever a more romantic era than the 40s?

High Noon on the Silver Spittoon -Or- Who Reaped the Ritch's?
 Go West young men and women! The date is September 14, 1885, and you've been invited to join R. Eli Ritch, Colorado cattle baron and railroad tycoon, known for his power as well as his politics. You and his private party will take a weekend pleasure trip on that famous train, the Silver Spittoon, as it winds through the splendor of the Rocky Mountains, from Durango to Telluride. Of course, you'll be staying in one of Mr. Ritch's private Pullman cars, as well as eating in his private dining car. And on Saturday night, you'll enjoy a special celebration dinner, courtesy of Mr. Ritch's hospitality.

So pack your petticoats and pantaloons and hop aboard! It promises to be a weekend to remember. And for some, the opportunity of a lifetime . . .

Your Dinner Companions Include:

Mariam Ritch is the wife of your host, R. Eli Ritch. Refined and ravishing, she runs the Ritch household so Eli can run the ranch. For she's a woman who knows her priorities and her place, and puts her husband first. Always wearing the latest of fashions from the East, she's a real society lady. Though it's rumored that her past may not be so reputable . . .

Bad Billy Bob Bobbitt is a rawboned rambler, known to travel from town to town, though no one seems to know what he does for a living. And while he's as good with a gun as he is at the gambling table, word has it his picture has been seen on more than one Wanted Poster. Shifty and shady, he's usually dressed to ride the range.

Burgandy Bur Dello, a favorite at the local watering hole, the Sure Shot Saloon, is the Belle of the Bar and star of the cancan. Having gotten her start in San Francisco, she prefers life in the wilds of Southern Colorado. She's saucy and showy, and known throughout the West for her charms that men just can't resist.

Chief Lost'Um Land is an elder from the little-known Sowee tribe, formerly located high in the Southern Rockies, but now living on a desert reservation in New Mexico. Diplomatic and insightful, he's greatly respected among his own people, as well as the white men's agencies. For he often says, It's never a good day to die. And of course, he always dresses in his native attire and carries his hatchet everywhere.

Virginia Virgin Gnomoire, is the local school marm, having relocated to the Wild West from the civilized East, where she received her formal education. She's intelligent, articulate, and patient with her students. But beneath her prim and proper exterior, as well as her conservative clothing, she's a raging beauty.

S. Cooper Coop DeNuze, is also from the East. Both a newspaper writer and a novelist for 7 novels, he's come to the West to capture the colorful characters that have aroused the curiosity of Easterners. Outgoing and inquisitive, Coop prides himself on getting the story that sells the copy. He always dresses professionally,and since he's been out West, he sometimes wears a combination of Eastern and Western attire.

Manfred Man Euell Laybore, is a hard-working, honest man whose backbreaking efforts helped build the railroad that Eli now runs. Strong and ruggedly handsome, Man is known to be up front and direct in his dealings. Yet he's widely popular with the other railroad workers and known to be a leader when it comes to labor issues. His attire usually fits the occasion: whether that means working on the tracks or attending a Sunday social.

Aimee Aim Ann Chute, is considered the best aim in the West, and is the star of Beaver Bob's Mild West Show. Independent and headstrong, she first learned to shoot to put food on the table. Now as she travels the countryside with the Show, she lets no man run her life. She's considered a woman years ahead of her time and often wears pants or pantskirts.

See the West as it never was . . . Or at least, we hope it was never like this . . .

Not only does this game have some amusing and not-too-terribly-bright characters, but this game is especially fun when it comes to costume potential! When your guests arrive at your party wearing 1880s attire, you'll see a complete transformation of their personalities. This is your chance to travel back to a colorful time in history, when the West was still wild and untamed. The setting is Durango, Colorado, where an 1880s train still takes sightseers through the splendor of the Southern Rockies.

HARD DRIVE HOMICIDE -or- Who Offed the Icon?

Welcome to Sillycon Valley, California, and to the Boardroom of Snaphu Software, Inc., where you've been summoned by the CEO himself, Major Hugh G. Snaphu, to attend an urgent late-night business meeting. The reason for the meeting remains a mystery, though the Major did mention in his email that the sparks would be flying. Could Snaphu Software have slipped from the #1 spot in the hard-core software wars? And why did the Major invite his main competitor, Bill D. Phences, CEO of MacroHard, Inc.? And what is the secret behind Snaphu Software's meteoric rise to the top anyway, especially since, prior to owning his company, Major Snaphu had been an Airforce jet jockey, and knew nothing about software? In any case, this is one meeting that's sure to be murder . . .

ALSO ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MEETING WILL BE:

Florence Flo P. Disque, the lovely and luscious Personal Administrative Assistant to Major Hugh G. Snaphu, CEO of Snaphu Software. Highly efficient and energetic, Flo is a master at anticipating the needs of her boss, aware of what he wants even before he asks. She's gung ho and outgoing, and known to be gutsy when going after a goal. And despite working in a corporate setting, as a former cosmetics salesperson, Flo prefers the most feminine of fashions.

Bill D. Phences, now in second place in the software wars, thanks to Major Hugh G. Snaphu's meteoric rise to the top. Yet Bill is still called the King of the Computer Software Industry, since his company, MacroHard, held the #1 position for years. With an IQ of 392, Bill is not only resourceful and rich, but known to be ruthless when it comes to the competition. He always wears a business suit and glasses.

Harvey Har D. Riive, a computer software engineer who graduated from MIT before he'd even acquired all his permanent teeth. A true child prodigy, he is now Snaphu Software's top technical talent, helping the company rein high above the rest. Brilliant and baby-faced, Har is far too busy to find time for fun, let alone notice the change in fashions. Thus his wardrobe tends to be slightly outdated. As an asthmatic, he carries his inhaler wherever he goes.

C.D. Rhomme, the wise and wondrous Head of Accounting for Snaphu Software, who is highly qualified when it comes to calculating. Born and raised in Arizona, C. D. has always had an aptitude for arithmetic. Often described as being amicable and equitable, C. D. appreciates people as well as corporate profits. When it comes to clothing, C.D. is thankful for the latest trend in Business Casual attire.

Margaret Mar Keating, the marvelous Director of Marketing at Snaphu Software. Pretty as well as professional, Mar is known for her niceness, and sometimes considered too naive for the hard core world of computer software. But Mar often defends herself by saying, I'm only kind until someone crosses my path. Then that's the last stupid thing they do. Mar wears nothing but business suits and professional attire.

Sergei Ser F. Dinette, the Director of the Shipping Department at Snaphu Software. As a former United States Postal worker, Ser thrives on efficiency. But in his job and with his work load, efficiency counts. For as far as he's concerned, the Shipping Department is the pulse of the company. Direct and determined, Ser is a big believer in honest and up-front communication. He prefers to wear military-type clothing.

A. Leanne Baybee, the gorgeous gal pal of Major Hugh G. Snaphu. Yet despite her striking good looks, Leanne truly subscribes to the maxim that beauty is only skin deep. Unique, extravagant and known to be an independent thinker, she might be considered unusual by the average citizen. But she hardly cares about criticism from the mediocre masses, as she lives by her own set of standards. Of course, she has an exceptional sense of fashion, one that always flatters her features.

S. P. Anaugge, a computer software engineer new to Snaphu Software. Dedicated and detail-oriented, S.P. is determined to make a good impression, and not afraid to work long, long hours, sometimes staying at the office late at night when no one else is around. For S.P. knows that perseverance and persistence can bring great rewards, not to mention an early retirement. Wanting to fit in with the company dress code, S.P. wears appropriate professional attire.

This game is the ultimate in easy entertaining! In fact, it's the kind of game where you can call a bunch of friends the day before and put the party on the next night. It's written for food delivery and the costumes only require your guests to go to their closets. Plus, two of the characters, C.D. Rhomme and S.P. Anaugge, can be played as either male or female characters, so you don't have to worry about getting an even number of men and women. Like I said, it's the absolute easiest mystery game to host!

And because the setting is a late-night business meeting, I suggest serving the food on paper plates and using plastic utensils. The drinks can be served in mismatched coffee cups, since people in a work environment would each have their own coffee mug. To make things even more fun, I'd also recommend hanging a few pie charts around, showing the comparison between Snaphu Software and MacroHard Software.

Besides all that, these are some of the funniest characters we've ever created. Flo P. Disque is cosmetically challenged, and A. Leanne Baybee is absolutely . . . well . . . you'll just have to play the game and find out!

LYNCHED IN LUCRE VALLEY -or- Who Rigged the Rig?

It's July, 1952, and the oil industry has been booming in Alberta, Canada since the end of WWII. New oil reserves have been discovered just as fast as wildcatters can set up rigs and drill. As a result, new oil and oilfield service companies have been springing up like Alberta winter wheat. One such company is Drye Holle Drilling, founded by Mr. Dryesdale Drye Holle of Lucre Valley. And tonight, you've been invited to attend the company's First Annual Safety Award Dinner, in honor of Drye Holle Drilling's remarkable safety record. And of course, the affair will be catered by the local Crude Cafe.

Now the real question remains: Will Drye Holle Drilling have an outstanding safety record for a second year in a row? In any case, one thing is certain, murder would definitely mar that record . . .

Your Dinner Companions Include:

Tarra Tar Sanze is a sassy secretary who mans the front lines of Drye Holle Drilling. Known for her smarts as well as her savvy, she's a tornado on the typewriter and a dervish when it comes to dictation. Pretty as well as proficient, she's had more than her share of suitors, but the oil industry remains the love of her life. She dresses to fit the occasion - pants or skirts for trips to the field and dazzling dresses for dinner.

Derek Hand is the dashing Drilling Manager at Drye Holle Drilling, a company Derek has worked for since he and Drye returned from the War in Europe. Hard working and an industry expert, Derek's loyalty to the company is legendary. Because he's constantly on call, he prefers to wear casual work clothes.

Madame Mae Kittup is an exotic beauty from the Ukraine, a gypsy woman whose psychic powers include telling the future via her magic pysankas, or Ukrainian Easter eggs. Sultry and mysterious, Madame Mae is employed by Drye Holle Drilling to locate oil reserves far beneath the Earth's surface. Yet she attributes her great gift to her grandmother, and prefers to dress in the clothing of her native land.

Denver Driller is a rich and rugged oilman from the States, whose business frequently brings him to Canada, where he plans to reap the rewards of the country's bountiful resources. A world traveler, he's charming and charismatic, and a favorite among the locals. He dresses to suit the occasion, with a wardrobe that ranges from designer suits to dungarees.

Olivia Ol Barrinesse could be described in three simple words: rich, refined and ravishing. Originally from Calgary, she's the daughter of the late Brigham Barrinesse, from whom she inherited her wealth, as well as her independent and highly profitable oil company, Brigham Oil. Ol is always dressed in the height of fashion, famous for her foreign shopping sprees and her bounty of baubles.

Andre P. Renure is a bold businessman who provides a valuable service to the oilfield consumer by running Lucre Valley's only general store and restaurant, the Crude Cafe. A Frenchman from Quebec, he came to the West after the War, hoping to amass a fortune from his vocational ventures. Shrewd and sophisticated, his suits are the latest of fifties fashions.

Beulah Beu T. Kween is a beaming beauty from the heart of bovine country, who was raised on a cattle ranch in southern Alberta. Having won more than her share of beauty contests, everyone says her future is bright, that she'll be married with a house full of kids before she can say baby boom. Flirtatious and fun-loving, she currently works as a waitress at the Crude Cafe, where she earns enough money to keep her wardrobe stocked with delectable dresses.

Royal T. Ohhner is an Alberta cattle rancher whose range reaches far across some big beefy underground oil reserves - oil reserves that are leased to and drilled by Drye Holle Drilling. Thus Royal often jokes about raising both crude and cattle, which have proven to be real cash cows for him. A real grass roots kind of guy, he's never been one to steer away from hard work. He wears nothing but Western attire.

This mystery game features a Western Canadian setting. (If you've never seen Calgary and the Canadian Rockies, then you've never really lived!) So, of course, we used some classic characters that you might find in that neck of the bush -- the Frenchman from Quebec, the Ukranian woman and her psyankas (decorated eggs), a cattle rancher and the people in the oil industry. Of course, there's also a mention of playing hockey.

Besides all that, it's set in the early 1950s, which provides so much opportunity for costumes, as well as setting the mood. People can dress either 1940s or 1950s style, and you can easily play music from both decades.

All and all, it's a fun romp, with the same lunacy and ludicrousness as the rest of our mystery games. Watch out for the surprise twist at the end!

That is, provided everyone makes it through the night . . .

Your Dinner Companions Include:

Princess Anastasia Ann L. Retentov claims to be the only surviving descendant of that great Russian Retentov line. And because of a little-known twist of history, she is the last remaining heir to the Russian throne, daughter of Czar Frugalin Retentov I and Czarina Wautor Retentov. Having fled the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, Ann came to America for sanctuary. As a princess, she carries herself regally, being a classic Russian beauty and dressing in the finest of fashions.

Dewey Kare, is a baseball legend who has redefined the game, being both a pitching phenom and a home run hitter. But being worshiped as a hero got tiresome for Dewey. So he recently retired, and has traveled to the wilds of Montana in search of a new adventure. Yet he never forgets his years in the big leagues, and always wears a baseball jersey.

Cassandra Cass Piajammas is a lovely  luscious starlet, having recently starred in her latest film, The Monotony of Marlene. And soon she is to grace the silver screen as Valentino's leading lady. Which is no surprise, considering acting is a talent that comes quite naturally to Cass. After all, her mother always did say Cass was a little melodramatic. But she's also a thoroughly modern woman of the twenties, a real flapper. And like most flappers, she's opinionated, daring and slightly out-of-control.

Barry Bare Marquette is a Wall Street whiz known for his gutsy gambles and daring dealings. He loves the excitement of the market, with all the ups and downs, and the dangers as well as the chance to get rich quick. Born and raised in Chicago, he tried a number of jobs at home before finally going to New York to be near the market. And because he's much sought after by women, he dresses in the height of style, sparing no expense to look dashing and dapper.

Isadore Izzy A. G. Mann has often been described as a chameleon-like character, easily able to change and adapt to any situation, at any time. Thus he always dresses to fit the occasion. And because he's come to Montana on vacation and wants to relax, he doesn't care to talk about his work much - though he will admit to being employed by the government. Focused and determined, he's a hard worker, and never quits until he gets the job done right.

Stephanie Steph D. Rink is a prim and pretty prohibitionist, probably one of the most popular in the country. For her name is synonymous with sober. Often called Sister Steph, she's the founder of the Church of the Triple R - the Real Right Reformed. As a staunch activist and a prolific preacher, she's known to be quite vocal. And because she's always in the public eye, she's particular about her appearance, and often quick to follow the latest fashion fads.

Senator Vito D. Beale is a United States Senator from Illinois. A man of great power and passion, politics is in his blood, as he comes from a well-established and wealthy political family. Vito chooses his issues carefully and then fights for them to the finish. Yet he's also quite charming and cordial to the voters, and because he's got an important public image to uphold, he always dresses to the nines.

Mary Widdoe, is a strikingly beautiful and well-to-do young widow who just recently lost her husband. Now, wherever she goes, she carries the urn that holds the ashes of her late husband Ernie, for as she says: He made me everything I am. Her friends describe her as being wonderfully charming and a great listener. And as a grieving widow, Mary often wears black, though usually in the form of designer dresses.

This mystery game is especially fun for history buffs. Not only is the main storyline centered around Prohibition, but many of the characters are based (loosely) on actual historic figures. Izzy A. G. Mann, is a spoof on Izzy Einstein, one of the most famous Prohibition Agents of all. Of course, Princess Ann L. Retentov, is based somewhat on Annastasia Romanov.

This game also has some special features that others don't have. For instance, a few of the clues are to be hidden around the room, and this game includes an X that marks the spot, though I won't tell you where.

Costumes from the twenties are especially fun, as that was the era of flappers and men in wide-lapeled pinstriped suits. Also popular at the time was a train ride from Chicago to Montana, to enjoy the splendor of Yellowstone.

If you like history, you'll love this mystery!

This is a 2 player game on the last great horse cavalry campaign in history. The game covers the first 48 hours of the offensive launched by General Edmund Allenby's army on the 19th September 1918 in northern Palestine (now Israel).

The battle commenced just before dawn on the 19th after a brilliant deception operation that ensured that the Turks were out of place. It pitted a British army consisting mostly of Indian and Australian troops against the Ottoman Turks.

The speed at which the British army's mounted units moved and the distances they covered during the 48 hours and immediately afterwards, exceeded the best efforts of the Germans in any of their WW2 Blitzkriegs.

London Times
June 11, 1931
Lofty Aires, Duke of Airesborne, Killed In Attack Balloon Crash
Lofton Lofty Aires, twelfth Duke of Airesborne, and his son, Lord Lightern Aires, were killed yesterday while testing the duke's prototype attack balloon. Observers report that the balloon plummeted out of a cloudy sky into thick woods close to Airesborne Castle, killing both the duke and his son. The duke's brother, Drafton, succeeds to the title. Drafty, as he is popularly known, is in poor health and remains secluded at Airesborne Castle.
Lofton received much attention several months ago when he presented a proposal to Parliament to defend the coast of England with an army of armored balloons, constantly aloft, constantly alert, and threatening death to all intruders. Though the proposal was easily defeated, Lofton persisted in the study and development of the balloons, which he stated are critical to the well-being and security of our nation.
It was one such balloon that the duke and his son were testing on the morning of the crash. A spokesman for the Aires family declared, The duke had developed an advanced version of his armored balloon and was in the process of testing it when the accident occurred. Whether the crash was caused by a malfunction in the balloon or its weapons systems is not presently known.
Observers of matters concerning the nobility point out that it is not clear who will be Drafton's heir, since he has no children. In cases where the duke has no natural heir, he may nominate his heir from his immediate family, according to the Royal Grant of Privilege, bestowed by Queen Elizabeth when she created the Duchy of Airesborne in 1597. It is understood that the new duke has already made plans for a family council to invoke this privilege.

To celebrate this landmark moment in law enforcement, I have erected eight gallows on Main Street: seven for the execution of this thieving, murderous band, and one for good luck.

So, leave your affairs in order, and come join me in this triumphant celebration. The honor of your presence is required.

China, Eighth-Century:
The Autumn Moon Festival in eighth-century China is a time of relaxation and rejoicing. The frantic activities of the harvest have drawn to a close; crops are no longer at risk to weather and calamity; the peace of winter is about to descend. It is a time of transition. In the Chinese district of Chi-Ka and in its principal city of Chi-Ka-Go, the festival is an occasion for fireworks, parades, music and gaiety. Traditionally, the Festival of the Autumn Moon is also an occasion for reflection and thanksgiving. In many households, the entire family gathers and an elaborate feast is prepared. Effigies representing Happiness, Wealth and Long Life are displayed, and some families, recalling the ancient traditions, conclude the celebration with a bonfire in which the effigies are burned, their smoke rising to the heavens to signify gratitude and respect. Two of the wealthiest families of the district, the Wu and the Hoo families, have for many generations celebrated the festival together. This year both families' leaders, their women, and a few prominent guests will meet one day in advance of the festival to enjoy an elaborate feast, drink from the ceremonial Cup of Wisdom, recite poetry and contemplate the events of the past year. Children and less prominent family members will arrive the next day, the day of the festival, for feasting, revelry and, after sunset, lighting the Fire of Gratefulness. The site of the gathering and festival celebration this year will be the Hoo summer home at Hoo Hung Wu. A small group of islands situated in the middle of the great river Mi-Si-Pi, Hoo Hung Wu is co-owned by the Hoos and Wus, but only the Hoos have occupied it. They have built several buildings on the West Isle, including their summer home, Hoo House. East Isle is not occupied, though the Hoos maintain its roads and bridges. Hoo House is a magnificent dwelling in a pleasant forest setting. Several wings contain rooms for many guests and servants. Through the years the Hoos have also built smaller dwellings on West Isle where family members, or guests, who desire seclusion may find it.

Arthur E. Faxe, the eccentric entrepreneur and amateur archaeologist, sails this month for ancient Mesopotamia in search of human fossils and in the hope of proving the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. Faxe has chosen a region of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley known since ancient times as Vages for the site of his expedition. This area is distinguished by an immense and prominent boulder that can be seen for miles and is known locally as the Rock of Vages. A small cleft, or opening, at the base of the rock is the site of an unusual collection of fossils. The cleft, discovered in 1854 by French archaeologist, Henri Formie, is described in scientific literature as Rock of Vages, Cleft Formie. By arrangement with the local government, Faxe and his entourage will establish an extensive camp in an abandoned military fort near the archaeological site and overlooking the Tigris River.

Faxe advises, We are endeavoring to locate evidence in fossil form of the existence of an ancient human or near-human ancestor. I have spared no expense to see that my staff and guests are provided with the most modern of equipment necessary for their research and the essentials necessary for their comfort.

Purveyors of goods to the expedition advise that no less than fifty cases of fine wines and champagnes will accompany Faxe along with appropriate linen, silver and china, tables, chairs, canopies and tents, as well as a quantity of armaments for hunting and defense against bands of brigands which are known to roam the area. A domestic staff of thirty will be on hand, as well as an archaeological research team of seven.

The expedition, by arrangement with the Turkish government, will occupy an old fortress situated near the site of the dig. The fort, unused by the present government but once a key military post, is called Fort Ap Aachih.

During the game, all cards are dealt out for 2 to 4 players. During each turn, players turn over the top card of hid/her face down pile. The person with the winning card collects all of the cards and places them on the bottom of their pile. If there is a tie, cards are turned over until one player turns over a card that matches the original.

In a 3 or 4 player game, players play the player adjacent to them, taking turns, in a clockwise direction.

The game is won by the player who collects all of the cards.

M.U.S.C.L.E Stands for Millions of Unusually Small Creatures Lurking Everywhere.

A battle arena for your Muscles, with ten muscles!
Objective: Knock out all your opponent's muscles.

Playing the Game
1. Each player spins to see who goes first. The player who spins the higher number goes first.
2. Players take turns spinning the spinner and moving their M.U.S.C.L.E. creatures.
3. On each turn, a player spins the spinner, and them moves 1 or more of his creatures the same total number of spaces as the number just spun. A player can divide up his total move among as many creatures as he likes.
4. A player can move his creatures forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally in any combination.
5. A player can have up to 2 creatures on the same space at one time. You can move through a space with 2 of your creatures on it, but you can't stop there.

COMBAT
1. When you move one (or two) of you creatures onto a space occupied by one (or two) of your opponent's creatures, you begin a Combat.
2. During Combat, each player in turn spins the spinner once for each creature he/she has in battle. 
3. After both players have spun, the one with the most M's wins the Combat and gets to knock over 1 or 2 of the opposing creatures.
4. Once knocked over, the defeated creatures are out of the game. Players leave defeated creatures lying on the arena, but those creatures are not counted as occupying space, and may be moved around as necessary to make room for more Combat.
5. If both players spin the same number of M's, the battle is a tie and will continue after the player takes his/her turn moving.
6. Once each player has had one chance to do battle on every space where his/her creatures are in Combat, it becomes the next player's turn to move. This player takes his/her turn moving even if there was a tie in the battle or if both players still have creatures standing on the same space after the battle.
7. Play continues for the rest of the game with one player taking a turn moving, then a Combat round (if there are any Combat situations on the board), then the other player takes his/her turn moving, and so on.
8. You can be involved in any number of Combats at one time.
9. The last player with one or more M.U.S.C.L.E. creatures left standing wins the game!

There are stickers! You get a whole sheet of stickers with which  you can decorate your arena as well as your muscles.

When a ghost captures Ms Pac-Man, the ghost's player takes control of the titular character and removes his or her ghost from play; the former Ms Pac-Man player puts the ghost of his or her color into play.  Ghosts turn weak if an F2 is rolled on their die, or if Ms Pac-Man gobbles a Power Pellet (located at the four corners of the maze).  Ms Pac-Man can capture weak ghosts and gain an extra turn by doing so.

The first player to have his or her quadrant clear of pellets wins the game.

Changed into one of six types of animals (bats, spiders, snakes, etc), the players must gather the ingredients necessary to break the spell over them.

Taking turns to play, players move their pieces on the board based on the flicking of a spinner.  Ingredient discs are placed at the edges of the board and a player's piece must land exactly on the spaces to collect the items.  To break the spell over them, the creatures need to collect two different ingredients with their own symbols (e.g. a Turtle would require an Eye of Newt and a Fingernail of Newt).  If the spinner lands on the Wacky Wizard symbol, the player draws a Wizard Spell Card, which will turn his or her playing piece into another creature (and thereby changing his or her winning conditions).

The first player to break the enchantment over his or her piece wins and ends the game.

Players form 3-card sets of cards with picture cards of the Pac-Man or Ghost characters or number cards with dots, simulating the dots which Pac-Man gobbles up in the video game.

Players utilize individual game boards and place cards in open spaces as defined on each board. Picture cards are placed between two number cards. If the picture card is a Pac-Man card, the two number cards which bracket it are added together.

If the card is a Ghost card, the number card on the right is subtracted from the card on the left. So opponents are allowed to place ghost cards and number cards on opponents game boards in an attempt to hinder point scoring.

There is also a Pac-Man eating a Ghost card which acts as a multiplier between the two numbers.

Players play one card per turn, and the person who reaches 100 points if the winner.

An advanced version would subtract points from the players running total if the three card combination included a ghost and the subtraction resulted in a negative total.

4966,Jamie Swise Mystery Games: Murder by Proxy,1982,5,2,2,7,8,180,180,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Party Game ,Role Playing,"Early (predecessor?) parlor/play-acting game of hosting a murder/mystery.  There were at least six games in the Jamie Swise line, some of which were incorporated into the Milton Bradley Life of the Party line of mystery games.  This one...

Why did a nice lady like Mary Wrightwood suddenly stop publishing her weekly gossip rag and begin building a virtual empire, producing closet pornography?  We think it is a question which needs answering.  And if that burning question doesn't compel you, you might like to figure out who murdered her.

The case of characters is indeed curious: a right-wing megalomaniac, the cold-blooded co-publisher, a pompous author, a flower child, the degenerate son, an immensely virile handy man, the town's mayor and only plumber, and Mary's bible thumping ex-best friend.

The time is March, 1968.  Feelin' groovy?

The board is reversed and play begins. Neither player knows where the other has hidden his gold. The board is divided into a grid and a treasure detector is used to search for the buried treasure. The gold bags are magnetic and the treasure finder has a window that turns red when it has passed over treasure. A die is used to determine how many squares can be searched in a turn. The detector has a window that must be closed prior to searching for treasure. After moving the detector over a number of squares, the window is opened and if it has turned red, the detector has passed over a piece of your opponents treasure. By strategically searching the grid, a player is able to determine where the buried gold is hidden. A treasure map is provided to aid in remembering possible locations. The winner is the player that can locate all three treasure locations before his opponent. If you are not correct in all three locations, the opponent automatically wins.

4973,Pay Cards!,1969,5.62222,9,1.5,3,4,60,60,,Card Game Memory ,Memory,"Based on the obscure 1968-69 game show, an MC is chosen and shuffles a deck of twenty cards. The cards are inserted face-down into a numbered vinyl sheet. Players choose three numbers from the vinyl sheet and the cards are revealed. If a pair shows, the player must take all three cards. If not, the player may refuse the cards and they are turned face down and placed back onto the numbered sheet. After all cards are drawn, the hands are evaluated and the players given cash for pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, and for highest hand in the round. The player with the most money after three rounds plays the Jackpot Game and can earn additional money. The player with the most money after the Jackpot Game wins.

Three versions were apparently released: the original (Version I) has no Wild Cards and a red Jackpot spinner; the box has black copyright lettering, and the adult male wears a brown shirt. Some early copies of the release with Wild Cards (Version II) feature the same red Jackpot spinner and box design as Version I, but include the updated rules for using the Wild Card decks. Later Wild Card editions (Version III) have the updated rules and a black Jackpot spinner, plus the box has pink copyright lettering and the adult male wears a red shirt.

The game was given away as a consolation prize on the show. On the one circulating episode, late in the show's run (#209 of 260, taped 4/22/69), host Art James holds up the box with the brown-shirt male. This strongly suggests that Versions II and III each had a short print run.

4986,Elementary Watson,1978,5.875,8,0,2,7,120,120,,Memory Murder/Mystery Party Game ,Co-operative PlayMemoryStorytelling,"The perfect crime! This boxed game allows players to plan and try to solve it. No dice or other elements of chance.

One player (a referee) plots and writes the basics of a crime set in Victorian London. The other players (detectives) have little to work with at the start other than a description of what occurred, plus some information on the main characters. From that point on, it becomes a race against the clock since each crime must be solved within a set number of turns known only to the referee.

The mechanics are simple: detectives submit questions in writing to the referee. After collecting all of them, the referee answers them verbally. This means that the answers usually are understood only by the asking players. Questions must be very specific: for example, a player can check bank records only if he or she has spent part of a turn going to the bank. A mixed group of players will always have one or two ahead of the pack and one or two behind. Players also may pool information, but some always will hold back.

Elementary Watson is simple to play, difficult to master because it requires role-playing thinking. Players can choose areas of expertise, which might help them gain additional clues. A game board of London with neighborhoods and landmarks is included, but Elementary Watson can be played with paper and pencil.

4988,Equality,1978,4.92857,7,0,2,4,60,60,,Math Number ,Hand ManagementTile Placement,"Almost identical to Scrabble, but with numbers forming equations rather than letters forming words.

The game is played with tiles numbered 0 to 12 and tiles showing mathematical signs and parentheses. Each tile has a score (except the equality sign and parentheses). The most valuable numeral is 7 (because it has the least options for making an equation that equals 12 or less) and the most valuable signs are division and multiplication (again because there are less equations involving these operations that equal 12 or less). Like scrabble, squares on the board can increase your score, whether an individual tile or for the entire equation.

From the introduction:

Arrakhar's Wand is a fantasy boardgame of tactics and strategy for two players. One player (the sorcerer player) hides the wand in his realm and defends it with a group of evil sorcerers who can summon the aid of demons, orcs, and ghouls. The other player (the wizard player) invades with a force of good wizards, barbarians, dwarves, and elves, seeking to locate the wand and escape with it.

Before the play of the game begins, both players secretly design their forces. The board portrays the valley of the evil sorcerers, and on it the sorcerer player places the counters representing haunts (temples, ruins, and crypts), secretly recording one of them as the haunt in which the wand is hidden. The counters representing the sorcerers and their minions are then placed on the board, and on the sorcerer player's first turn they can begin summoning other evil units. The wizard player brings in the wizard units and their allies through one or more hexes along the valley border, and the struggle begins.

Each side can attack with spells and by physical combat. The wizard player should usually try to strike quickly, before the sorcerer player can organize an effective resistance. Only the sorcerer player gets a steady stream of reinforcements, in the form of wandering-orc counters, but the wizard player has the advantage of special attacking bonuses. To win, the wizard player must locate the wand and remove it from the sorcerers' valley through an entry/exit hex.

Players select campaign platforms and move from one province to another trying to elect enough Reichstag deputies to win. Components aren't much, but play includes issues such as fiscal austerity, Versailles treaty, law and order. Nazi and Communist party players have street mobs options.

No incentive is provided for cooperation among players, giving the Nazi Party player a slight edge. If no one accumulates enough deputy points after three elections to win, players may assume that President Hindenburg restores the monarchy, or continue playing until winner is declared.

The game is comprised of a 28-page softcover digest, with a map and markers sheet.

Be the first player to get your monkey across the gator-infested swamp to Great Banana Island, and you win.  But whatever you do, Don't Feed The Gators!

The path to the Island goes across the backs of the four gators; when a player lands on a gator's snout, his monkey is put in the gator's gaping jaws, and the naughty red monkey is then placed on the gator's neck.  This sometimes makes the gator's jaws snap shut --and you must start all over with a fresh monkey.

The monkey spaces on the board allow you to swap your place with another player's, so you're always in the race, even when far behind.  The gator spaces allow you to designate a monkey to advance to the next gator jaws in front of him --sometimes you'll get rid of the competitor, sometimes you'll help him get closer to the finish!

It's all done with magnets.   ;-)

The map covers all major European and West-Asian countries ranging from Britain and France in the west to Persia and Russia in the east. Players maneuver armies, corps, and naval squadrons while engaging in mobilization, combat, and diplomacy.

There are seven historical and one hypothetical scenario, plus a campaign game that links all of them into one massive 72 turn game. (One turn equals one month.)

Each player begins with a set amount of resources and must manage them properly to gain victory. Run out of money (National Resource Credits) before the others and you're probably out of the game. Similarly, players have fixed mobilization pools from which to draw on to create new units. You can end up with having enough money to outfit a new infantry division but without any more young men to wear those uniforms! There are no endless supplies in this game to keep building unit after unit after unit. Makes for a very challenging and interesting gaming situation.

5056,D.A.K.,1982,5.75,10,0,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Action Point Allowance SystemSecret Unit Deployment,"Strategic level game covering the battle for North Africa during WWII. The key feature of this game is its operation points which represent supply. These points are expended when units move or fight and also just to maintain a unit's existence. They're moved from the ports to the forward battle area and require record keeping.

This game's supply system portrays the situation that existed. Even if you're just digging in and awaiting an attack, you still need supplies flowing to your troops to feed (and water) them. Also, because all units must be able to trace supply to exist, players are rewarded well when successfully able to cut off enemy units from their rear areas. You can even capture enemy supply depots that are located too close to the front.

It can be linked with the game La Regia Marina, also published by Simulations Canada. When playing this way, the available number of operations points is based on how well you manage your fleets and convoys in La Regia Marina rather than the fixed supply schedule that comes with D.A.K.

One full map is divided into Eastern map and Western map.  The whole map covers from Damascus to Casabranca.  This is one of the widest map of this theatre, I think.

The game ends when all of a player's pieces are capped or captured.  If keeping score, captured pieces are worth 3, capped pieces 1.

Exploration elements work well and ensure no two games are the same. Dressing the board with the rather fiddly little tiles each time a new part of the maze is uncovered can become tedious. The cumulative effect of collected weapons can render a lucky player almost invincible very quickly, with the chimp warriors soon becoming superfluous and little more than an irritation.

Jumps aren't allowed.  A Push occurs when an Escort arrives short of another piece (Princes can't Push); what happens is that the Escort's remaining steps are transferred to the pushed piece --which may be an opposing piece or your own Prince.  The pushed piece's move must be in a straight line, in the direction dictated by the collision.  When the straight line isn't possible, deflection occurs as indicated in the rules.  Compound pushes can occur, when a pushed piece in turn collides with another.

On a 7x9 chessboard, the central 3x3 area is marked off as the Arena.  Each player sits at a long edge and starts with his nine frogs (hollow plastic figurines, 7 cm along their largest dimension) filling that row.  All frogs move like Chess knights.  Light moves first.  Capture is by landing on an opposing frog and is not mandatory.  The object of the game is to line up three frogs horizontally, vertically or diagonally in the Arena in such a way that the opponent cannot break it up (by capture) on his next move.  A draw occurs when both players are down to two frogs.

In advanced play, a frog that captures gets to move again, sort of like in Checkers.  Other variations allowed include different starting dispositions (any can be used as long as they are player-symmetrical).  Finally, the alternate win rule states that you can also win by reducing the opponent to two frogs.

Although the game is basically a simple collection game for the young child, it is made even more entertaining by the dialogue (suitable for early readers) from each of the animal characters.  Reading is not required, only optional.  The game is based on the characters created by Ruth Lerner Perle and Jacquelyn Reinach and illustrated by Richard Hefter.

The board is 12x12, divided in 16 fields of 3x3, with field centres specially marked.  The pieces come in four colours and each set consists of a cylinder, four triangles and six squares.

All games but Line up use the whole 12x12 grid as a playing area. Line Up only uses the center positions of the 16 3x3 fields to effectively yield a 4x4 grid of playing positions.

Solitaire Sly is for 1 player and is a variation on the old puzzle of removing pieces by selected jumps. The game starts in 6x6 grid of pieces, but pieces can jump outside the 6x6 area using the whole 12x12 board if desired.

Sniggle is a racing game for 2-4 players.

Line Up is an alignment two-player game played on a 4x4 grid with each player having two squares, two triangles and one cyclinder of his color.

Empire is an abstract two-four player wargame of sorts.

Blockade (two players) is a distant relative of Hnefatafl; each player tries to have his king escape whilst blocking the other's with his guards.

Gateway, finally, is a 2-4 player game where each tries to enter all his pieces by forming alignments with opposing pieces.

There are two levels of play.  In the introductory game, the sharks circle around the outer board, attacking each other when they catch up or from the Circle or Attack spaces.  After each fight, the winner takes 5 prey tokens from the loser.  Starve and you lose a turn.  Other spaces make you lose or gain prey tokens, and the Feeding Frenzy space causes a fight royale.

In the full game, the inner part of the board represents the prey population; when your movement allows, you can dip into and out of this part of the board to eat prey.  Prey reproduces periodically, replenishing the inner board.  Whoever fed the most after 10 to 20 rounds (depending on the number of players) wins.  But if you're too greedy and you wipe out all prey, all sharks starve and everyone loses!

Players are to collect five experience tokens and one skill chip from each of the seven intuitive areas.  The game includes hundreds of props for the different intuitive skills, which are as follows:

Pattern Perception: name a word which is printed in a very blurred fashion.

Psycho-Osmosis: Determine the meaning of a selected Hieroglyph.

Analysis: Select the two points of a large maze which are connected.

Imagination: Draw an abstract image card and name four things it could be (may require a vote from fellow players).

Connection: Draw two abstract image cards and state how they could be connected.

Recall: Look at an image and recall five or more of the eight items depicted.

Recognition: Look at an image card, then turn it over and point out the three images which weren't on the face.

The trick here is that all these actions have a 12-second time limit.  No analysis paralysis.  Players pretty much have to shoot from the hip or, that is to say, use their intuition.

A second edition was published and the meta-game of this edition was to intuitively figure out the exact date and time of that release.  First 100 correct guessers were to receive a limited 2nd edition.

Imagine the fun! Alone, or with a friend, or with a whole party of people, players can reveal their innermost thoughts on love, politics, or any other subject. Kreskins ESP game will give you the opportunity to reveal your ESP powers and explore the outer frontiers of the human mind in two scientifically proven ways.

Similar to an Ouija board, this game includes several tricks and a magic pendulum which can be used to determine answers to yes/no questions and even spell out words.

From correspondence with Kreskin, December 2010:

Regarding your inquiry about the Kreskin ESP game, yours truly designed the game.  As far as the artwork for the box, the Milton Bradley people had their staff do that.  At one point, the amount of sales was over a million and it approached two million.
 Thank you for your interest about the game.  It became a very popular showcase, as I played it with many people on television, including Johnny Carson, Mike Douglas, and Merv Griffin, as the pendulum proved to be a fascinating phenomena.
 With all my best thoughts,
Kreskin

The tri-colour hex board has a 9 hex wide starting rank, to allow for a third bishop (for the third colour). Otherwise, rules are identical to orthodox chess.

The well-defined wooden playing pieces are black, white and red, although in my set, the black (really dark brown) and red (sort-of mid brown) are a little too similar for comfort.

Children who have recently learnt to play Chess will absolutely love this development and experienced adult players will relish the challenge.

Three colour draughts pieces are also provided, but this feels more messy and forced, than the Chess varient.

The game concept is that the point values are on the board instead of the letter tiles. This supposedly permits a more liberal use of the letters and helps develop full word power and effective strategy.

Besides that major departure from Scrabble, there are a number of minor differences, such as the number of tiles held on the rack, and the bonus for using all tiles.

In this game, the objective is to move along your pawn's lane from one end of the board and back before anyone else does.  Along that path are 8 different pictures, repeated over and over, and each person's path is slightly different (at least the sequence of the images varies, but the same images are used).

Each player also holds a hand of cards and their goal is to collect cards with the same images as the one their pawn is resting on.  That part of the game is pretty much the same as the classic game, Pit.  Players trade cards unseen, in any combinations (unlike Pit) and all that must happen is that an equal number of cards must be given and taken.

When the timer runs out, move your pawn forward the number of spaces equal to the number of matching cards in your hand.  At that point, most of the time, you will be sitting on a different image, so another round of trading is necessary to redistribute your hand.

The board consists of three stacked surfaces, each looking like a progressively smaller Morris board.  They are numbered from top to bottom.

The first play phase is placement.  The dice dictate where you can appear.  For example, a throw of one and two allows either one piece on board two, or two pieces on board one.  Placements are mandatory.  You may be forced to pass if no placement is possible.

Once all of your pieces are placed, you use the dice to move them (the transition turn may feature a placement and a move).  Here too the dice dictate the moves: a throw of one and two allows either one piece to move on board two, or two pieces on board one, or one piece from board two to board one (or vice-versa).  Moves are mandatory.

As in Morris, every time a three-piece alignment is formed (including vertical ones), this is a Mill and one opposing piece of the miller's choice is removed.  Pieces in mills are protected.  Multiple mills may be formed by a single move.  You win by grinding the opponent down to two pieces.

The four-player game is a partnership game.

Cards come in three types; Artists, Thinkers and Leaders, each with a picture and short biography of an appropriate historical character, and in two colors, red if born before 1700 and yellow if afterwards.   The Code Master chooses a pattern for cards to be laid down in incorporating color, type or both, either from the Code cards supplied or by inventing his own.  Players, including the Code Master, then take it in turns to play cards from their hands and are told whether the cards are correct or not.  If a player deduces the pattern before running out of cards he scores; otherwise the Code Master scores.

The central hex is known as the throne; most Agon boards feature alternating colors of hexes in rings, starting from the six hexes surrounding the throne. Each player has one queen piece and six guard pieces. These all have alternating starting positions on the board's outer ring. Players take turns moving their pieces forward (or laterally) towards the center of the board; pieces may be captured by an opponent, if they are surrounded on two sides in a straight line. The captured player must then relocate his piece to the outer ring of the board. To win the game, a player must have his queen on the throne and surrounded by all six of his guards.

Tiles are placed on the board as it is explored; initially each player is looking for the rooms containing their equipment (Key, allowing teleportation between various points, Weapon and Armour). On the way they encounter Monsters to defeat. Once they have found their equipment players make their way to the center of the board to challenge the Dragon; defeating him wins the game. Players can have combat with each other if they land on the same space and can barter items with each other.

Success is dependent on your rooms turning up somewhere near you early on in the game. There is a limited amount of decision making re the routes and which is the best way to put tiles.

The components are quite attractive and sturdy.

5170,Tri-Umph,1989,4.66667,3,3,2,2,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Pattern BuildingPoint to Point Movement,"This game is distantly related to the Mill game or Nine Men's Morris, in that the object is to make alignments of three pieces: each such alignment created removes one opposing piece (miller's choice).  You win when you've reduced the opponent to two pieces or put him in such a bind that he cannot move.  If both players become immobilized, a draw occurs.

The 56 board is set up by both players by plunking down each of their 12 pieces alternately.  Strategy is crucial during this phase.  The only restriction is that alignments of three cannot be formed during this phase.  Once all pieces are set up, on your turn you move one of your pieces one space horizontally or vertically (diagonals aren't allowed or considered).

Strategies are alluded to but not explained in the short rules.  Shan Ruwa (to drown) consists of setting up so as to force the opponent to place in positions that will aid the starting player and drown the opponent.  Conversely, Turi (to push) prevents the starting player from forming alignments and makes his opening move bad for him.

A mill is called here Doki (galloping horse).  It is a combination of five pieces such that you form an alignment on each leg of the back-and-forth motion of the fifth piece.  The game terms are all taken from Hausa, a West-African language (presumably the first author's maternal tongue).

     6 TAMSK-potentials for each player


See the project GIPF wiki page for more details on the potentials' powers.

The TAMSK-potential is the first additional piece of project GIPF. It is named after the game TAMSK and offers new ways to play GIPF.  The TAMSK-potential can grant its owner an extra move during a turn.

A clarifying note from designer Kris Burm about the GIPF Project expansion Set #1 and the TAMSK potentials included with the TAMSK game:

As you maybe know, enclosed in the TAMSK box are 3 white and 3 black TAMSK-potentials. These are samples. You need a minimum of 3 potentials of each color to get a feeling of how they change a game of GIPF. The GIPF Project Expansion Set #1 contains 12 TAMSK-potentials; 6 potentials per color is the standard number to play with. The kit is meant to give players who like playing with the potentials the possibility to get more potentials without needing to buy a second game of TAMSK. That aside, it is also meant to serve those who want to find out what potentials are all about without needing to purchase TAMSK.

This is part of project GIPF.

The game board is illustrated with scenes of the French Revolution in the late 18th century: the pictures from the starting point to the end point follow the course of the event.

Players take turns to roll the dice and move their tokens according to the total of the dice.  Landing on certain spaces could mean advancing the token further up the path, losing turns, or going back to the starting point.  If a token lands on a chicken space, it gets to double its move (and double it again if it still lands on a chicken space).

The game ends when a player's token lands exactly on the end point, making him or her the winner.  If the movement would overshoot the end point, the token has to backtrack the excess amount.

Initially, all pieces move just one square. A square piece moves horizontally and vertically, a circle moves diagonally and a cross combines the two moves.  Opposing pieces are captured by landing on top of them to form towers. A tower may move as many squares as pieces it contains. Power squares in each corner allow unrestricted movement. Once a tower reaches the height of six pieces, it can no longer move or be captured.  The game is won when black or white owns three towers of 6 pieces.

Both offensive and defensive strategies are possible and players should remember that a tower of 6 cannot move or be captured, but it can still block!

It contains 57 cards, most of them new (and a few duplicates of cards from the base game). It was later split into the smaller expansions Wissenschaft & Fortschritt (Science  Progress) and Ritter und Händler (Knights  Merchants).

For the tournament game, both players need a copy of the base game and of this tournament expansion. Before the game, each player builds his own deck from the available cards: a starting hand of 3 cards, and another 30 cards that form 4 draw stacks. The event deck is constructed by five fix cards, and another 4 cards choosen by each player.
Gameplay is unchanged from the base game, except that each player only draws from his own supply stacks.

As a variant, rules for an expanded base game without deck building are included, for which only one copy of base game and expansion is needed.

Once you've garnered two trophies, you can enter the National Finals, at the end of the game track.  Once there, you enter events repeatedly, until the entire Finals purse is gone.  You must therefore decide whether to stop at every rodeo on the way to the Finals (which will garner money and trophies but leaves the Finals purse vulnerable to faster players) or charge there as quickly as possible (assuming the prerequisites have been achieved).

Half of the game features the theme which is where the players hear a common word of phrase used on popular culture such as cut to the chase or spam and then fabricate the origins of those phrases to fool the other players into guessing their false derivation.  The other half is split into three different mini games all built around the same key phrases.  Two involve trying to guess the popular word or phrase by either charades/drawing or talking about the phrase but not using any of the words in the actual question.

The last part involves pure chance where a random event migh help or hinder the current player slightly.  Winning the round in these various activities will earn cards with an individual letter which eventually spells out D-E-R-I-V-A-T-I-O-N.

The first player to do this wins the game.

The firsts are born in bursts, and the best of the rest are obsessed. This is how I defined that illusive state, the 'open' or 'perfect' game, in 1976. Since perfection is all but impossible to achieve, I decided to design all-inclusive or 'peri-' games, Jigsol' is the first of the series.

Designed to play with more versatility and challenge than any other word game, Jigsol' is ideal for any player who can spell 24 words or more. For those who are curious, a Jigsol is a 'jigsaw solution'. Jigsol is a legal word when playing this game.
-E.M.W.

Each player starts with 25 letters printed on hexagons, the timer is started and each player tries to form an interlocking word puzzle. When the time is up each player calculates his points. When all 25 letters are used a player receives a delta mark on the score sheet (small triangle) and 25 points. The game ends when someone gets 5 or more deltas, or at 200, 500 or more points.

The two white rings (lanes) allow movement limited only by the presence of other pieces. The three blue rings (moats) cannot be crossed in one go; you must stop on them. The lone exceptions are the four blue hexes on your side of the board --you may cross them freely, but your opponent cannot. The thirteen red hexes (gates), finally, are the game goals; you win by occupying five of these in a straight line. To enter a gate, you must start adjacent to it (except for the two gates adjacent to your base). Entering a gate (other than the two base ones) gives you a bonus move. Occupied gates are the only occupied spaces that can be jumped.

A hex is secured (the opponent cannot enter it) if surrounded by three or more of your pieces. Securing a hex captures any piece that happens to lie there (it is removed from the game and you get a bonus move). Finally, the fifth gate of any triangular set is secured if you occupy the first four. This is called triangulation.

The rulebook also supplies handicapping suggestions, optional rules for a more challenging game, and explains how to support team play.

The board comprises a raised S-shaped track with baize-coated recesses for throwing the dice. The poker-chip sized pieces, embossed with scorpions, also stack neatly onto the impressively designed and attractive playing surface.

The race starts with players entering their pieces onto the yellow track. After 18 spaces, when the end of the initial S has been reached, players double-back on themselves, taking the black track to return home. The twist lies in 
that a scorpion may sting another, not just by landing on the same space, but also by landing on an adjacent space on the other coloured track. This enables a player to hinder opponents or to boost his own position by switching scorpions onto the other track.

Unfortunately, the rather minimalist rules supplied do not cover every gameplay eventuality. In particular, the knock-on effect that occurs frequently on a congested board, where a stung scorpion may inadvertently sting another is not explained in a satisfactory manner.

The center of the board has an outline map of the United States with the Electoral College votes of each state marked. The map divides the states into six color-coded regions.

Players move around the edge of the board on a 64-square track. Most of these are individual states, and landing on one allows a player to take the state if uncommitted or to contest it if held by another player. To contest, he rolls 2D6, and on a 2-6 wins the state, while on 7-12 the challenged party gets to take a state in the same region from a challenger.

There is a deck of Political Fortune cards which are collected on eight of the spaces. These can be positive or negative: losing a state or a turn or even all states in a region; or winning states and becoming a favorite son in a state, which confers unchallengeable ownership of that state for the rest of the game.

When a player collects the majority of the states in one of the six regions, he takes over all the electoral college votes for the region and all of those states are locked (can no longer be challenged). First player to 270 Electoral College votes wins.

5283,Penta Go,1971,0,0,0,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area EnclosureRoll / Spin and Move,"The game is played by two players or two teams of two players and is a curious amalgam of Go and Monopoly.  The object is to eliminate the opponent's stones.  There is an outer circuit with roughly every other square being a castle property, the others bearing various instructions (Monopoly-style).  The inner board consists of 10x10 lines enclosing 81 squares, twenty of which are castles in five colored groups of four.

You start with your Knight (pawn piece) on the Start space and a box of fifty stones (men).  The third box is the King's Treasury (bank).  On your turn you roll, advance the Knight accordingly, and then add a stone to the central board.  Stones are placed on intersections, as in Go, and mark possession of the territory surrounding the intersection.  Taxes and commands on the outer board are ignored until the Knight has completed two circuits.

The outer board has spaces with named castles; when you land there, you pay the castle's owner a land use tax of two to seven stones, depending on the castle (the central one is worth more, for example).  You own a castle by encircling it (as closely as possible).  You control territory by encircling it.  You can also trace a line across the board, which then gives you control of the smaller of the two parts thus created.  Capture is as in Go: an encircled set of stones dies if it does not have any eyes --empty spaces inside it and the encircling enemy.

Stones can be exchanged freely, so you could, for example, sell captured opponent stones back to him in exchange for treasury stones in order to pay a fine.  If you absolutely run out of stones, you can take some off the board.

PARATROOPER is the second module in the ASL series, which means it is not a complete game unto itself. Players will need boards 1-4 of SQUAD LEADER and the ASL rules to play all eight scenarios included herein. However, all other components necessary to play the game are enclosed-absolutely no other purchase is necessary.

PARATROOPER has been specially designed as an Introductory Module for those SQUAD LEADER players contemplating a switch to ASL to provide an inexpensive medium for them to sample the rich delights of the ASL game system without requiring the purchase of the full Russian/German OB found only in the first ASL Module: BEYOND VALOR. Yet, the countermix in PARATROOPER serves as a supplement to the BEYOND VALOR components, rather than an unneeded duplication of those counters should the player decide to expand his ASL collection.

Included are board 24, featuring a village in a valley, and two countersheets.

Due to the special nature of the fighting that comprised the airborne invasion of Normandy, the eight scenarios emphasize infantry encounters with little in the way of vehicles, ordnance, OBA, or the more detailed rules which constitute the entire spectrum of ASL.

This goes hand-in-hand with the introductory nature of PARATROOPER.
PARATROOPER is not a complete game; ownership of ASL and boards 1-4 is required.

The second module for Advanced Squad Leader. This one is an introductory module, geared towards those gamers who are experienced with Squad Leader.

The first edition, published by Avalon Hill, included mapboard 24 and ASL 1st edition rules Chapter K Training Manual. The first four boards from Squad Leader are needed to play the scenarios included.

The second edition, printed by Multiman Publishing, adds mapboards 2  4 (from the original Squad Leader) but deletes the Chapter K Training Manual as it is now included in the ASL 2nd edition rulebook.

Only Britain, sheltered by her fleet and the English channel, stands fast before the swaslika. To the East, German panzers stand stalled by winter at the very gates of Moscow. However, the Third Reich is nearing its high water mark for the tide is about to turn. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor will usher the United States into World War II and seal the doom of the Thou sand Year Reich. American industry will supply the Allied armies with vast quantities of war material, and a fresh, new breed of fighting man will enter the fray against Hitler's tested Wehrmacht. The G.I. will become the anvil on which the victory over a bled white Wehrmacht is forged.

G.I.; ANVIL OF VICTORY allows you to command the full gamut of American fighting men as they drive the Germans from Africa, Sicily, Italy, Normandy, and back across the Rhine and into Germany itself. G.I. adds the complete American arsenal of rrgmlng men ana machines to your SQUAD LEADER repertoire, while expanding and enriching the most acclaimed historical gaming system yet devised. Can the greater numbers and superior-gunnery control systems of the American Shermans compensate for the more lethal guns of the feared German Panther? G.I. provides a gripping and graphic answer unmatched by any book.

But G.I. offers far more than just American tanks. It contains more components than any of the preceding games in the series. The entire game system has been streamlined while enhancing realism even further. German, British, and even French infantry counters have been revised to enhance unit identification, add inherent smoke values, and more clearly distinguish the differences between squads, crews, and half-squads.

In each game you get: 

    1040 two-sided 1/2 die-cut counters representing the infantry combatants of the European Theatre from 1942-45 .
    528 two-sided 5/8 die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the U.S. in World War II 
    Illustrated scenario cards for situations 33-46 
    Five additional 8 x 22 geomorphic mapboard sections increasing the possible terrain configurations many told and introducing several new terrain types [mapboard 8, 12, 13, 14, 15]

If you move onto a space with a coaster still on it, you take the coaster.  Then the next player goes, bidding against the player to his left.  As the bidding goes round and round, eventually each player has used all 6 of his bid-chips.  They then take them all back into their hand, and start fresh.  First player to get to space 25 then gets to take all the remaining coasters still on the board.

The player (or partnership) with the most coasters wins the game.

The turning point of the American war in Vietnam occurred during the first months of 1968, a period framed by the Tet Offensive as well as the campaign featured here, the fighting for Khe Sanh. The region just below North Vietnam, Quang Tri province, was especially vulnerable to threats from the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and across the Laotian border. For almost a year the US Marines had been fighting to stabilize the DMZ region.

Khe Sanh was the outpost intended to block and seal off the NVA's access to Quang Tri from the west, from Laos where many of their base areas were located. Other fortifications barred the DMZ. In early 1968 the NVA countered by assembling large forces around Khe Sanh, threatening a battle for the place. The American command focused its attention upon Quang Tri, and even more, Khe Sanh. The ensuing campaign pitted South Vietnamese and American forces, at the peak of their combat efficiency, against a tough NVA enemy. At stake was victory in the Vietnam War.

Hegemon is an operational simulation for two players which recreates the efforts of Athens and Thebes to withstand the Makedonian pursuit of Hellenic hegemony in the crucial years of 339-338 BC. One player commands the forces of Athens, Thebes, and their allies (the Hellenes), while the other controls the Makedonian army and its allies (the Makedonians).

The uneasy and uncertain partnership between Athens and Thebes is based upon the tenuous agreement that Athens will be dominant at sea and Thebes will be dominant on land. Knowing that Makedon can offer only limited challenges to the Athenians at sea, Philip II of Makedon chooses to wage a land war, ostensibly to enforce a ruling of the Delphic Amphiktyony against the Lokrian city of Amphissa.

In the first part of the game, you bid on robot bodies, armor, and upgraded weapons. Each player has a hand of cards that are numbered from 0 to 3, plus a Battle card. To get a body, you play a war-like card game, blindly drawing one of your cards. The player with the highest card gets to choose from the four bodies available. The loser chooses from what is remaining. Next, the players bid for accessories, the armor and weapons. The loser of the body choice gets to choose the first accessory up for bid. Each robot has a specific set of armor that will fit it. If you lose the bid on it, you are at a severe disadvantage. However, your opponent will have had to use up bid cards and thus will have less for later auctions. You also can prevent your opponent from completing his robot by playing your Battle card in an auction. This gives the item up for bid to your opponent, but ends all bidding for accessories and sends you to the next stage of the game.

Once you have a robot and accessories for it, it is time to battle in the arena. You build your robot on a plastic arm that has a wheel control and trigger on the other side. Robots face off on any flat surface. Battles have a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots robots feel, as the goal is to maneuver your robot where it can knock off your opponent's armor and expose a release button. Hit the release button and the opponent's robot pops off and you win the round. the first player to win four rounds wins the game.

Five animals (giraffe, cheetah, lion, zebra, rhino) are placed on the board at the various watering holes. Players throw a single oversized die to determine the action of each move: five of the die faces depict the five animal hide patterns of the animal figures, and the sixth die face shows a blue raindrop. When the player's roll brings up one of the fur patterns, the player moves the corresponding animal clockwise around the board to the next watering hole. When the die roll shows the raindrop symbol, all players remove one raindrop from his watering hole for every animal that is standing at that player's watering hole at that time.

The winner is the player who feeds the most thirsty animals by being the first to run out of raindrops.

It is an Empires of History game, which utilizes a D10 variant of the Axis & Allies gaming system. The Arab Israeli Wars includes 2 game scenarios; one for the 1967 War and one for the 1973 War.
 In the 1967 war, Israel must strike out quickly to wrestle the Sinai region away from Egypt and deal deadly blows against Syria and Jordan before the weight of the superior Arab numbers can fully be mobilized, and before Iraq joins in the war against them. Israel's ready reserves gives them an edge in calling up their armies and they have to leverage that for everything it is worth.

In the 1973 war, Israel begins play in control of the Sinai, Palestine, and the Golan Heights. The Arab powers must hit Israel hard and fast, trying to overrun Israel's border armies before Israel can mobilize its then-superior military might.

The Arab Israeli Wars is a fast paced game (some games can be concluded in as little as a hour) historically portraying these two middle east conflicts. Optional rules for land mines and the use of the nuclear weapons adds additional game play variety.

This offering by Mattel was recommended by Games Magazine way back in 1978. Two to four players each choose a set of colored marbles which are placed on the board and then shaken up with an opaque lid on top. The board is configured unevenly so that it forms a diagonal grid where the marbles can nestle. There's a great deal of luck involved since marbles may land favorably for some players and not others.

The object is simply to move your marbles one spot at a time in any diagonal direction to arrange your twelve marbles into lines of three or more, while blocking your opponents in the process.

Players get rid of their marbles by dropping them into the chutes on top of the tomahawks without letting more marbles fall off of them. This is very tricky to do because when you place a marble on one tomahawk, the weight of the marble pushes that tomahawk down while pushing the opposite tomahawk up and there are openings along the edges of the chutes which allow some marbles to fall back out.

This game requires some weight distribution reasoning and deduction and it is not as simple as it looks.

Any good ol' boy can put the hammer down, but maneuvering through the pack, watching your tire wear and fuel consumption and knowing the limits of your machine are tricks only the best drivers can hope to master. When Stock Car Saturday Night is over, will you be up on Victory Lane making a hot date with the Performance Princess, or down in the garage gettin' greasy under a broken stock car?

The game includes printable PDF files for full-color counters, a two-section mapboard, turn and lap markers, and 160 strategy cards as well as a simple three-page rulesheet. Also included is a unique cardstock construct in the MicroTactix tradition -- a paperback-sized full-color slipcase storage box you print and assemble to hold all the game components, allowing you to display and transport your game after it is printed.

Place the board in the middle of the table. Each player gets a sight barrier which he places before himself. Also the players get a landing craft. The landing craft is placed on the scoring track.

The map tiles are mixed face-down, and an arbitrary card is put face-up on an arbitrary field of the game board. The card is oriented so that the two numbers each point to one of the sides of the board with the holes. Based on this tile, the coordinate stones are populated onto each side. First place the number corresponding to the tile, then fill in the rest of the side using numbers one through five consecutively. Players put their treasure chests, map tiles and guards behind their sight screen.

Each player has one of the following possibilities during his turn:
- Take an open map tile and place it behind their screen;
- Take a free guard and place it behind their screen;
- Place a map tile or tiles on the board;
- Place Treasure Chests on the board;
- Place Guards on the board.

If a player scores he or she moves the corresponding landing craft on the scoring track. Players achieve points by placing map tiles, revealing buried treasures, guarding the treasure once discovered, and for ending the game. The game ends when a player has nothing behind their screen at the beginning of their turn.
The winner is the player whose landing craft at the end of the game is furthest advanced on the score chart.

Since the leading bike gets first play the next turn, there is plenty of opportunity for blocking and jockeying for position before the end of the final lap.

5440,Eliminator,2003,0,0,0,2,2,10,10,,Dice Fighting ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and MoveSimultaneous Action Selection,"Based on Chess, but with less tactical requirements of the player.

Players have eight pieces - six soldiers, a King and a Kings Guard. The player starts by rolling a dice, giving him a number that is the maximum moves that player can make during his turn. He may move any pieces he wants as long as their moves add up to or below the total rolled on the dice. All pieces move once for every dot on the dice except the King's Guard, who moves twice, never less, for each spot used.

This is played out on a chess board with a blue and a red team. Blue moves first. The objectives are either to kill the other King whilst protecting one's own (Eliminator) or just to kill every enemy piece on the board (Speed Eliminator). To perform a kill, your piece must leap frog another. If your piece passes over another - whichever team it belongs to - it is dead and removed from the board.

Each piece has a forward facing arrow on its head except the King's Guard. These show the directions the pieces are allowed to move in. The KG may move in any direction, but for the other pieces to change direction, the directional dice (which tells you which way to turn) must be rolled instead of the movement dice. The result of the roll must be adhered to with one of your pieces changing direction accordingly.

If a piece reaches the enemy's side, it recieves a cap that allows it to move in any direction. This cap is also a shield which can 'die' instead of the piece, should the piece be killed. If the piece lands infront of the King, the cap may be transfered, but the piece must remain in the direction it faces when the cap is removed.

Mindware has a new release of this game and here is their description:
Up for Grabs! Is a quick-to-learn language building game. Hexagon-shaped letter tiles are revealed one at a time. Be the first player to see a word and grab the letter tiles, and the word is yours. Letters will continue to be turned over; at any time, a player can take over your word by adding at least one new letter to it. At the end of the game, words with more than four letters are tallied, and the person with the highest score wins! Includes 100 tiles, score pad and instructions.

The map shows the country, divided into two zones; the A zone is harder to get to and out of, so exploration permits are cheaper --because only big deposits are likely to be money makers.  Some of the A zone lots are offshore.

What you can do during your turn is driven by the outer track.  Eventually, you'll buy permits, conduct seismic exploration, drill (also a form of exploration), place reservoir markers for oil or gas.  Random events intervene, and nationalization occurs now and then.

The game has a definite educational bent to it.

Eurohit is an enjoyable and challenging card game for 3-6 players aged 10 years and upwards.  The rules are easy to understand and allow play to be friendly or cunningly crafty, depending on your style of play and the group of players.

The object of the game is to score 500 points (or over) by visiting as many European Cities as possible whilst keeping one step ahead of the Hit Man.  However, as the Hit Man, you can score points off the other players.

You will soon master the rules, and some, but not maybe all, of the possible stategies, but if you do, there are optional rules to alter the play to make it an easier or harder, shorter or longer game.

The game has a homebrew quality about it (comparable to Cheapass Games products, but in a nice carton).  Noteable for being acquired by Avalon Hill and being reissued as the much maligned Assassin, featuring better components but adds some rather odd tweaks and revisions to the rules.

On your turn, you roll the five dice (each of which is 0-0-0-0-1-1).  Each die that comes up 1 earns you a cap and the opportunity to roll again.  If you choose to do so, you roll the 0 dice in the hope of getting more 1s...But if you roll no 1s, you lose your turn and any 1s rolled previously.  Hence the Temptation.  If you manage to get five 1s, you place five caps (see below) and take another turn.

The caps won must be placed in a straight orthogonal line, adjacent to at least one previously placed cap.  You lose the caps won if you can't place them.  You may even cap off part of another player's grid --this helps him somewhat, but may make the rest of his grid harder to cap off, by breaking up the pattern.

When playing multiple rounds, the winner of a round scores the other players' remaining cap spaces.

Ships come in four types: Astrobase (strongest, initially carries everything else), Fighter (fast but weak), Battle-Cruiser (medium strength, carries Laser Gun and Force Field Transmitter) and Carrier (slowest and weakest, transports the Uranium [NOT the Fighters] --may steal the cargo of another Carrier).  Each is rated in Offensive Potential, Defensive Potential and Motion Potential (which is also the Firing Range).  Laser Guns are immobile firing platforms; Force Field Transmitters are obstacles and may be combined to erect linear barriers (when their separation is at most 3 hexes).

Natural obstacles include Magnetic Storm Zones, Asteroids (fixed and mobile) and a Black Hole.  Combat uses a classic odds-ratio table (CRT), with possible results being destruction, breakdown (out of action for a turn) or deviation (moving the ship 3 hexes) --the aggressor may suffer as well as the defender, depending on the odds.

The basic premise of the game is to acquire 10 virus-free Object cards that represent computer resources such as Graphics, Software, Web Pages, Games, Documents, and Email. Action cards provide game play strategy that allows players to introduce viruses (represented by tokens) onto their opponents Object cards. You cant win unless you have 10 Object cards on your side with no virus tokens on them. Other Action cards shield your Objects from viruses (like Anti Virus), and help to clean virus tokens off your Object cards (Cleanup). There are Action cards that allow you to steal a card from another player (Piracy), remove anti-virus protection (AV Killer), or that pesky Virus Generator card (Scan), or search for a card in the discard pile (Backup). Some Action cards like Virus!, Recycle or Repair use a 6-sided die to determine how many virus tokens are placed or removed from your Object cards. This adds an aspect of chance to the game, and helps make every game you play different.

A more attainable goal of playing to just 6 virus-free objects is recommended by some players.

5498,Maltese,1977,6.5,3,0,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Card Game ,Hand ManagementSet Collection,"Maltese uses tiles in an original rummy-type game in which completing sets can enable players to force tiles out of their opponent's hands.

Tiles come in 5 colors, and each tile has an inset in any of those same 5 colors.  Half of the insets will match the tile's exterior, half won't.  So, for example, of the 16 green tiles, 8 have green insets, 2 have orange, 2 have white, 2 have read, and 2 have blue.

All players can see the external color of a tile, but only the owner sees its inset - and the inset color is what really counts.

Additionally, each player has a tile holder (shield) which holds the tiles in 5 rows.  When playing into this section of the shield, all the tiles in a row must be a single color (inset), and each row must be a different color.  So you'll have one row that is all-white, one that is all-red, etc, but you can choose which is which.  Furthermore, each row contains a different # of tiles, from 1-5.  The goal is to completely fill in this section of your shield: a total of 5 matched rows with a total of 15 tiles.

A typical turn involves choosing a tile randomly, placing it into your hand, and then moving one tile from your hand into the central, scoring, part of the shield.  There are two key moves that occur.  One is when you complete a row.  At this point, you announce ALL UNFINISHED ROWS OF THAT SAME INSET COLOR GO BACK TO THE ARMORY (Draw pile).  This is where both the varying # of tiles, and the limited information are crucial.  You could, for example, play a single green tile in your #1 row - and complete it.  If an opponent is working on a larger green row that is incomplete, he may have to discard as many as 4 green tiles.  You know that half of the green exterior tiles are green - so you only have limited information as to which of your opponents' rows might be green, or if they are even working on any green rows.

The second attack move occurs when you complete a row that is entirely matched (Insert color matches exterior color).  You can even do this by replacing unmatched tiles with matched tiles in rows you've already completed.  You then announce ALL FINISHED BUT UNMATCHED ROWS OF THAT SAME ROW NUMBER ARE BACK TO THE ARMORY.  In this case, if you complete a matched #3 row, all opponents who have completed unmatched #3 rows must toss all of these three tiles back into the draw pile.

Game ends when the first player completes all 5 rows with 5 different colors - matched or not.

5501,Death in the Dark,1998,5.57143,7,0,2,2,120,120,,Fantasy Fighting Miniatures ,Action Point Allowance SystemDice Rolling,"Published in 1998, and based off of The Universal Soldiers tabletop miniatures rules by Colin McClelland, Paul Sharpe  John Laing, this game is similar to Mordheim, in its fantasy skirmish theme.  The theme in this game, however, is that of rival mining companies fighting for success in the mines/dungeons/caverns surrounding the underground holdings of Arkonis.

The base game comes with two sides:  the Dwarven Prospectors vs. the Vanir (dark elves) and their terrible spider minions.

The game features upgrading units, hiring mercenaries, and buying weapons and equipment between scenarios.  The combat rules are more streamlined than that of Morheim, and the campaign game is more fleshed out.  You can buy add-ons to the home base of your mining company that can do numerous things for you.  Things that increase income, security, etc.

Many battles take place in the corridors of the mines, but the battle can be taken to a player's home base if needed.  As such, players map out their home bases as they purchase rooms (e.g. jails, vaults, storage, etc), fortifications (e.g. gates, walls, traps, etc), and other assorted upgrades on to them.

RAFM has released other races to play, including Orcs, Undead, and Reptiliads (lizard men) to name a few.  In addition, the game works very well with the line of dungeon scenery from Dwarven Forge.  The playing time noted above should be considered the time for one or two scenarios, including the in between campaign management.  But, like most games of this type, it can go on for as long as you like.

'Bailiwick is a fun easy to learn strategy game (only seven rules) of fast moves and quick-thinking, where players zigzag their tokens forward and backward around the rings, while racing to the center. The kaleidoscopic game board is a tricky maze where you must be on guard, because with the roll of the dice and the movement of a token, the whole can quickly shift!

The challenge of Bailiwick' is to wind your way through the four rings, moving your triangular tokens either forward (counter-clockwise) on the colored spaces, or backward (clockwise) on the white ones, and maneuvering them onto the steppingstones, to advance upward, as you try to be the first player to get all four tokens into your matching center bailiwick space.

This game shares some similarities with Pachisi and Aggravation.

The Pink Panther starts in the inner track and rolls two dice; the players start on the outer track and roll one die.  Note that the Pink Panther moves on each player's turn.  Whenever the Pink Panther lands on a Trapped? space, a die against die check is made, re-rolling ties; if red is higher than white, the Pink Panther escapes.  Otherwise the player gets a Pink Panther card.

The players can enter the inner track, triggering Trapped? checks as before.  The risk, however, is that by landing on an Escapes? space, the player may lose a Pink Panther card (this isn't as bad as it sounds, since the space gives a card as often as it takes one).  If both the Pink Panther and the player land on an Escapes?/Trapped? space simultaneously, this is considered an automatic Escape/Capture.

On an Escapes? space, if you have two or more Pink Panther cards, you may go for the Big Chance.  This is a die check as above, the stakes being all of your Pink Panther cards against instant victory.

Players collect cards from the deck and discards to form bands in one of the genres or crossover bands in the form of boy bands and girl groups.  Each group's value is based on the aggregate appeal of the invididual musicians, how novel they are and whether they employed singing and dancing instructors, not to mention the all-important stylist.

The boss demands that each producer's (player's) band be an improvement over his last one so it gets trickier and trickier.  This is made harder by the fact that a player may never keep more than six cards. Play over several hands to see who is the best producer of them all.

Premiered Essen 2002.

From the publisher's site:

Perform castings to choose among the (more or less) talented stone age musicians and form succesful bands with them. Maybe you succeed in becoming Producer of the Year. But to achieve that every new band has to surpass their predecessors... no easy task!

Bamboozle - The Hide and Seek game with McKeever and the Colonel as seen on NBC TV.

The game board is a symmetric 'battlefield', each side containing 6 huts connected by pathways. A Grey path separates the Red and Blue sides of the board.

Each player starts the game with eight pieces: two marked 1 (which move one space per turn), three marked 2 (which move two spaces) and three marked 3 (which move three spaces). These are also the victory point values of the pieces.

A screen is placed between the two sides and each player places their eight 'men' into one of the six huts (some huts may be left empty). Once all pieces are placed, the screen is removed and the game begins.

On his turn, a player may 'start' a piece (by moving it from a hut) or move an active piece the number of spaces equal to it's value. If a piece can reach an opponent by exact count, the opponent's piece is captured and removed from the game. If a piece reaches a hut, the opponent MUST start a piece from the hut on his next turn (if a piece is hidden there).

The game ends when one player moves 10 points worth of pieces across the Grey center path or, if both players have less than 10, all of his pieces (they highest total wins).

In each of the hideouts a scoring marker (a small cardboard gun inserted into a random scoring base which varies in points from 1,000 to 5,000 points) is placed face down so that none of the players know the values beforehand.

Each player (up to four) is given a set of 30 tiles on which is printed a 'chain' (or in game terms... a police cordon).  Tiles must be placed on the grid so that the 'chain' is continued.  Certain squares on the board provide an additional turn.

When the 'chain' forms a closed loop and encloses one or more 'mobster hideouts', the player who closed the loop takes the scoring markers for all of the hideouts inside the loop.  Placement within the loop is now forbidden and any tiles that exist within the loop are returned to their owner.

When all 24 hideouts have been surrounded, the player who encircled the last hideout gets 1,000 bonus points.  Players add up the values of all the mobsters that they captured and the one with the most points wins.

Each player also controls a rabbit which will try to eat the other players' vegetables and a hunter that tries to keep the rabbit away. In the game the pieces have moves similar to chess pieces. The horse moves like a knight (of course), the farmer like the king, the rabbit like a bishop and the hunter like a rook. Players receive 2 points for each vegetable grown and 1 point for each bucket of manure.

Components restrict the game to six, but any number can play.  Players keep going until a set time limit is reached (I suggest at least 2 hours) or when the there is only one player left in the game (if played without descendants).  If descendants are being used, the game is never ending and can go on indefinitely.

The highs and lows of society are portrayed by spaces on the board.  Businesses may be bought and sold, players may get a higher education, join a Co-op, become a thief, enter the military, etc.

An additional random element is in the form of 'Change' cards.  With the draw of a card you can become an alcoholic, get busted and sent to prison, become a parent of quintuplets, etc.  Because there are only 54 of these cards, they seem to come up again and again... expecially when six are playing.

Elections make the game the most fun.  During an election, players are encouraged to put issues to a vote... majority rules.  This allows aspects of the game rules to be changed or outright ingored!  Because of this, interesting things can happen, for example: elimination of taxes or a military coup d'etat.

Very luck driven, in that a roll of one die determines movement on the map and also altitude increments of 1,000 ft. Player choices amount to deciding what altitude to fly and which air field to visit next.

Random weather cards cause problems while flying over certain areas of the board or flying through certain altitudes. Fuel consumption is basically one unit every time the die is rolled, and running out of fuel can force a landing at an emergency air field or cause a pilot to bail out.

The game is interesting because of the scale plastic planes used as playing pieces (actual reproductions of the F-105) and in the cardboard 'control panels' which players use to keep track of altitude and fuel. The rules also include a two-page insert describing the world's most powerful one-man airplane in detail.

The game is both a game by itself or can be played as an expansion to Cry Havoc. As a stand-alone game it has 5 scenarios and 2 maps (a camp and a castle). There are rules that cover a range of siege warfare tactics such as siege weapons, fire, breaching walls and scaling ladders. It is well suited for play-by-email format and can be adapted for decent solitaire play as well.

The unit scale is one man to one counter. Each man (or woman! They are here too!) is generally represented by multiple counters or both sides of a single counter to portray healthy and wounded combatants as well as mounted and unmounted (including the horses) where applicable. Each counter has a nicely colored picture of each man with attack defense and movement values in addition to the name of the person depicted.

Integrates with:

A player spins for a question category and if the question is answered correctly, gains money, then advances towards the Gateway to the Bank.

Penalties are applied for answering a question wrong.  These range from losing money to moving backwards on the track. Play continues until all of the bonus coins are awarded.

The player with the most money wins.

An interesting note:  each question card contains two questions, one marked 'grown-up' and one marked 'youngster'.  These can be used to balance the game if younger players are involved or handicap players if the 'yougster' questions are considered too easy.

A nice trivia game, but limited to only 30 questions per category.  And because the game was produced in the 50s, the questions (which were current at the time) are dated.

5630,Eighth Air Force,1995,7.30284,264,2.1212,2,8,20,20,Wargames,Aviation / Flight Card Game Expansion for Base-game Wargame World War II ,Campaign / Battle Card Driven,"from GMT website:

Eighth Air Force is a fast-action card game that allows players to experience the tension and thrill of aerial combat over Europe during World War II. Eighth Air Force provides players with the major fighter and bomber aircraft flown by the German, British, Russian and United States air forces. You'll experience the dawn of the jet age with the introduction of the German Me-262; the pressure of leading British Lancaster heavy bomber formation at night; and the maximum effort needed to sustain the wings of the United States Eighth Air Force.

Included are six new Air Campaigns from the early U.S. Air Force Daylight Bombing missions of 1942 to the Royal Air Force Night Bombing missions of 1944. Also included are four famous air operations: the British Dam Busters Raid of 1943; the German 1942-43 Stalingrad Airlift; the Eighth Air Force Schweinfurt Raids of 1943; and Operation Blue Monday, the destruction of the V-1 and V-2 rocket launch sites.

Note: To play Eighth Air Force, you need a copy of Rise of the Luftwaffe, Volume One in the Down in Flames Series.


BGG description:

Eighth Air Force extends Rise of the Luftwaffe to the second half of World War II: 1942-1945.  It adds jets, altitude, heavy cannon and bombers.  The rule book is designed to supersede Rise of the Luftwaffe's, with the additions peculiar to Eighth Air Force discreetly marked in the margins.

Of the remaining Down in Flames series, Zero! was published in 2001 and covers the Pacific theatre of the first half of WW2.  Corsairs and Hellcats is the 4th game in the series (Pacific theatre, 1942-1945). Flying Circus (WW1) has been mentioned as a similar game set during WWI, but it is not listed on the GMT Games LLC website.

The object of the game is simple... get your selected 'secret' number to your opponent's first row.

Pieces may move, on a clear path, as many spaces that are open or make single or multiple 'jump' moves (similar to Chinese Checkers) or combine a move by sliding and then making a jump.

Players alternate moving pieces with the only restriction being that they can't move a piece that was just moved by their opponent... moving your opponent's colour is allowed.

If your secret number is moved to your opponent's first row, you win (whether you made the move or not).

Players roll a die and move around the board looking for clues.  Clue cards each contain two clues that might be important to the case in hand.  Each clue is assigned a point value from 1 to 3, and when a player collects three of the four clues listed on his case card, adds the numbers together to get a value for his 'suspect' (which range from 3 to 9).

Players may steal, trade or get new clue cards by questioning witnesses and cross referencing a die roll on the 'Question Witness Chart'.

Because the numbers assigned to the clues could be the same, more than one player may be after the same suspect.

The first person to deliver a suspect (with a number that matches the total of three of his clues) to the courthouse wins.

NOTE: This game is a re-formatting of Transogram's The Game of Dragnet.

Players may stop at any time, call Chicken!,  and collect money equal to the space where their token lies; otherwise, they spin the chicken again to try and collect a higher reward.  If a token moves past the end of a track, it collects nothing.

After six different tracks are played, the player with the highest total is the winner.

Players then vote on the outcome... majority rules.  Each player who did NOT vote with the majority MUST then try to sway the popular voters to change their vote... each minority voter gets one minute to do this.  The majority voters then cast their ballots again.

Once the second vote is complete, the minority still has an option to challenge, whether they convinced anyone to change their vote or not.  If a quote is challenged incorrectly, the challenger loses two points while everyone else gains one.  If a quote is unchallenged, the majority voters gain one point each.

Each player picks three tiles and a player is chosen to start the game.  Play is simple, place a tile to the table on either side of an already placed tile.  Once a row of 11 tiles is formed, a new row must be started.  The player then draws to refill his hand to three.

Whenever three or more spots of a colour exist, a player scores one point for each spot, diagonal lines count double.   A player who plays a 'triple' automatically gains at least three points.

When all pieces are placed on the board, players take turns moving one piece each to one adjacent space. A space is considered adjacent if it could be considered part of the same pie.

Special consideration must also be given to the edge of the board where there are circles that simulate a red piece, while blank edges simulate a white piece.

They really love shouting about anything. And they really love shouting about very very important things. They just love telling each other about how hungry they are feeling, or how stupid, tough or naughty they are. And sooner or later, being Gobbos, they start arguing. BUT Gobbos had better watch out for Trolls! They can shout even louder than Gobbos. Trolls are much, much more hungry, tough, stupid and naughty than any green Gobbo. Players take cards and compare one of four statements with each other. The player with the best card wins the round and takes the trick.

Winner is the person with the most cards at the end of the round.

5696,Crisis,1975,6.375,4,2,3,4,45,45,,Bluffing Card Game Humor ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"Each player is given a set of 12 weapon card.  Card list a weapon and a number of points for that weapon. e.g.- '1000 Screaming Peasants Waving Pitchforks' is worth 1 point, '30 Germ Warfare Bombs' is worth 25 points, '5 Nuclear missile Submarines' is worth 100 points.

A game consists of a number of rounds until only one player remains.  Each player gets one turn during each round.  On a turn each player declares: I propose we disarm... (a weapon) worth... (x points) and places one card face down on the table.  Each other player does the same.  The smallest card a player may declare must be worth 25 points, so getting rid of those 1 point Ceremonial sabers can be tricky.

A turn of 'Weapons Inspections' follows.  Each player may then call for an inspection of another players card.  First, he shows that he had disarmed the proper number of points, then turns over the card of one other player.  If it is the proper card, he gets to return it to his hand.  If it isn't the proper card, one card at random is drawn and placed face down with the first.

If no one calls for a weapons inspection, a die is rolled for a random 'spot-check'.

All cards played in a turn are discarded.

At the end of a round (once each player has had a turn disarming weapons), a 'Crisis' card is flipped.  The card can be NO CRISIS or can list the names of two of the players who must then resolve a 'crisis' between each other.  Players resolve a crisis but tallying the number of points in their hands and, depending on the difference in points, resolve the conflict.  A player is out of the game if he is beaten by more than 150 points.

At the end of the round, the discard pile is shuffled and each player gains two cards.

Play continues until only one player is left.

Players roll a die to move around the board, collecting money from artifacts purchased and from answering riddles.  Some of the riddles can be answered through logic:
  Q.  How do you stop a kid from crying in the back seat?
  A.  Make him move up front.

  Q.  Why did the grizzly buy a pair of shoes?
  A.  Because he had bear feet.

5713,Game of Politics,1935,5.35625,16,0,2,6,60,60,,Political ,Dice Rolling,"Politics simulates a simplified version of the presidential election in the United States of America (electoral votes based on the 1930 or 1950 census, depending upon the edition of the game).

The playing board represents a map of the United States showing each state and its capital.  The goal in both editions is to win the vote, which occurs when all the states have at least one candidate in it and someone rolls doubles. The player who has the most counties in any given state wins all the electoral votes from that state; in case of a tie, the player who reached the total first wins the state. If one player does not have a majority of electoral votes (269), only the two players with the highest votes continue - the rest are eliminated. It continues until another official vote is taken and a winner is determined.

In the 1935 edition, campaigning is conducted via a mix of dice rolls and speech cards.  Players are given money and three speech cards at the beginning of the game, and whenever 7 or 11 is rolled an additional speech card is auctioned.  Speech cards give players a small number of counties in specific states, allowing players to more effectively focus their campaigning and make comebacks.  On a turn, players roll three dice.  The dice (all the same color) are summed, and the total can be used to campaign in each of the 48 states.  Small states - those with 3 to 5 electoral votes - take only 1 point to win a county, while larger states require as many as nine points to win a county.

The 1952 edition is significantly simplified.  On a player's turn, the player rolls 3 dice (1 colored, 2 white) - the colored dice tells the player which states to be worked in this turn and the white dice tells the player how many counties (4-7 in each state) they win.

Simultaneously, the defensive player chooses one die from a set of four that represent defensive strategies (Overpower, Induce Grounder, Induce Fly, Pitch Around) and adds it to the cup.

Players move around the board, buy/sell stocks and bond and check rising and falling prices of stocks held.

Originally self-published in 1962, Parker Brothers bought the rights and republished it in 1966.  Later self-published again as Arbitrage.

A description of Arbitrage:

Arbitrage (HC Jacoby Inc) Is a stock market and corporate manipulation board game. The board is a Monopoly type with the movement track that goes around the edge and with the middle taken up mostly with price tracks for the 6 corporations in the game. Each corporation has 3 spaces in a row on the outside track that counts as it's home. Then there are a few other spaces that give allow either specific actions like buying/selling mutual funds, or make you draw a random event or a stock manipulation card. Stocks are bought buy mainly landing on one of the 3 spaces of a corporation's home, or buy landing on a mutual fund space. If you own 3 stoacks of a corporation you become its president and can pay out dividends to stockholders, or can merge corporations thus increasing stock prices. Other things that can happen are takeovers - forcing a resident to sell you his shares, options - a chance to buy shares from the bank or another player for 1/2 price. Trading of shares between players at any time is also encouraged. The game ends either after a set ammount of time, or when a player goes bankrupt.

Movement around the board is accomplished with 3 dice ( regular D6, and 1 special die which has symbols on it to move stock prices either up or down. A player's turn consists of rolling the three dice, moving his marker to the new space, manipulating a stock price up or down by the die roll, then performing the action on the space where you landed (if any).

Players take turns to roll a die to move their planes on the board.  The planes must first enter the Holding Pattern, then the Landing Pattern before they can land on the airstrip; players slide down the planes on their stands as they do so.

Each space on the board contains instructions that must be followed.  Emergency and Special Clearance cards are drawn when planes land on their space, and their effects (beneficial and detrimental) must be executed.  Planes can only enter the Landing Pattern through the effects of certain Special Clearance cards.  To land on the airstrip, planes must land exactly on the Final Approach spaces on the Landing Pattern.  Players then need to roll on their next turn to determine if their planes can taxi to and park at their designated gates.

The first player to park all his or her planes is the winner.  The game ends when the third player has parked his or her planes, effectively establishing the rest of the positions.

There are 9 pictures on each card and the player must answer two questions about one of the individuals pictured. Two correct answers give control of the card to the player. One correct answer gives control of the card to the player, but it can be stolen by another player who answers both questions on that player's card and identifies the photo. Once the deck is exhausted scoring is done by giving two points for each two-answered question card controlled by a player and one point for each one-answered question card.

The player with the most points wins.

However, the creators have added some extra elements by splitting the questions into categories, rating the difficulty of the questions and tracking game progress using Bingo cards (they are referred to as such).

When a player rolls the game die, the result corresponds to a number on his/her Bingo Card. The numbers are shown multiple times on the cards in different colours.  These colours correspond to a specific category of questions including Famous Martyrs, Saints and Sinners and  History - Pre Vatican II. The number also corresponds to the level of difficulty of the question, that range from Easy to Extremely Difficult. If a player correctly answers the question, he/she places a token on the number and colour that was answered. If not, play passes to the next person. A roll of a 6 is a free will where a player may select whichever space wanted.

The player wins with 5 tokens in a row, vertically or horizontally.

Players each have 10 pieces (numbered 1-10), and are trying to capture 5 consecutively numbered pieces (from any number of players).  A piece can move as many spaces as the number of other pieces adjacent to it.  That's most of the rules right there - like Sid Sackson's other abstracts, it's fairly simple (to understand, not necessarily to play well).

This is similar to Fields of Action, the rules to which were published in R. Wayne Schmittberger's New Rules for Classic Games (although originally considered for inclusion in Sid Sackson's own A Gamut of Games). However, that game is only for 2 players and has a few other differences.

There are also Production  Publicity cards much like chance and community chest in Monopoly. Bankruptcies occur if you have to pay more than you have.

Players design games (by placing a 'game' card on their production track), find distributors, place games in the market, make deals, and attend Conventions.

Depending on the quality (High, Average, or Cheesy) of the game and when it hits the market, money is earned... minus any distribution fees, of course. Getting to a Convention (between the Summer and Fall turns) requires a vote... the player with the most money gets two votes, the player with the least money gets no votes at all.  A player may only ever bring three games to a single Con. Players start out with anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 depending on whether they are doing this part-time or not.

The first player to reach $100,000 wins.  The game may also end after the 20th turn, in which case the player with the greatest net worth is the winner.

The board is broken down into different modes of transportation: car, train, and plane.  Each player roll dice and moves to a city that matches one of his News cards to score the news story and gain points... each story is worth from 10 to 25 points.

Whenever double six is rolled on the dice, a Headline card (50 points) is drawn, which goes to the player who gets to the city first.  Once four Headline cards have been 'captured', the next card flipped is a Scoop (100 points).  When the Scoop is delivered, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.

By stirring the cauldron with the bone, the mysterious moving Mystic Skull will magically stop at the various voodoo segments around the board, directing you to place pins in your opponent's voodoo doll or to exchange one of your tokens in order to remove pins from your own doll.

Players should use their tokens wisely and to their best advantage--they may help a player eliminate an opponent or save himself, but when a player uses his tokens up, he is at the mercy of the other players.

Each turn, players may trade, pay their salary, play up to two cards, pay old and new workers, and re-draw up to four cards.  Then the Economic Index is adjusted, and all companies are payed based upon the overall state of the economy and the ability to control monopolies.  Cards include a variety of companies, boom and bust, changes in the labor pool, accounting scams, anti-trust and stocks.

Because it is possible for all players to lose, some cooperation is necessary within an overall competitive framework.  Although the Economic Index may seem at first to dispense its rewards and penalties equally, clever players will soon find that they can manipulate it to their advantage.  Similarly, while supply and demand regulates the availability of labor, there is room for maneuvering as players strive to pay workers as little as possible while avoiding having the workers stolen away by higher-paying rivals.  As Chief Executive Officers players can name their own salary, but if they raise it too far too fast they will soon find their company in economic trouble.

Game play basically falls into two parts; early, the players control small startup companies and maneuver to build them into large corporate entities.  In the game's late stages, great manipulation is possible, and excellent timing necessary, as each player struggles to amass the greatest personal fortune possible without going to jail, and to end the game at the perfect moment.

The game takes 2-5 players and usually lasts from one to two hours.

The object of the game is to be the player with the least amount of radiation (identified in millirems or Mr) when the nuclear reactor is brought to a cold shutdown.

The players, in some ways, represent water being cycled through the cooling loops of the nuclear power plant in an effort to reduce their radioactivity.

Each player starts out with 180 Mr of radiation identified by Mr cards in 10, 20, 50 and 100 Mr values. Card hands are kept secret - an important feature of the game. Radiation is reduced by 100 Mr with each completed circuit of the Cooling Tower loop, the longest of the three loops. While traveling through the loops, the player lands on Operation spaces and Mr spaces. The Operational spaces allow players to draw operation cards which might help to reduce their millirems, cause them to lose a turn, or increase/decrease the temp in the reactor core. Mr spaces add radiation to the player's hand.

Player's may also draw operation valve cards or other cards that might help them to effect a cold shutdown on the reactor. Valve cards prevent other players from moving around the loop. The challenge is in knowing when to shut down the reactor based on what you know about the other players' hands. Of course, the possibility also exists that the core temperature will rise to a meltdown point, which will also end the game.

The Cards also feature information about the Cruise Experience - shipboard activities, shoreside excursions and the wonder of awaking to a new destination aboard your floating luxury hotel with it's multi-national staff and crew.

Designer Notes

In designing this game, I have gone against the grain in accepted board game strategies where the norm is to win at any cost; destroying, trivializing or bankrupting other players along the way to a so called victory. The main theme of this game is of the Journey ~ not the finish, and it is hoped that in playing this game people will be encouraged to take a real journey, maybe to the beautiful islands and waters of the Caribbean or maybe further afield where they can interact with others, break down barriers and fears, find new life-paths and celebrate the world in a more spititual and humanitarian light.

The Game is packaged in a clear polycarbonate Captain's Chart Tube ( a virtually unbreakable and watertight container, adding to the nautical theme ). To repackage Game ~  roll up all game contents in the laminated gameboard and slide game back into chart tube. Gameboard may also be left out of tube and bluetacked to wall as a poster between uses.

The game has a small (17x16) map and 72 unit counters representing armor, infantry, mech, parachute, glider and ranger/commando units, varying in size from battalion to brigade. Airpower and naval gunfire are handled abstractly.

There are three scenarios: historical, free setup using historical units, and variable historical occurrences. Short rules and a low unit count make the game move quickly, but it can last up to 25 turns.  The rules include optional rules and several scenarios (including a couple of What Ifs), and an historical commentary.

The Allies have more units and the ability to make sea invasions, but they also have the burden of attack. The Axis need to make wise use of the difficult terrain to delay the Allied advance.  Points are awarded to players based on objectives either captured or held... the player amassing the highest number of points wins the game.

The (rather plain) map shows a number of danger areas (spider webs and the like, although they are all abstracted) and ant trails, with the nests around the edges. Players move worker and soldier ants out of their nests and around the board trying to collect food and avoid the danger areas and the praying mantises, which move randomly across the map eating ants. Soldier ants may attack ants from other colonies.

Players move around a not-entirely-linear board buying orbital stations and the like and charging rent (sorry, docking fees).  There are some additional ways to make money such as mines and special side tracks on the board.  Additional mechanics are mostly combat-related - players start with fighters and may buy frigates and battlecruisers.  Players may fight each other or the fleets of the Empire, which is a neutral party that moves around the board taxing players (although players may take their fleets over sometimes, apparently - the rules are very hard to follow).

The box says it can be played by up to 12 people, but only 4 pawns are provided (and fighters come in just 3 colors - but organization does not seem to be the publisher's strong point).  The components could fairly be described as primitive, except for the board, which is a bit garish but serviceable.

A card is revealed from a deck. A die is rolled and results in WORD or COLOR. The goal of the game is to be the first person to put down a correct card, where correct is:

WORD: a card the color of the word of the revealed card. 
COLOR: a card with the word that is the color of the revealed card.

For example, if the card is a blue card with the word red and WORD is rolled, then you must play a red card from hand (not one that says red). If COLOR is rolled you must play a card with the word blue.

Clear? Well, I suppose it isn't supposed to be.

Things are spiced up by not being allowed to play if a card which describes itself is revealed (a red card saying red for example), and by having a special contra call when you play the reverse card of the one shown (red card saying blue is contra blue card saying red.)

The principle component to the game are 48 cards with two strategies, A and B, cross referenced with the roll of a pair of dice, and a payoff. For example:

STRATEGY A: 2-7: -10$, 8-10: +100$, 11-12: +1250$
STRATEGY B: +300$, -100$, -120$

In the basic game players take turns revealing the cards, choosing a strategy, and rolling to see the gain or loss. In the slightly more advanced game each player is allowed to buy partial information on a card, by rolling a single die before committing to a strategy. In the example above partial information costs 90$, and if you bought it then rolled a 6 you would be more inclined to choose strategy A.

In the advanced game players take turns revealing cards, and auctioning them off to the other players who then play them against the auctioning player, rather than a bank. Additionally each card has a set indicator, and when you collect six cards in a set you can turn them in for 500$ from each player.

To move the pieces, players roll the coloured dice and heed the following rules: different colours - move those two elephants, same colours - move the elephant back one square. The next player has the choice to keep one of the dice or re-roll both.

Elephants work their way to the end of the board until one reaches the turn square. When this happens, all elephants turn around to race back to the start.

The game ends when there is only one elephant left on the track. If that elephant belongs to a player, he/she is the winner. If it is the maharaja's, the first player who made it back to the start is the winner.

Built on simplicity of game piece movement, TRIAD plays rapidly, but, to win, requires an uncommon accomplishment. You must achieve three unique outcomes: a Trap, a Capture and a Score.

The game is played on a board crisscrossed by lines in three directions.  Tiles are played on the intersections and remain where they are played unless captured.  Pawns are played inside the triangles and move from space to space.  The object of the game is to complete scores, traps and captures; once one of those is accomplished, a new round is played.  The first person to accomplish one of each is the winner; once you've accomplished one, you are not allowed to repeat that.

A score is accomplished by moving a pawn from your goal to the opponent's goal.  A trap is accomplished by trapping an opponent's pawn so that it cannot move.  A capture is accomplished by capturing ten of your opponent's tiles.

Each card allows you to move to a particular postion relative to where you currenty are (for example, a chocie of straight up two squares or up two squares and left or right one). However, there must be an open window that is not occupied by another player for it to be a legal move. Whenever a player passes certain checkpoints, the spinner is spun to see if anything falls from the windows. If you're hit on the head, you drop down to the next open window. There is also a gorilla that knocks you all the way down if you're unfortunate enough to be hit by him.

First one to get to the top of the building and escape on the helicopter wins.

The game board is a plastic sphere with Velcro squares attached to it, and the pieces are also Velcro, so they stick to the squares and each other.

The game was apparently at times known as Obol, The Game of O, or O*, and was manufactured as early as 1988 though the last version was made in 1991. The standard game is on a 24-square sphere.  A 12-square sphere was also available, the rulebook advertises a 30-square sphere, and there are indications that at one point they had a 36-square sphere, though there is no confirmation any of the larger sizes were ever available for sale.  Also, a sphere with many more squares (120?) exists only in prototype form.

The rulebook includes rules for other games, including a checkers variant and a (credited) version of Sid Sackson's Focus for the spherical board.


        I can confirm that at least 5 copies of a 30-ball were sold at one game convention in Los Angeles (I got one of them). I can also confirm seeing a much, MUCH larger ball -- several feet in diameter -- with lots of spaces and a 4 (5?) person game in progress (same convention). ~~~~

This goal is achieved by gathering magical items that are most compatible with their character.

At the start, each player is given a secret Wizard card (each with its SpellName and element type) and a hand of cards.  A Magic Item card is then revealed, starting off a round of fighting for it.  Taking turns, the players draw a card from the common deck and play, keep or discard it.  Through these cards, the players deploy heroes and monsters to fight, boost them up with equipment and spells, and kill off certain types of units.  The player with the highest value from his cards wins the Magic Item.  Played cards are discarded, and the next round begins by revealing another Magic Item.

The game ends when all cards in the deck have been drawn.  The players reveal their wizards and tally the points for their artifacts' affinity with their wizard's element type.  The player with the highest score is the winner.  During the game, each player has one chance to guess another player's element type.  If the guess is correct, the target cannot win the game at the end even if he or she has the most points.

Choose safer waters or attempt to navigate shorter but riskier waters, grown the size of your Humpback family, and play Bonus cards at the right time to ensure your survival or save them to earn additional points at game end.

But this game is more than about winning where you also learn about these majestic creatures. All Hazard and Bonus cards have carefully researched 'Whale Facts' that help you learn about other life forms and be sensitive to environments beyond what you readily know. There are also opportunities to help other players' whales, such as those that have been beached, which give you additional bonus cards and further the survival of the species as a whole. Whales further ahead in the game can choose to 'wait' and encourage the survival of more whales before returning to their home waters (which immediately ends the game)

The environmental group Green Peace has promoted this game and part of the profits go to helping save whales.

GAMEPLAY
The main objective is Whale Survival through the accumulation of points. You roll the die then navigate your whale pod (family) along the paths starting at the Home Waters heading south to warmer waters for the winter, into family waters to find a mate and give birth to young, then head back north again to the Home Waters attempting to end on the same specific location you started from.

Along the way you encounter Hazards (cards you draw) which hinder your progress and also obtain 'Bonus' cards which may help you move along faster or avoid Hazards later in the game.

The larger your family (up to 4 members) plus bonuses from unused cards and finishing first help determine the winner.

6136,Cloister Games,1992,4.63636,11,1,2,2,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area EnclosureArea MovementPoint to Point Movement,"Cloister Games is a nicely presented compilation of four medieval games, typical of those found etched onto monastery floors.  Fox and Geese is played on a board instantly recognizable to us as solitaire. The single Fox wins by jumping over the geese, landing on an empty point and thereby diminishing the flock until it is no longer viable. The geese win by hemming in the fox  so he cannot move. It's not easy to win as the geese. The fascinating game of Merels is better known as Nine Mans Morris and has an entry to itself elsewhere in this database. Albuquerque is perhaps the pick of the bunch, with a strategy resembling a cross between draughts and Merels and its influence is clearly to be seen in modern derivatives such as Kensington. Finally, Fierges is identical to draughts but without the compulsion (huffing) rule.  Each  game is eminently playable in its own right and, together, provide a fascinating insight into the development of modern draughts (checkers). The four boards are beautifully illuminated in medieval style and accompanied by wooden pieces.

The storm which is World War IV engulfs the continent of Australia. War sparks ingenuity. Ingenuity birth technology. Technology is escalation. The puppet regime which is called Shuttoral World Government is the enemy. The Australian-led resistance grows in strength with the advent of the HAFS Jerry, a tow-legged tank with a ground speed of 54 km/hr. War continues

January 11, 2885: New Canberra City falls to Australian forces. The Germans retreat south skirting the desert.
February 3, 2885: Shuttoral forces, isolated, make an abortive drive on the township of Gibson. A beachhead rescue saves most ot the force.
April 25, 2885: Shuttoral scientists make a secret presentation to Command of the prototype Krachen vogel, armed drone recon. This weapon will be particularly nasty to the Allies because of its similarity to the un-armed Neuspotter.
April 26, 2885: Plans begin for a new Shuttoral offensive towards New Canberra City. The directive is Take, or destroy.

(BGG description:)

With all of the science fiction wargames that were published in Japan, almost all were based off anime shows, and none used original designs (even the US Battletech just used robots from JPN anime shows without permission to begin). This one does use its own story and designs.

The game includes 4 mounted maps, and many scenarios that are each given their own scenario cards (ala the US Squad Leader wargame). Includes slightly larger counters than are usually used in Japanese wargames.

There was an expansion/sequel to this produced.

Spider-Man attempts to capture the enemies in rope or his web, and the bad guys try to enter a building with a armored car, break into it, and escape from Manhattan Island (or, if they prefer, to defeat Spider-Man).

Overall style is a hex-and-counter boardgame, with event cards and action cards to create variety from game to game. More light-hearted than most of Tsukuda's fare, this is part of their 'fun series' (as opposed to their 'not-any-fun series?). However, it is not overly simplistic, as the box does recommend Ages 12 and up

The rulebook is in Japanese, but the action and event cards are printed in both Japanese and English (on the same card, not two different sets). The map is in English (which, by the way, is 4 fold-out map sections that are combined to make one large map).

The deck is made up of 135 cards in 7 different colored suits. Each suit is made up of 17 color cards and 2 colored Stop cards. The remaining 2 cards are Superstop cards.

The basic flow of the game is that everyone grabs cards with one hand and puts it into their other hand until a stop card surfaces and someone yells Stop color for the color of the stop card. Any players in the process of picking up a card can add this card to their pile. Then, each player counts the number of cards of that color and the player with the fewest (or tied for the fewest) cards in that color receives a -1 card from the initial stock of 15 -1 cards. Additionally, if any player has cards out of order in their hand (not grouped by color), they receive an additional -1. The player who called the Stop then calls Go and the mayhem continues. Superstops cause the play to be stopped and the total number of cards to be compared, with the person with the fewest cards receiving a -1. The game ends immediately when the last -1 card is given out, and the winner is the player with the fewest -1 cards.

There are 3 principles:

    The first player who reaches 7 points or more wins the game
    The points are easy to take by launching one of your Centaur pawns bumping into opposite pawns showing some points (one or two).
    There is no board, and at extreme limits... there are no rules either, the players have to define what is correct or not to block the enemy fire !




It seems to be a dexterity game like Carom's or Pool, but it can be played in 5 minutes and everywhere if there is a table or some kind of surface. In fact, it's a true politically incorrect game, that can be played according to its rules or... not ! The rules are a bit complex and explain the multiple combination between counters and action pawns, but this complexity is more valuable for the trickiness !!!

The game is short enough so that it can be re-played thus avoiding silly quarrels, so let's play !

6159,Dragon Quest Dungeon,1990,7.21429,7,2,2,2,60,60,,Deduction Fantasy Video Game Theme ,Secret Unit Deployment,"This game is a fantasy based game with strong gameplay ties to Battleship.

Each player secretly sets up his own dungeon; there's a stand-up cut-out castle to use as a shield between the players. You place the square-shaped walls all over the place in your dungeon, along with stairwells to the smaller 2nd level of the dungeon. You also place your monsters and various treasures for the other player to discover, fake treasures (mimics) and your boss monster. You cannot place the weapons in such a way that they're impossible to get to (either cut off by walls or the boss monster). Your then tell the other player which space the entrance to the dungeon is.

Each player in turn calls out the space he wishes to move to. You must call out each space one at a time. If there is a wall there, the player's turn ends. If the space is clear, they may continue on. If there is a monster, it must be fought. If the player is victorious, he gains a reward card for defeating it and may continue on; otherwise his turn ends. If there is a treasure chest, the player may examine it. If it's a treasure, he may keep it and move on. If its a mimic (a monster that looks like a treasure chest), then he must fight it as if it was a monster.

Play alternates between players until one player gets all 3 necessary treasures and then fights and kills the boss monster; that player is the winner.

There is minimal text on the components; as long as one player knows the rules and what the cards do, it is easy to show the other player (the cards with JPN text on them have distinctive pictures to make it easy to remember once told what it does)..

6172,Monster Maker: Dragon Attack!,1990,0,0,0,2,2,45,45,,Exploration Fantasy ,Hex-and-CounterRoll / Spin and Move,"Come to think of it, the Dragon may be the one who was attacked. The humans showed off their own power stealing the Dragon's treasure, and taking it as their own. Finally the Dragon let out its anger, and began its revenge on the human kingdom of Silverado. The nearby villages burned from its breath, and every temple was destroyed. The Dragon proceeded towards the Royal Palace. Is there anyone who can stop the Dragon?

Dragon Attack is a simple fantasy boardgame. The player becomes an adventurer, and traverses Silverado, forming a party to stand against the Dragon. However, killing the Dragon is not the only objective. To revive the ruined Silverado will require a vast amount of money. In the end, when the Dragon is slain, the player with the most treasures becomes the true victor, and achieves glory for a long time.

(The above is my translation of the introduction to the game)

The game is a hex-and-counter style of game, where you move around the map, and turning over hidden counters to find enemies, allies, and treasure. However, anytime you roll a '1', the Dragon moves along a pre-determined path and destorys a village/temple. If noone can defeat the Dragon before it destroys the Royal Palace, everyone loses, making it a game where the players both compete against each other for treasure and against the game itself because of the Dragon-imposed time limit.

It looks as if the game was intended as a solitaire game, as the multiplayer game is more of a dungeon maze race, without all the combat, traps, or such.

On the island are five magic towers that have drawn the interest of the most powerful Master Summoners in the world.  They each want to fight for control of the towers and the power they contain. The object of the game is to move your armies in and seize control of a majority of the towers on the island.  Each player takes on the role of one of the five Master Summoners, who each have their own strengths and weaknesses and can summon different combat units to the island.  They do this by managing four magical resources that they have available to them.  As units are summoned onto the island, they are moved about where they have a number of options available to them:  visiting temples where they can be blessed, traveling through four different domains, attacking other players' units, and occupying the different towers to attempt to maintain control over them.

The first player to garrison a unit in the correct number of towers and hold them for a turn against his sieging enemies wins!

Summonaria has been re-released with a new fully illustrated battle board and variant rules to further customize gameplay and this new version is available now.

6182,Havic: The Bothering,1998,3.0625,16,0,2,12,45,45,Customizable,Card Game Collectible Components ,Hand Management,"A direct parody/rip-off of Magic: The Gathering. Fairly rare to find a package that isn't opened.

From the Rules Card:

Welcome to Havic! You are a student battling others in a strange, mysterious world. You and your opponent each have 21 points of sanity. Once a player's sanity has been reduced to zero, he loses.

To reduce your opponent's sanity, you will need to recruit peons, create effects, and use articles in any way possible to destroy your opponent before he destroys you. Your deck is your weapon against your worthy foe. It must contain exactly sixty cards.

After thoroughly shuffling your deck, each player draws eight cards from the top of the deck. A die is rolled. The player who rolls the highest number goes first.

When it is your turn, a player first drops a property card. When whacked, or turned sideways, this card, if this card is a brewery yields one unit of alcohol: a convenience store yields one unit of cigarettes. You can now use this unit to recruit peons, create effects, and articles as you see fit.

Each Peon, article, and effect has a creation cost. It is denoted on the top right hand corner of the card. For each beer bottle, or cigarette shown on a card, one and of the same type must be whacked.

In the case of peons, the first number in the bottom right hand corner denotes the amount of damage this peon can do to your opponent, or other peons. The second number denotes the amount of damage that it will take to send this peon to the hospital.

When a peon first comes into play, he is hung over and can't attack, but he can block if he is not whacked. Your peons can attack only on your turn, and only if it is not hung over or whacked. To attack, you must first announce the attack phase, and then whack the peons that are attacking. The opponent then decides which of your peons his peons will block, or he can opt to take the damage himself, reducing his sanity (though only a peon with stealth can block another peon with stealth).

Unlike a peon, once an effect is cast, it goes directly to the hospital. An article also does not work during the turn it comes into play. and like a peon, it must be whacked to have it's effect. Once you are done attacking, it is your opponent's turn. At the beginning of your next turn, all whacked cards, unless otherwise specified, become unwhacked. Good luck!

Each player (or duo) has a set of four heroes - king, princess, wizard and warrior. Each hero can retrieve gold and one type of treasure: works of art, jewels, magic potions and weapons, respectively. Treasure is kept in rooms, which the player places on his/her own track. Dragons appear in corridors, which are placed on an opponent's track, and must be fought with an attack card and the roll of a die.

Points are granted for retrieving treasures, killing dragons, capturing the Lord of Darkness and exiting the castle. The game ends when a player places an exit tile or when the deck of cards/tiles is finished.

P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos (it took me quite a while to find out that SPONGE stands for Stopping Powerful Organisms from N Gulfing Everything).  It is nominally a two-player game but can handle more players quite readily.

In the game, each player is a SPONGE Historian, helping out on an investigation.  The Historian position at SPONGE is often a short-lived one, and the Inactive Files are full of past Historians that didnt make it.  The object of the game is to last longer than any of your fellow Historians.

Each player also represents the forces of Evil that threaten to thwart SPONGE at every turn.  This means that you will be playing cards on your opponents as often as you play them on yourself.

Every Historian has his or her own deck of cards, comprised of seven categories: Locations (where your investigation takes you), Characters (people you encounter), Items (stuff you find), Weapons (stuff you find that will kill Beasts), Beasts (an assortment of creatures bent on killing you), Tomes (knowledge man was not meant to know) and Events (things that just happen to happen).

Each turn you normally get two Action Points.  It costs an Action Point to draw a card, play a card or perform certain Special Abilities --discarding is free, however.  Some card abilities cost more than one Action Point (some cost more than two!).  Unused Action Points are passed on to the next player.

Icons appear on the cards and act to guide play --each card brings icons in play, and each card requires certain icons to be in play before it can be played.

There are numerous ways to lose the game.  Basically, any action that would put you into one of the Inactive Files (Known Dead, Presumed Dead, Asylum, Missing, Resigned, Inaccessible or Other) also puts you out of the game.  The only exception is the Reanimated file.  If you die and get reanimated, you can keep playing the game, but you will suffer certain restrictions, making winning more difficult.

6239,Murder Mystery Party: Revenge of Konan Castle,1986,5.8,5,1,8,8,180,180,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Party Game ,Role Playing,"The Murder Mystery Party line of murder party games is the most extensive. They were originally published by University Games in California, but are now produced in England, though they still carry a note that the rights belong to University Games (who, when you call them, have no knowledge of the recent episodes).

These games play just like other main-stream murder party games like How to Host a Murder, Evening of Murder, Mysteries by Vincent, or Milton Bradley's Life of the Party. This episode:

Konan Castle was owned for centuries by the McDonald clan.  When the McDonalds killed two Campbells, a feud ensued and eventually the Campbells took the castle in the late 19th century.  The remaining McDonalds fled to the US and the castle went into disrepair.  For two generations (the year is 1955), the McDonalds waited to return to retreive their treasure (hidden within the castle).  So, a party of eight went to Scotland to search.  But the castle owner (Ian Campbell) was murdered.  Whodunnit?

The goals are to get three balls a) vertically on any one of the pegs b) horizontally on any level in any one row c) diagonally within any one row d) at the corners. It's not as confusing as it sounds once you read the instructions printed on the back of the box. Neat game. Probably didn't sell well. Ahead of its time I presume.

The fourth Bohnanza expansion from Lookout Games (in a limited sales edition of 2500 pieces) puts you in the Bohnreich!  Plantations, villages, cities, fortresses -- and 3 to 5 generals, who want to bring these under their control.

The Bohnanza base game is needed. Using new cards in Bohnaparte, the Bohnreich is laid out; each player receives counters of his own color; and play then loosely follows that of normal Bohnanza, with a small difference: earned bean coins are not saved but are used to finance your conquests throughout the Bohnreich. At the end it matters only who has the largest part of the Bohnreich under control. Battling is accomplished using the numbers on the bean cards, which gives new significance to the formerly weaker bean types. Designer Hanno Girke describes the expansion set as Bohnanza meets Risk.

Includes 33 cards, 60 game markers, and rules. Graphics by Marcel-Andre Casasola Merkle.

The AMIGO-Edition of Bohnaparte includes 50 Cards, 72 game markers and rules.

Each player is given a hand of 7 cards at the start, while all the other cards are mixed into a common deck.  One player starts the game by drawing a card from the deck and playing it.  Character cards (those with an icon) are placed face down, while other cards are played face up.  Going clockwise, the next player plays a card of higher value from his or her hand or passes.  The player who drew and played the initial card is the last to decide whether to play a card of higher value or not.  The player who played the highest value card in the pile gains the initial card into his or her collection; all other cards are discarded.  Players replenish their hands after the conclusion of this round and the next round begins with the next player.

Once a player has collected a pre-determined set of Character cards (based on their icons), he or she can call an end to the game.  The players tally their scores from the cards in their hand and collection, and add any bonuses (for ending the game, the collected Character cards, etc).  The player with the highest score is the winner.

6336,5 Card Nancy,2000,6.75,10,1,3,0,10,10,,Card Game Comic Book / Strip Humor Party Game ,Co-operative PlayHand ManagementStorytellingVoting,"5 Card Nancy is a card game invented by cartoonist Scott McCloud, author of Understanding Comics and Reinventing Comics, and creator of the Zot! series of comic books (among others).
 5 Card Nancy has never been published, so all existing sets have been constructed by hand.
 The game is essentially an exercise in collaborative storytelling, played with a deck of cards. Each card in the deck features a single, unique panel taken from Ernie Bushmiller's classic newspaper comic-strip Nancy. The strip is still in syndication today (and currently drawn by Guy Gilchrist), but McCloud insists that only panels from Bushmiller's peak years on the strip -- 1946 and later -- are suitable for use in a 5 Card Nancy deck.
 Game play is very simple: an initial card is selected randomly from the draw pile and placed face up on the table. This card will serve as the first panel in the collaborative comic strip that will emerge as a result of gameplay. On her turn, a player will then select a single card from her hand, and place that card face up and to the right of the emerging comic strip. A judge or judges (usually the other players) then vote on the appropriateness of that particular panel to the unfolding narrative. If majority opinion favors the proposed panel, it becomes a part of the strip, otherwise it returns to the hand of the player who proposed it.

McCloud describes the game as a Dada game, by which he means a game in the spirit of the Dada movement.

Players line their markers on the Its starting space, roll the die, move forward and try to reach the last space, an illustration of the Python foot. Should a marker land on certain spaces (rose stems and very long, Terry Gilliam-cartoon-like, winding arms), it goes backwards or forwards a certain number of spaces. A pretty simple, straightforward fare up until now, right? Right!
Now the Pythonian fun begins... Several spaces along the track are special and come in three different varieties: Task, Trivia and Character Type.

Task spaces require the active player to draw a Task card and perform the task described on it (e.g. Explain your theory on spontaneous combustion in which must be included goats, a kettle, Venus, a jelly babies and a sock with a hole in it). The other players then vote on the active players performance and, should the vote be positive, he gets an Award card (more on them later).

Trivia spaces require another player other than the active player do draw a Trivia card and read the Python-related question on it. If the answer is correct, another Award card is given.

Character types spaces have, well... character types on them (e.g. Canadian lumberjack, Spanish waiter, etc.) which the active player must take on as a persona until his next turn. If the other players decide he didnt put in enough of an effort, they can just move his marker back to the starting space...

Finally, the Award cards. Apart from some flavor, most of these cards serve no other purpose other than being able to display your proud array of awards. The ones that do have game text on them require the player to perform some sort of task until the end of the game to keep the award.

6358,Pack die Sieben,1996,0,0,0,3,6,45,45,,Dice ,Card DraftingRoll / Spin and Move,"Promotional family game, published by Mercedes Benz  Ravensburger.

Theme
A road trip with grandma, grandpa, mum, dad and three children, who all have to be put into the car so that you can be the first to reach the holiday destination.

Goal
Be the first to reach the finish line by successfully completing activities and being lucky in a roll-and-move part.

Game play
The game is divided into two phases:

In phase 1, players try to fill their car (= their player board) as fast as possible. They do so by completing tasks from the activity cards. 
The first area of the board shows a track consisting of spaces in six different colours. There is one pawn for all the players. Players take turns rolling the die and move the pawn accordingly. Depending on the colour of the space the pawn lands on, the active player has to 

     mime or draw one of two words from the card and the other players guess what it is, 
     read a story from the card and everyone guesses if it is true or false, 
     guess if the other players will raise an even or an odd number of fingers, 
     write down what they associate with a word, and the other players have to guess. 




Players who successfully complete a task and players who guess correctly get to spin a spinner showing the different family members. If they haven't already got this family member, they take a matching chip and put it on their player board. Otherwise they have to gift it to someone else.

If the pawn lands on a light or dark pink space, players play The magical 7 (trying to come as close as possible to 7 with two die rolls - the winner spins the spinner) or Spinner poker (betting one of your chips to get to spin the spinner twice - if the spinner points towards the family member you were betting on, you win that chip, otherwise you lose the one you bet).

Phase 2: Once a player has filled his/her car, he/she proceeds to the second part of the board. Here, each player has a car pawn. Players try to reach the finish line as fast as possible. Obstacle tokens and event spaces make you lose or win family members. If a player lands on a space that is already occupied, he/she can steal a family member to fill an empty spot in their own car.

The first player to reach the finish line wins the game.

6361,Ghost Train,1974,6.57143,14,1,2,4,20,20,Children's,Children's Game Dice Horror Maze ,Roll / Spin and Move,"(from the box)

A 3-Dimensional fearful fun game - but watch out!  The ghosts are out to get you.

Turn the wheels and run the gauntlet of ghastly ghouls!  Get caught in the spookey spider's web!  Sit with skeletons in the haunted waiting room!


Ghost Train is a British game based on those haunted amusement park rides.

The gameboard simulates the inside of a 'Ghost Train' complete with lurking ghosts, bats, skeletons and spiders, etc.

The mechanics (spinning tracks which change direction of movement) are the same as those in the Walt Disney Haunted Mansion Ride Game.

The game simulates many of the 'quirks' of such rides including sudden and jolting changes of direction, dead stops, being 'stuck' at one of the exhibits, and mechanical moving spooks.

Game Play:

Players enter the Ghost Train form the outside in little buggies and navigate the ride while being subjected to detours, directional changes, dead ends, delays and all sorts of creepy monsters.

Players can occasionally spin the turntables to either change a buggies direction (inside the circle) or have an attacked spook knock over an opponents buggy back (outside track) sending it to the 'waiting room'.

There is also a giant swinging spider guarding the exit!

Create poker hands - pairs, straights, flushes, etc. - to score points. After all the tiles have been played, the player with the highest score wins!

Contents
54 poker tiles including 2 jokers
Scoring chips: Blue = 5 points, Red = 10 points, White = 25 points
7 racks
Disk
Label
Score card

Set up
Players draw a tile from the quot;pool;quot; the one with the highest tile goes first, then play moves in a clockwise direction. Return those tiles to the pool and mix them.

Playing
On a turn, place a tile on one of the seven sides of the disk. Then take a tile from the pool so that you always have five tiles in your hand. Play continues to the second player who can place a tile after the tile just played, or on any of the other sides of the disk. Then he takes a tile from the pool. Players continue taking their turns until someone scores.

Scoring
Players score by making various poker hands: 1 Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, etc. (see POKER HANDS). The hands are formed by combining the last or quot;openquot; tiles in any of the paths leading from the disk.

Blocking
When you do not have a tile that you can lay down to score points, you may want to block the other players from scoring.

5 Tile Plays
Any time a player scores by creating a 5 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, Flush, Straight Flush, Royal Flush after receiving his points for that round, ALL of those tiles that were used to score are turned face down so that they cannot be used again. Players can play tiles from their hands off of the turned down tiles, as if starting from the beginning (tiles placed before the turned-down tiles cannot be used to form hands).

Note: Do not turn the tiles over upon creating 2 pairs and 4 of a Kind. This allows for the creation of a Full House and 5 of a Kind.

Jokers
A joker can be used as a quot;Wild Cardquot; to represent a ny tile. (Color does not matter - a red joker can represent a spade or club, etc.) The player that places a joker determines what tile it represents; the joker will remain as that chosen tile for the rest of the game. If another player holds the tile that the joker represents, he can play that tile as well.

Points Chart
Some of the scoring in Star Poker differs from the scoring in the standard poker game. This is due to the probabilities of creating different hands.

1 Pair = 5 pts.
2 Pairs = 10 pts.
3 of a Kind = 30 pts.
4 of a Kind = 75 pts.
5 of a Kind = 100 pts.
Full House = 40 pts.
Straight = 50 pts.
Flush = 50 pts.
Straight Flush = 100 pts.
Royal Flush = 100 pts.
Blue Chips = 5 pts.
Red Chips = 10 pts.
White Chips = 25 pts.

Ending and Winning the Game
Players continue until there are no more tiles to draw from and all tiles in their hands have been placed. In a four player game, once a player draws the tile that leaves two tiles left, the game ends after that player takes his turn. In a five player game, play until there are four tiles left and in a seven player game, play until five tiles are left. The player with the most points wins.

6377,Up Periscope,1975,5.5,13,1,2,2,45,45,Wargames,Nautical Wargame World War II ,Secret Unit Deployment,"Each player has four merchant ships which they are trying to race across their own side of the board to the home port. They also have a submarine (which can attack the merchants) and a destroyer (which can counter-attack the sub).

The game is basically like Battleships with movement. The cool part of the game is the board.

The board stands up vertically and each player plays his own side of the board. The ships stay in place as their bases are short pegs that fit pretty tightly in holes on the board. The board is made of a sandwich of two thick card boards with a thin sheet of rubbery plastic in between, so you can't see which holes your opponents ships are in. But you can push your torpedo and depth charge through the hole, stretching out the rubber and popping your opponents ship off the board. Coolest physical game mechanic ever! No, wait, it gets better! At the bottom of the board is a periscope. Yes, it really has mirrors. You slide this left and right to any column of the board, and then peek through the eyepiece to sight the enemy. You get a view of one column of the board and a peripheral view of the columns each side. If you get a sighting of an opponents ship on the central column you can try and estimate the range and torpedo it. The enemy destroyer then gets a shot at counterattacking your sub. The view through the periscope looks just like looking out from a sub and seeing ships peeping out of the ocean (nicely painted board) along the line of sight. Absolutely the coolest physical game mechanic ever!!!

Board: 13 x 13 square grid

Pieces each side: 4 Merchant ships, 1 Sub, 1 Destroyer, 1 Torpedo, 1 Depth Charge

The players in this game represent game wardens who try to follow the tracks of the poachers through Africa to their hiding place in order to arrest them, meeting many exotic animals along the way.

During the game, the players move their pawns on the spaces marked 1 to 36 and pick up the small tracking tiles, which show them, where the tracks of the poachers lead. Each player on his destination sheet draws in the tracks that he has uncovered. With each game, there is only one set of continuous tracks from the space marked 1 up to one of the hiding places (spaces A through K).

The goal of the game is to follow this continuous set of tracks and discover which hiding place the poachers are using. A player that knows or believes he knows the correct hiding place can arrest poachers from that space. The winner is the player who arrests the most poachers from the correct hiding place.

During setup, twelve pins are put in the holes, and both players now place two elastic bands (Warp Bands) from one board side to another, wrapping them around the pins.

The object of the game is to free your Warp Bands (those placed by your opponent) so that they no longer touch a pin. To accomplish this, both players take turns in which they place a pin on the board and remove another pin. This placement is restricted: each hole on the boards shows one of six symbols, and the hole from which a pin is removed must carry the same symbol as the hole in which a pin is placed.

Players use the rolls of regular dice to place pirates on the island, move them around, and dig (by turning the island dice to higher numbers).  Digging far enough gets you treasure chips and the object is to be the first to get chips valued at 15 gold.

There is a tactical variant in which players get action points to spend each turn instead of rolling dice.

The game was originally published in 1989 under the slightly different title of Kp'ten Buddel (in a limited edition of 100 copies), and then re-released in 1992 in Abacus' white-box series.  In the later version the treasure chips are pulled from a bag, in the earlier version they are picked up with a magnet on a stick (the chip colors are also a bit different).

Espionage is an advanced roll and move game similar to the Project KGB games from the same time period.  Each player tryies to be the first to move their four spies from Mission Control to the waiting helicopters in the Abandoned Airfield.  Along the way there are various pitfalls to slow the players down and cloak and dagger spaces which require drawing a card and doing what it says.  Movement is handled by rolling the two dice and either moving one spy the sum of the two dice or two spies the amount shown on one die (i.e., a roll of 2  3 means you can move one spy 5 spaces or one spy 2 spaces and a different spy 3 spaces).  Landing on an enemy spy sends that spy back to the nearest safe area, so the game is cut-throat to be sure.

Towards the end of the board, at the Guerrilla Camp, players draw a letter card for each spy that they want to pass through to the airfield.  The requirement is that the player be able to spell out a word with their letter cards in order to win the game (four letter cards - one for each spy).  If a player doesn't like the letter they drew, they can return it to the deck and wait until their next turn to draw another.

Pan is played with a deck of 320 cards (8 standard decks with the 8's, 9's, and 10's removed -- no Jokers).  Each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards.  The winner of the hand is the first person to meld 11 cards (his 10 card hand plus a draw).  Certain melds are called conditions and result in the player collecting chips from the other players.  There are rules regarding what is a valid meld, folding at the beginning of the hand, and so on.  Check out the link to the rules at U.S. Playing Card Co., if you are interested.

Deep Sea Duel is the name of the entry-level starter deck for the game and at least one expansion was released to expand the game.  In the game, players attempt to talk customers in different locations into trying a nice Krusty Krab Krabby Patty.  You win the game either by katching 4 customers each from different locations, 4 customers from the same location, or a mixture of both.

Play begins by drawing a hand of 5 cards, taking a card from the separate Location deck, and placing it in one of 4 slots in the middle.  The potential katcher (active player) may then play a Katcher from their hand under a location to attempt to katch it.  (They may play up to 2 Katchers under two separate locations, but both are played at the same time.)  The opposing player can attempt to stop the katch by playing a strategy card from their hand, or playing a Katcher of their own from their hand.  Players go back and forth in this Showdown until one does not want to, or cannot, respond.

The last Katcher played by each player is compared, and the one with the highest Patty Pouch wins.  If the potential katcher won, they take the Location card.  If the opposing player wins, they have stopped the katch and the Location card remains on the board.  Once a turn is over, both players may discard up to 2 cards if they wish, and then both draw until they have 5 cards in hand each.

6475,3 SPOT game,1996,5.26,25,2,2,2,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Tile Placement,"From Mr. de Bono's website:
The intention was to produce the simplest possible game that could be played with a high degree of skill. An attempt was made to fulfill the following conditions:

1. A minimum number of playing pieces, preferably one each. 
The smallest possible board.

2. A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.

3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.

4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play for ever.

The object is to score 12 points provided that the other player scores at least 6 points - if the other player scores less than six points then the player reaching 12 points is the loser! Whereas in most games the person scoring the highest number of points is the winner - in the 3 Spot game the 'winner' can be the 'loser'.

Points are scored by the position of the tiles on the board which is a 3x3 grid. You can try to score the points you need, or force your opponent to take points.

Cyber-Sea by Delmer Esau is a new version of an independent board game for two to four players. Like the original game, The Fish Tank, each player of this game controls a team of soldiers including a ronin, a hacker, and three foot soldiers on a mission to rescue a genetic super fish. Well, rescue may be a little overly noble. Steal the genetic super-fish is a more accurate description of the game mission. Naturally, in the world of undersea warfare, the competition is fierce so killing as many of the enemy is a possibly close second game objective. The teams fight each other, while having to overcome locked hatchways, flooded chambers, and automatic guns. The game is available from RPGNow.com in electronic PDF format. To play, all the components have to be printed out with subsequent cutting, folding, and possibly even gluing required.

From the product website:

Infiltrate a Pacifica research facility with your hired Ronin and their mercenary team. Hack the installation computer net with your Fader. Lay down the firepower with the Gun-suit heavy combat unit. Kick ass. Take names. Then put the game away till you do it again the next day...

At the second level, a random load chip is drawn and added to each of the five state cards.  The winner is the first player to connect up all five states plus the states that produce the loads (the coastal states requirement is dropped).

A spinner is spun each turn to determine how many (adjacent) states a player can hook up to their line.

IBB has a ton of stuff in it including a combat magic system for Priests and Wizards.

Volume IV in the Down in Flames card game series covers World War II in the Pacific from mid-1942 until early 1945, starting where Volume III (Zero!) left off.

Corsairs  Hellcats is a DiF Gamette, including all of the major late war aircraft types developed by both sides (Zero! is required in order to play this gamette). Allied players can fly the game's namesakes, the F4U-1 Corsair and F6F Hellcat, as well as the British Firefly, the P47-N, and the P-61 Black Widow. Japanese players can counter with two models of late war Zero, the Ki-84 Frank, the N1K1 George, and the J2M Jack. New bomber types include the TBF Avenger, the B-29 Superfortress, and the Ki-49 Helen. There's even a new kind of bomber: the Attack Bomber, which can strafe and bomb. Two types are present in Corsair  Hellcats: the B-25C-1 field modification and the solid nose B-25J, which carried a dozen (!) fixed forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns.

All of these aircraft (plus many of the ones in Zero!) are used in seven new campaigns. Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz are carrier campaigns like those pioneered in Zero!. Solomon Islands, Philippines 1944, and Okinawa use the land campaign structure familiar to players of the previous games in the series. The other two campaigns are quite different, though. Guadalcanal models the drawn out struggle for control of the airspace above that island. Players allocate available aircraft to two missions each week in an attempt to force a withdrawal by their opponent. The campaign also includes the option to play the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz campaigns as part of the battle, feeding the results of the carrier encounters back into the main campaign. B-29s in China is a solitaire campaign representing the beginning of the strategic bombing offensive against Japan. The player controls three Superfortresses and must balance their activities between training, carrying supplies, repairing damage, and conducting bombing missions.

In addition, Corsairs  Hellcats includes new target types, skilled pilots, and ordnance. The game also has rules for Kamikazes, supply drops, submarines, and mine laying. There's even a new method of selecting skilled (and green) pilots and crews that reflects the changes in aircrew quality that both sides went through during the course of the war. Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of your Corsair or Hellcat? Pilots, man your planes...

NOTE: In order to play Corsairs  Hellcats you must have a copy of Zero!.

If the player#039;s movement card took them to the appropriate spot on the board to return the shot, then they get to play an action card.

This game is an updated version of the earlier Pan-Kai by the same author, to which Universe adds the three and four players variants.

The game box featured publicity stills from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.  In the movie, one of astronauts plays Universe with Hal (the computer). This scene was cut and replaced with Dave playing Chess with Hal. The director thought it would be more understandable by the audience.

The game doesn't mention puzzles, but there are plenty of patterns to try to make with the pentominoes. For example, form a 5x12 rectangle, or a 6x10 rectangle, with one set of pieces.

The two player form of this game was published in 1961 as Pan-Kai

6550,Good Old Houses,1981,4.5,2,0,2,8,30,30,Children's,Children's Game Educational Puzzle ,,"The game consists of eight puzzles of houses representing different architectural styles popular in American history. There is a series of games for different age levels, all designed to familiarize players with these architectural styles.

From the rules:
GOOD OLD HOUSES is a series of games about American architecture. The objective in all the games is to entertain while building an awareness of some basic architectural styles. The houses in this set are illustrations of general styles rather than portrayals of specific, existing buildings. (Neighborhood houses seldom show all the style traits illustrated here. In some houses only a single feature makes a style recognizable, while in others there is a mixture of style traits.) The range of styles, from Federal to Bungalow, isn't intended to encompass the breadth of American architectural history, but to represent the basic building styles most frequently employed between the late 18th and early 20th centuries when the greatest thrust of settlement and urban development occurred in the United States. After playing the games in GOOD OLD HOUSES, players will be more observant of houses in their own neighborhoods and better able to describe what they see.

The eight house puzzles (12 pieces per puzzle) are used in four different games for 2 to 8 players. The games are divided into three levels determined by age: under 8, 8 and over, 10 and over.

6561,Cashflow 202,1999,5.93727,55,2.7143,2,6,180,180,,Economic Educational Expansion for Base-game Math Number ,Betting/WageringCommodity SpeculationPaper-and-PencilRoll / Spin and MoveSet CollectionSimulation,"Cashflow 202 is an expansion to Cashflow 101 that focuses on Technical Investing including a simple system for options and short sales. The expansion pack is a new set of four decks of cards and new player sheets to handle the new investments possible. It is unplayable without Cashflow 101.

Components:
Capital Gain Deal cards replace the Small Deal deck.
Cash Flow Deals replace the Big Deal deck.
A new deck of more punishing Doodad cards replaces the 101 Doodad cards. 
42 Market cards replace the 101 Market deck.
Stock shorting envelopes for each player for the two major stocks players can make short sales in. (Unfortunately with glue still on the envelope flaps that people will invariably forget and lick shut.)
(4 cassette tapes on investing.)

Major rule changes
Market Deck is now reshuffled after drawing 25 cards, removing the guarantee that all Market cards will be played.
Also, a new rule exists that attempts to fix how the Market deck was under drawn with 2-4 players. Now landing in the Rat Race on either an Opportunity or Market space causes you to draw both a Deal card (your choice still large or small) and a Market card each time.
In the Fast Track, landing on a business you already own allows you to franchise it. Pay the down payment, add an additional token, and receive the additional cashflow listed on the board again.

Players not only start by filling out their sheet with a ?career? as before, but also randomly draw a starting investment portfolio as well.

The game is definitely more chaotic and not as idiot-proof as Cashflow 101, and investments can be entirely wiped out. The game teaches gambling theory and cash management. For instance, if a bet only wins 1 in 20 times, but pays off 50:1 when it does, this is a good bet. The issue then is cash management through the losing cycle placing bets steadily while waiting for the payoff.

The object of the game is to navigate your ship out to the fishing grounds and return safely with a catch of fish which are sold at market.  The prices of the market are controlled by cards.  The price of half of the fishing commodities are known and the other half hidden at all times.  Navigation out to the fishing grounds is done by rolling of die.  In addition, there are wind currents to speed up movement and shallows and rocks to avoid.  The paths closer to the rocks are riskier, but generally faster.  A collision with rocks causes a shipwreck and the loss of your catch.

The first person to reach the agreed upon amount of money (through selling fish at market) is the winner.

Sabuca is a tricky little word game that is made all the more difficult by the time limit and ability for other players to end things before you are ready. This lends the game a frantic, tense feel and this is something that will likely be favored by the word smiths out there. The nature of trying to unscramble other player's words adds Sabuca a level of depth as it almost forms a game within a game.

There are 6 main characters who are encouraged to dress in costume but not required, plus a game leader.  But other guests at the party can ask questions and vote on who they think did it.

The six main characters in this story are members of a club similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, but they#039;ve sworn off evil-doings:
Hagatha GrubThe Activities Director is a wicked old witch who cackles often, sometimes for no apparent reason. Hunched shoulders under black clothing complete with pointy hat, she frequently pets her only friend, her cat.

Professor Trixie GimmickThe Club#039;s Technical Administrator who runs the club website is an ultimate techo-geek. She prefers machines over people and plays with gadgets all the time, getting a little annoyed when people interrupt her work to talk to her.

Vanessa Van AvariceThe club Secretary is a beautiful vamp, vain, ruthless and very greedy. She flirts with all the men and is catty to all the women.

Captain Brutus LeCad Would you trust a former pirate as Club Treasurer?

Morley KruptA former gangster makes a great Security Officer.

Barnaby UnderwoodThe club Vice President is a stereotypical villain from melodramas. He constantly twirls his large black mustache and has an evil laugh. He doesn#039;t understand why everyone yells quot;booquot; every time his name is spoken.

World War II in the West gives you control of all of the major participating nations that fought World War II, and allows you to play a simple yet accurate portrayal of the war. World War II in the West was originally designed for play with Axis and Allies figures and rule, but is now a stand-alone game which includes over 1,600 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces if they wish.

In fact, World War II in the West can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.

With World War II in the West, you fight for the convoy routes, have air battles over London, conduct landing operations on the northern French coast, outflank and surround forces on the Eastern Front, and manage the industrial output of your nation.

World War II in the West includes over 1,600 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, South African, Czech, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known Spanish Blue Division that fought on the Eastern Front with the German Army.

The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 50 by 40 inches. Also included is a smaller East African map to be used in play. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 150km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.

The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from September 1939 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Two scenarios are included with the game allowing you to play the war in Africa or Operation Overlord in a shorter time than the campaign game. Also, new scenarios will be posted on the website.
 World War II in the Wests complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history  more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional  counter wargames as its complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.

World War II in the West can be combined with World War II in the East to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!

As a solo puzzle, the player tries to connect the 48 rhombs, which have thick branches or thin vines on their edges, into one continuous picture.
As a competitive game, 35 or 36 tiles (depending on the number of players) are dealt out among the players. The remaining tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player now tries to connect his/her tiles into one picture. Players can take turns taking tiles from the table. A player who took a tile is allowed to put one back there as well, but that is not mandatory, so players can opt to increase the number of their tiles.  
When no one can place any more tiles, the scoring starts. All tiles a player couldn't use counts 2 negative points.

The game uses a board filled with squares that the room tiles are secretly placed on. There are 5 scenarios included with the game, each with different objectives for winning the game. One is Hydra, where the object is, what else.. to kill the Hydra. Battle Royale is a fight to the death in the dungeon. One has you placing a flame sword in the middle of the dungeon and then getting out. One has you trying to rescue 'Yohko' and get back out of the dungeon, and the last has you trying to get 'Satan's Ring' and escape from the dungeon with it.

The categories are:

Soaps: Peyton Place, Dallas and beyond Another World
Cartoons: Bugs Bunny, The Flintstones, Pink Panther and more
Space: Sputnik to Star Wars, Buck Rogers to Apollo
Famous Pairs: Antony and Cleopatra to Bette Davis' eyes
Advertising Slogans: Memorable lines that sold us all
Fairplay: If it's trivia, it's eligible

The back of the box promised three more sets of Forte Trivia Cards.  Forte Trivia Cards Volume II has a BGG entry, although its description says it contained only 363 cards instead of the promised 1000.  But Volumes 3 and 4 were, to the best of my knowledge, never produced.

There were some good questions, but a bunch of gamers in their twenties had no idea for the answers to the Soaps questions.

Each player has five pieces with the letters B, L, A, R or F printed on one side and A on the other. On each turn, players roll a six-sided die and move one piece the number of spaces indicated in the direction allowed for that piece, or in any direction if the piece is resting on a free (black) square. Then the moved piece is flipped over. Landing upon a free square earns an extra turn. Capturing opposing pieces is by displacement, but capture by jumping is also allowed on a roll of two. Any capture also earns an extra turn. Moving a piece up against the edge of the board indicated by its letter, thus making further moves with that piece impossible, causes that piece to be removed. The last player with pieces remaining on the board wins.

The players must answer questions pertaining to their chosen character. The first who completes a predetermined circuit wins.

The questions are general knowledge, historic, cultural, weird... :

- For the Writer: What kind of animal did Grard de Nerval take out for a walk at the Palais-Royal ?
- For the Musician: In which famous club did Boris Vian play jazz ?
- For the Cemetery Keeper: What did Cyrano of Bergerac and Molire have in common ?

The characters were drawn by the French artist Tignous.

I find it interesting to combine variable powers with a trivia game.

 Players randomly choose one of 10 character cards which depict one of the cast of characters.  Accountant, Bootblack, Clergyman, Doctor, Editor, Financier, Grandfather, Hobo, Investigator, Judge. Places which players visit as they move around the board give clues as to who they are. The Hobo for example can visit the Soup Kitchen, The Police Station, The Bus Line and The Drug Store - but, of course, cannot visit the Country Club. Players try to guess the identity of their opponents while remaining unidentified themselves. Disguise Caps spaces on the board allow players to move onto spaces they normally would not be allowed to visit. The winner is the player who manages to conceal his identity from the other players until he alone remains in the game.

Each player runs a team of 4, 5 or 6 racers, teamwork between the racers helps to improve the position of the team's racers through slip-streaming. 
There are four short stages and 2 long (mountain) stages to the full race, but a lesser number could be raced over. There are 34 (green) random movement ( event) cards: nine '1's, 13 '2's , nine '3's and one '4', a hunger/fall card and a weakness/blackout card. Each player also holds a pack of 9 yellow cards. one '+5', one '+3' one '+2' three '+1's, a spare wheel, a food musette (musette = In cycling, a bag containing food handed out in a feed zone of a multi-stage race such as the Tour de France) , and a 'Baraka'. (which means good luck in French slang.) On their turn the active player draws a random card for each of their racers, and if desired adds one of their yellow cards. Yellow cards are discarded for the stage after play. 
If a racer ends his move with one space between him and the player of his team ahead of him, then he can slip-stream into the space provided it is not filled by racers of other teams. A racer can also slipstream another team's racer if there is a completely empty road space between them. Roads are 4, 3 or two riders wide, depending upon the terrain.
The winner can be decided by shortest number of turns taken to complete the course, or by placing in the finishing order of each stage - (better to agree this in advance). The short stages can take between 30 and 60 minutes, and the long stages 60 to 90. A lot depends upon the number of players, and of racers per team. If the whole race is to be run is would be best to spell it over a weekend with some other games filling between stages.

6728,Bartok,1985,7.00417,24,1.5,2,10,120,120,Abstract,Card Game Humor Party Game ,Hand ManagementMemory,"Bartok is a game that is remarkably similar to UNO, at least initially. It is played with one or more decks of cards - I play with a shoe box of old, partly complete packs :)

There the similarities end:

1. If you only have one card left, you have to say 'Bartok'. If you don't, you get your hand made back up to maximum.

2. Most other rules violations require you to take one or more cards.

3. Players aren't allowed to ask questions during a game. Ask a question, take a card. This is most entertaining when someone comes along and asks 'What are you playing?'. They'll usually get a card, and then several more when they don't say Bartok.

4. This is the doozy: A player that successfully gets rid of his last card is deemed the winner for that round, and gets to make a new rule, which overrides any later rules. These can be as simple or as brain-hurty as you like. Usually the game gets harder as it progresses, as rules feed off each other and make lethal feedback loops.

5. Some example rules, to give you an idea of the flavor of the game:

When a change of suit changes color, play direction reverses. (easy)
When a two is played, play skips a player. (easy)
Threes don't exist. (somewhat metaphysical)
When a black ace is played, each player must slap a card face down in the middle of the table. The last player to do so takes all of the other cards. (moderate, more of a wakey wakey rule)
When a black queen is played, all of the cards increment their values by one, with kings wrapping to become aces. Red queens decrement the values by one. (somewhat mind numbing)
Prime numbered cards swap to become the suit of the same colour - ie. clubs - spades, diamonds - hearts. (brain hurty, especially when combined with the rule above)

Any rule disputes are usually settled by voting.

You play until you're bored, or until someone creates a win condition and manages to achieve it.

SURGEON-GENERAL'S WARNING: Do not play this game with mathematicians :)

Up to eight players attempt to successfully navigate the Alaska-Canada Highway from Seattle, Washington to Anchorage, Alaska. The object of the game is to arrive in Anchorage with the most money, which is found through panning for gold, visiting gold mines, and other events along the way. Hazards that players encounter during game play duplicate some of the real-life problems motorists may face driving to Alaska's largest city, such as icy roads, landslides, bears, and everybody's favorite, a boarded-up gas station in the middle of nowhere. 
Solid production values here, with some colorful cartoon-style graphics on the Encounter Cards and game board. There's a prospector's poke containing some exquisite pewter playing pieces (a la Monopoly) that include a moose, a jeep, a bush plane, and a dog sled, among others. The game has plenty of Yukon Sam Bucks provided in various denominations, along with a handy storage tray, and is topped off with a pair of substantial dice and a Rainbow Road/Pan For Gold spinner.

Bonaparte is a game of strategy in which players simulate all the Napoleonic campaigns in Europe starting from 1807, from that time on, in fact, the conflict between France and England was decidedly in the hands of Napoleon. All the various campaigns (Spain, Portugal, Prussia, Austria, etc) were not considered separate and isolated from one another, as they were in reality. The necessity to count battles on two, three, or four fronts as all being connected is dictated by several historical assumptions: the numbers of enemies to face, the blocking off of England, which was likely to become a way to isolate France on the continent, and the British tenacity in arousing national anti-French sentiments. Napoleon's goal is to conquer all of Europe, without which the financial possibilities of the English would render impossible the existence of the empire. The play of alliances, created according to the political and military mechanisms which are always unstable, is an instrument equally valid foe either player to use in order to obtain a victory which only the forces of the two individual countries could not obtain, even in theory.

6747,Batman: Poker gegen Joker,1989,5.59524,21,2,2,2,20,20,,Card Game ,,"This is a game about the first Batman movie. The notorious Joker attempts to bring the cities under his control and Batman comes to save the day!
One of the players takes the role of the Dark Knight and the other one that of the Joker.

Gameplay:
Each player takes a stack of cards that correspond to his character according to the symbols to the back of the cards.
From the City maps the two cards with zero are discarded, the remaining City maps are juxtaposed in the center of the pitch.
The City tickets are each rotated to their current owners, with each player at the beginning of 4 is City Card. 
Joker starts the game and then players alternately play.
There are two types of cards: Power cards and Action cards
On his turn the active player takes the top card of his own deck of cards. The card is then applied to the City maps. Just keep in mind that there are power and action cards.
The City maps are quite large. They show a numerical value of 0-4 and a symbol of Batman or Joker.

The Cards:
1) Power Cards: Each player has in his deck 36 power cards with values ​​from 1 to 12, each card is available three times. A maximum of four cards can be applied on the City maps.
2) KO Card: This card means that the opposing player is obligated to discard the next card that he draws.
3) Stop card: it is placed under a City map. Players use them on the opposing side of the city. Their effect is that the opponent can only go to that city with power cards valued 1 and no other value. 
4) Tchomb cards: They can also be stored underneath a city map on the opposing side rendering the cards already there worthless (they now have 0 value)
5) Attack Card: Will be played on an opponent's row and the player can take a power card from that row.
6) Change Map: Players switch roles and change sides.

The game ends in the round in which neither player can do more to create a map. 
The City cards are counted and they are considered to belong to the player who has the higher total numbers on the power cards. In case of a tie, neither player wins the City map. City maps that have been conquered, that belonged to the other players at the start get an extra point to their printed score.
The player with the highest total score wins the game.

Attack! Expansion will add quite a bit of detail while retaining playability.  Players will be able to choose from many new options including (They will get 3 per turn): Moving Military Units, Playing Political Cards, Attempting a Diplomatic Blitz, Beginning a Trade Route Auction, Purchasing Units, Researching a New Technology, Trading with another Player, or a Strategic Move (Land, Sea, or Air).

Politics: Each player nation and each minor nation will have one of the four political affiliations: Fascist, Monarchy, Democracy, or Communism. Political cards will allow the players to influence the minor nations governments with propaganda, or even overthrow them in an attempt to install a friendly government that they can then influence to join their sphere. Other diplomatic cards will allow players to spy on each other or perform various internal political actions.

Trade Routes: Players will be able to bid on Trade Route cards. The highest bidder gets the card. Trade cards act just like any other economic card, except they are wild cards and may be used to create sets. They also usually have higher than normal economic values. The downside to Trade Route cards is that they may be blocked or destroyed by blockades or Submarine warfare.

Technology: After the initial expansion, players usually begin to build alliances and the wars begin. Having a technology that gives you an advantage on the battlefield is critical. Players may spend an action (and money) attempting to develop a special technology.

Oil: Oil also takes on its historical importance in Attack! Expansion. Every time a player moves tank, air, or naval units, they must spend oil units from their reserve. The oil reserve may only be replenished when oil cards are used to do so rather than used in a player's economy that turn.

Attack! and Attack! Expansion will contain the same quality art and components featured in other Eagle-Gryphon Games products.

The Cold War heats up on your kitchen table, as Red launches it's nuclear arsenal of ICBM's, IRBM's, and Strategic Bombers against Blue's air defense command. 
Blue occupies two thirds of the table with his cities, missile silos, radar sites, and surface-to-air missiles, while Red lurks menacingly behind his Fail-Safe Line, awaiting the go-codes to unleash Armageddon. 
Supplied components are a rulebook, the cardboard pieces that you must cut out, and a pad of Missile Attack/Defense Order sheets. Players must supply two different colored dice and a meter stick. 
(A sharp pencil and a calculator are recommended as well.)
Despite involving a somewhat greater-than-usual amount of record-keeping, both players quickly find themselves in a tense battle of nuclear bluff and counter-bluff. 
Are those incoming blips merely a Red ruse, or is that The Real Thing building up behind Red's Fail Safe Line? 
Should Blue strip the air defenses of his cities to assure his getting off a retaliatory ICBM strike against Red, or protect his populace and risk obliteration of his missile silos?
Overall, a tight, well-balanced table-topper 
It never plays the same way twice.

Ultimate Rummy is a card game that consists of five or ten progressive hands.  Each hand played requires one more card than the last for its initial meld.  The object of each hand is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.  After making your initial meld, you layoff [sic] cards on any meld in play in order to get rid of your cards and go out.  Special decks of cards are used which includes [sic] 6 wild cards called Swirls.  The winner of each hand scores the value of all the cards that remain in the hands of the opponents.

From the credits:
Ultimate Rummy is based upon a version of Rummy known as Contract Rummy.  People may know Contract Rummy by different names, such as Joker Rummy, King Rummy, Progressive Rummy or Shanghai Rummy.  What they all have in common is a fixed number of deals, with each deal having a prefixed goal.  Ultimate Rummy is not so much a creation of one individual, as it is a perfection of the Rummy games that have preceded it.  We therefore must give credit to all the players who over the years have added their own nuances in seeking to achieve the 'ultimate' rummy game.

You play Convoy cards hidden and try to take them across (accumulate 4000 nautical miles). When an Alert is played, the convoy is vulnerable to attack by warships (carrier beats destroyer beats frigate and so on down to the sub, but two subs beat the carrier); if you cannot defend against the attack, your convoy is sunk (score is based on the convoy's tonnage). Otherwise it survives and the alert is passed. You can play an End of Alert, of course. Two Airplane cards in a row (by the same player) will also sink the convoy; the Airplane Hit card defends. The Mine sinks the convoy outright unless a Minesweeper is played. The Storm slows you down but you cannot be attacked except by the Mine. You can fly the Neutral pavilion, which protects you against anything but the Mine.

Radar cards can reveal the convoy's value. This may be good, revealing the decoy Fishing Trawler (of no value), or bad --the revealed convoy is worth double, either to the sinker or the player!

The game is played in several hands until a set score is reached.

A tile may have nothing, a chest, a monster or a skull on it.  Combat with monsters is a simple dicing affair.  The chest rules are unclear; it seems they're used to store stuff (since your hand of cards is normally limited to three).

6844,Rags To Riches,2003,5.16667,3,0,2,4,120,120,,Economic ,Roll / Spin and MoveStock Holding,"RAGS TO RICHES is a dice-based stock trading game where each player races to accumulate enough wealth to build his/her own luxury mansion and retire to a quiet life.

The mechanics of the game are quite simple.  Players move around the board, buying and selling stock shares in hopes of creating a profit for themselves so that they can make even bigger investments later on.  Stock prices are always determined by a dice-roll, so prices move up and down quickly and randomly.  Certain safe stocks don't move around in price that much and offer higher dividends, while riskier stocks are much more volatile, but tend to offer higher returns.  The challenge is for each individual player to determine how much money he/she can afford to risk in any particular situation since an unlucky dice roll can wipe that player out.

There is also a simple, yet elegant means of borrowing money in this game.  Players are allowed to borrow money from the bank as long as they pay back double the borrowed amount by the time that his/her token completes two full turns around the board.  This helps to make the game more strategic since players will often find themselves in need of extra cash which they can only borrow with a pretty high interest penalty.

Overall, RAGS TO RICHES is a nice blend of strategy and luck (probably 70% strategy, 30% luck).  The games typically last around 120 minutes (depending on who is playing) and usually keeps everyone in the game until the very end.

Each turn two dice are rolled with two different pieces being moved along interconnecting lines between or into cities. A warrior which lands on a piece removes it from the board. An emperor landing on a piece removes it from the board. An emperor passing over an opposition warrior paralyzes it with a white disc until an emperor from its color lands on it. Pieces landing on paralyzed pieces or pieces of their own color move to the next square. Towns are taken over by moving two warriors into them. When this happens any opposition pieces still in the city are removed from the board and one of each type may be returned to the board by the invader.

6876,Lee vs. Meade,1974,5.4,21,2,2,2,360,360,Wargames,American Civil War Wargame ,Simulation,"The Battle of Gettysburg was fought in July 1, 1863 until July 3rd of the same year. It took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. 
It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war's turning point.
Union Major General George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This battle put an end to Lee's plans for an invasion of the North.

Lee vs Meade is a game that covers the Battle of Gettysburg. It was the first game in a series of games put out by Rand known as the 'Command Series Volume I'.  The later version put out by Gamut of Games featured a mounted map-board while the original Rand Games version had a map on heavy paper.
Lee vs. Meade has a 17X17 map 72 counters(36 for each player) combat charts and turn records charts along with a rulebook.  The scale used is 1/2 mile per square and each unit is considered to be an entire division.  The two-color map is mainly green but there are also some hills and ridges. There is a clearly shown road network of the area as well as terrain that are suitable for defensive outposts.

The map of the Gettysburg area is broken up into a 12x12 square grid.  This grid system was used in several of the games developed by Rand Game Associates and was called the Time/Space Grid. Movement costs necessary to go from one square to the next are visible on the grid at the edges and corners between the squares making it easier to move without the use of a movement chart. Unlike some games that use a square grid, diagonal movement is permitted.

Another feature common to most of the games offered by Rand Games was fairly elaborate combat sub-routine in which the attacker and defender would each pick a combat method from a 6x6 matrix called the Tactical Analysis Chart and draw the appropriate Tac Card. These Tac Cards are numbered from 1 to 6. The cell on the Tactical Analysis Chart that corresponds to the intersection of the two players' combat methods determines which combat results table is used. There are 6 different types of CRT used in this game.

The turn sequence is easy. Firstly the Confederate army moves.Any combat resulting is resolved and then the Union army moves and any combat is resolved.
In order to initiate a combat you have to move your units onto a square edge that contains enemy units. 
There are four different scenarios in the game. A different time of the battle is used in each one and different victory conditions are required for each one.

In the historical battle, the US Second Marine Division had 3 days to clear the island of Japanese soldiers.  The bloody battle inflicted nearly 3,000 casualties on the Marines; only 17 of 4,700 Japanese soldiers survived.  The solitaire game places the player in command of the US forces to determine how he or she performs compared to the historical outcome.

A map overlaid with a hexagonal grid forms the game's playing field.  In the middle lies the isle of Tarawa, surrounded by water.  The terrain and Japanese defenses are also printed out, as well as the US-designated landing beaches.  Each turn, the player receives an amount of forces to deploy onto the beaches.  He or she handles attacks between the two armies, rolling dice and checking tables to resolve their effects.  When the Marines has defeated the Japanese in a hex, a cleared marker is placed on it (and removed if the US forces retreat from the hex due to a counterattack).  If the Japanese attack is particularly effective, the Marines suffers casualties, which is reflected by moving a marker on the Casualty Track.  The player also has to concern him- or herself with booby traps, snipers, air raids, morale, and supply.

The game ends at the end of the third turn.  The player wins if all hexes of the island are cleared and the Casualty Track reflects less than 5,000 casualties.

Each is assigned to one or more of nineteen industries. Changes in prices of the stocks of each company are noted on the gameboard using a china marker.

Each player begins with $15,000 and a sheet of blank stock certificates on which to record purchases and sales. The pawn, there is only one for all players to move, is placed on 'start'. The space on which the pawn rests tells the player to obey a chance card, or more likely, which industries stock prices will rise and fall on the next turn.

A player's turn begins with the roll of the dice to determine how much each affected stock has changed. (There is a chance table for each stock.) The pawn is advanced the number rolled and the player who rolled the dice may purchase as much stock of one company and sell as much of another company desired.

The players play until the end of the time limit agreed upon. The players cash in their stocks and the one with the most money wins.

The latest version (2002) is currently available for download from the BoardGameGeek files section below.

Two to six players control primitive gliders descending into a deep, sheer-walled pit. Within this natural arena the glider pilots engage in ritualistic gladiatorial combat. A combination of martial and flying skills is required for victory. Every decision a player makes, from the selection of weapons to the anticipation of fickle air currents, helps determine whether a gladiator is on the road to glory... or disaster.

The object of the game is simply to have the last glider airborne. The game features a variable player turn order (depending on the altitude and speed of each glider), five different types of weapons (including ranged weapons and nets), risky ramming attacks, and up/down drafts. Players have the option of controlling more than one glider (up to three each in a two-player game). The competition may be a last man flying free-for-all or the players can form competing teams of gliders.

The experimental Campaign Expansion rules allow you to play a continuing gladiator character. The Expansion includes rules for Character Survival, Experience, and Special Abilities and Advantages. Gladiator characters who survive a match (and aren't crippled in the process) receive experience and a chance to gain special abilities and advantages. Gladiators who are victorious are more likely develop skills that will help them gain future victories in the arena. A procedure for randomly generating experienced gladiator characters is also described.

Glider-Pit Gladiators was originally designed (under a deadline of a month or two) for the online 1998 Microgame Design Contest held via the Yahoo Groups Microgame Mailing List. The game was updated under the name Glider-Pit Gladiators 2002 for the second micro-game design competition. The 2002 update focused on cleaning up the rules and making improvements to the spartan components. The experimental Campaign Expansion Rules were developed to provide added depth, and they were also updated in 2002.

The game is a platform on which players can put piles of square stones. The sensors on the platform will help the computer to take track of the moves.
Two different games are included in this early electronic device. In the first (like 3d tic-tac-toe), players have to put 4 stones in a row; the computer will keep track of the moves and tell the players if some of them won. In the second (the labyrinth), players have to find the hidden pattern generated by the computer by creating a tri-dimensional path.

 In ancient times the wise Mother Earth gave birth to the Tribe of Tribes, whose destiny was to dominate the world. This lit the fierce anger of the Big Shadow, that made the world fall into the prison of the eternal alternation between light and darkness, and destroyed the Tribe. But the shaman escaped the vindicative rage and painted on a sacred and inviolable rock, with few primitive signs, the secret to win the dark power of the Big Shadow.
Many and many ages are passed since then. Six glorious Predestined tribes, heirs of the ancient Tribe, decide to face the challenge with the Big Shadow. Their names: Tralon, Orgos, Ab-Diar, Naum, Zark, Groden.
Now, you are the chiefs of those tribes. You have to reach the sacred rock, find the Ancient Sequence, transmit it to your Shaman and defeat the Big Shadow, with great honor. But the path for the sacred rock is long and dangerous. Right outside the village you'll wet yourselves in the Circle of the River of Life, where you can get the gifts of the Language, but you'll have to fight the Salamanders and the Rages, moved by the Big Shadow, to be able to get to the successive Circle, the Land of Chaos. Here you'll be lit with the ancestral frenzy, you'll fight with spears and hatchets the chiefs of the other tribes. Only if you were brave you'll be able to go to the Circle of the Initiation Sea, where you'll learn how to communicate with other tribes. With this you'll finally have completed your Table of the Language and you'll be able to enter the Final Circle: the Knowledge. Here, if you won't get burned by the fire of knowledge, you will be able to read the Ancient Sequence, go back to your village, say the remembered formula and, if it correct, win the game.
But warning: the Big Shadow will try every path to stop you or even win the challenge by covering the whole Circle of Knowledge with its dark presence.

As you have read the game is divided in several parts, each of which has a different objective, that, when reached, will allow players to go to the next part. One of the player is the Big Shadow, and plays against all the others.
Pretty nice but very long game with few standard mechanics and well made components.

6991,Wort Genie,1993,5.5625,8,2.5,2,2,45,45,,Deduction Word Game ,,"In Wort Genie, two players (or two teams) compete to find the secret words of the opponent first. There are about 100 cards, each with 6 words on it, one placed vertically, the others horizontally (crossword-like). The players each take one card secretly. On their turn, they can ask the opponent for a letter. As answer they get all occurrences of this letter in a coordinate system, just like the one of Battleship. Then the next player can ask a letter. If they think, they know some words, they can guess them before asking for a letter. If correct, they can guess another word, until they are wrong or decide to ask for a letter. To help the players, all words on one card are related to the same theme. The first player to find all words on the opponent's card gets as many points, as the difference to the number of correct words the opponent has found out is, e.g. if the looser has found four words, the winner gets two points. Play proceeds until one player has ten points.

The English version of the game is called Battle Words. It was published by William Maclean's Games.

In the middle of the board is a circle of 12 fields, where five different colored crocodiles are placed (belonging to no-one). There is also a deck of cards showing a number in the color of a crocodile. In their turn, a player reveals a card from this deck and sees if they can pull the corresponding crocodile the number of fields indicated by the card in clockwise order. This is possible, if the landing field is empty. After success, the player can decide to reveal another card and do the same. They can also decide to stop and move their pawn one field for every crocodile card which was revealed. But if it is not possible to move the crocodile, the player has to stop and give all cards already revealed to the next player. This player must reveal at least one card (if successful, they can move their pawn for all cards!). If a player in last place moves their pawn, they can double the value; a player in first place must move back, if they are not successful.

Some special action cards can also be used; they allow a player to stop only after an even number of cards revealed or force them to move back, etc.

The game is in German, but all components except the rules are language independent.

Hints are included on the instruction sheet about how to concentrate and utilize your telepathic powers.

This game is extremely fast. It is felt that it reflects the flow of sword vs. sword combat. The players will soon learn that there is more to the game than attack first. Much can be gained by waiting and counterattacking.

The game portrays a sword duel between two Samurai swordsmen during Japan's Feudal era. The object is to be the first to make a successful attack.

Both players secretly select simultaneous moves (there are 48 different moves including various blocks, cuts, stances, thrusts, etc., with optional rules allowing for feints.) The game is played on two large charts with a series of boxes representing each of the 48 moves a swordsman may make. Each box on the chart shows a player's current move and lists the permissible follow-up moves that may be selected in the next phase. These boxes also display the hit probability for the various attacks. This probability varies based upon the type of attack and the defender's move.

They routinely ignored pretty much everything having to do with astronomy, physics, and mathematics, and since my background is technical I found that hard to swallow. The main problem with just about every science fiction game I ran across was too much fiction and not enough science. We put a lot of hard science into the system's design, simplified as much as possible to be playable, to try to put some of the science back in, rather than having it just fiction.

Each player attempts to control a single tribe, to ensure the survival of his tribe, and to boost it along the road to civilization. Towards this end, players work to control the normally random movements of their tribes across a hexagon grid representing a typical area of the pre-historic world, so as to avoid or destroy hostile tribes, contact friendly tribes, and gather as much food as possible.

The success or failure of previous actions influences a tribe's willingness to obey a leader's orders. Tribes may be ordered, among other things, to go on the warpath against other tribes, to strip the immediate area bare of food, or to conduct mystic rituals, which may have dire results. A unique aspect of this simulation is that, theoretically, a player may win by ordering nothing at all. Of course, victory is more likely if the leader seizes control of the tribe and leads it boldly into the future... or perhaps into a tar pit.

The following comes from an advertisement for the game in The Dragon #42:

COULD YOU LIVE WITHOUT METAL, POTTERY, FARMING OR FIRE?

Well, Java Man could ... sometimes. Java Man is the colloquial term for Homo Erectus, the earliest of our ancestors to deserve the title 'man.' Remains of Java Man were first discovered in Java, where the species did not, survive, and later in Africa, where it did, although no one really knows why.

Now, Java Man is a challenging simulation game for one or more players. As leader of a tribe of Java Men, can you gather enough food to keep the tribe alive? Can you conjure up good medicine to make the tribe grow? Can you avoid natural disasters and the depredations of other hungry tribes? And, if the answer to all these questions is 'yes,' can you persuade the tribe to let you try? Find out now; play Java Man.

Java Man features die-cut counters, four-color map, rules booklet and player record sheets packaged in a rugged, 4-mil zip-lock bag. Send check or money order for $5.00 per copy, or ask your local retailer for Java Man.

From the rulebook: The game is designed to recreate, as close as possible, the 'feel' and 'flavor' of infantry combat and the problems and decisions faced by the small unit leader . . . The combat units involved represent the average organizations of the U.S., Germany, and the U.S.S.R. The playing area represents typical European buildings and streets. All names on the maps are in German, but represent typical small town architecture and street plans left over from the Middle Ages . . . Proceed with caution: the town is unfriendly, the enemy is experienced and your men aren't expendable. You have your mission and your organization. As soon as you read the rules and set-up, it will be H-HOUR.

From designer's William A. Comito's comments in the rulebook: A game is one man's view of a particular subject, and is only as good as the author's research and experience. I designed this game from the viewpoint of a professional soldier who has spent 6+ years in the infantry, including two combat tours, and who has been an instructor in small unit tactics and map reading. My training has been in all aspects of infantry combat, and my research has included not only books but interviews with combat infantry veterans of WWII . . . The game is, honestly, an attempt to combine a miniatures game and a boardgame together. Most of the rules are written from a boardgame viewpoint, but can be readily applied to miniatures.

The object is to accumulate as much wealth as possible through the buying and selling of commodity contracts. Players trade in seven commodities: two grains (corn and wheat), two meats (cattle and hogs), one industrial metal (copper), one money instrument (T-Bills), and one precious metal (gold).

LIMIT UP makes you part of the commodity world. You can speculate on the expected price movement, protect your crop, balance your portfolio and limit your risk, or use high leverage. You compete with government policy, weather, and other market forces.
No commodity trade would be complete without an inside track; someone always seems to know more than others. In LIMIT UP, you know who is the insider, and you can watch that trader adjust his or her portfolio to profit from the news.

You also have the option of just buying the cheap stock and letting someone else rebuild for you. One of the unique features of the game is that you will not know who is the winner until the very last piece is played. After all, a critically placed Slum can make the difference between thousands and millions of dollars.

Game play mainly falls into three parts. The first half hour is pretty much an all out war to build up as many companies as possible and collect stock. In the middle portion of the game, players hold onto their stock waiting for opportunities to build key buildings in order to tip the tide of the game in their favor. The last portion of the game is a fast paced, white knuckled race to either destroying the biggest company on the board or playing the last piece to end the game.

7074,Don: Continuing Criminal Enterprise,2002,4.33333,3,0,2,2,10,10,Customizable,Card Game Collectible Components Mafia ,,"DON: CCE is a new collectible card game that allows two players to assume the roles of the head of a Criminal Organization vying for control of a major city. The Player Don uses a wide variety of Associates and Family Members to attempt to bankrupt his opponent. In addition to henchmen, a Don may play actions directly from his hand to affect either his own Associates or his opponents. The Don who bankrupts his opponents funds is the winner.

DON: CCE is set in a timeless world of crime, containing elements from the Prohibition era through the rise of the modern mob. This fantasy world of the Mafia is simulated to allow players to battle each other in a spirit reflective of classic Gangster movies.

Player Dons use their tradable cards to generate funds, control vices and even whack their opponents Associates. Game rules are provided to play Sealed Deck, Double Sealed Deck and Constructed decks for use in tournament play, multiple player, and direct head to head competition. The Capo starter deck is available now.  The Capo booster packs, available in Summer 2003, will add a wealth of characters, actions, and possibilities to any game of DON: CCE. The complete card set at present contains over 200 separate cards representing everything from a lowly Babbo Crew to the powerful Made Men and the infamous Penitent Wife.  The artwork is highly stylized to represent the classic gangster photos of yesteryear with hints of contemporary crime.

Using a revolutionary new game system, Dons are able to control cards in ways that other card games have never imagined. Each players actions control how many cards he wishes to deploy as well as how many funds he chooses to spend.  In DON: CCE, each Don controls his fate through strategy, not luck.

Future expansions will add even more stylized elements of the genre, including more Law Enforcement, additional Associates, more Family members, and even more Vices for Dons to expand their businesses.

It requires tax players who are willing to take a chance with a Tax Shelter that may give financial security or may backfire. After four tours around the Board, the Tax player who has the most after-tax cash wins the game and has successfully been able to STICK THE IRS. The players move around the colorful board, landing on opportunities to earn income, spend money on non-deductible expenses and to purchase a variety of tax shelters. In addition, the players have a chance to receive annual reports that determine whether the tax shelter investment made them rich or, as in most real life shelters, turn out to be a bust. Finally, an exposure to the horrors and humor of audit lurks with every roll of the dice. Drilling for oil in Hawaii, establishing a baseball team in Alaska, reviving an old motion picture, and building ski condominiums in Texas are just a few of the fun and exciting tax shelter opportunities that the player is offered in STICK THE IRS. Although humorous and in good taste, the game also offers certain educational benefits in highlighting the good and the bad in the use of shelters to reduce taxes. The player who manages to best use his income, his CPA and his shelters, and therefore who manages to pay the least tax, is the winner, having successfully been able to STICK THE IRS.

7122,Sail Away,1962,6.125,4,0,2,6,90,90,,Nautical Racing Sports ,Point to Point Movement,"A game of yacht racing, and an interesting precursor to 3M's Regatta. Sail Away was possibly designed by Howard J. Mullin as he is listed as the copyright holder on the game board.

Sail Away is played on a board resembling a nautical chart overlaid by a square grid. The game includes six metal yachts numbered 1 through 6. The yachts lean to one side or the other according to their tack. The yachts are moved across the map using the intersections of the grid lines.

Movement is governed by a spinner which has an inner and outer circle of results - one circle for the upwind leg, and the other circle for the downwind and crosswind legs. In addition to the bit of luck injected by the spinner (reflecting the vagaries of the wind), there is also a slight chance for misfortune - two small spaces on the spinner allow for a player to lose a turn for having a man overboard and two turns for capsizing. The rules also cover blanketing effects by windward yachts toward leeward yachts, tacking, and jibing.

The course is somewhat fixed in that the wind direction is always the same (southeast) and there are three course markers designated on the map. However, there are four different courses that may be run: counterclockwise around the triangular course described by the three markers, clockwise around the triangular course, around course marker 2 and back, or around course marker 3 and back. In addition, players may choose to race one lap or multiple laps.

Pilot-players pit themselves against each other and other flying odds as they strive to stay in the lead.

7127,Windshifts,1980,8.5,1,0,2,4,60,60,,Nautical Racing Sports ,Modular Board,"Dubbed A Tactical Sailing Game, Windshifts uses a novel game system combined with unusual components to recreate international yacht racing.

The board is randomly created as the race develops using 19 plastic map cards that lock together. The race is in three segments; a windward leg, a downwind leg, and then another windward leg to the finish line. As portions of the race are completed, the map cards from that segment are returned to the draw pile to be reused later in the game.

There are no spaces on the board. The direction and strength of the wind are indicated by lines on the plastic map cards. The distance a ship moves is determined by the wind strength and the ship's bearing in relation to the wind direction.

The ships have clear plastic bases with a numbered wheel mounted in the center. The ships' bases have lines molded into them that are aligned with the lines on the map cards to establish the bearing of a ship. As the ship is moved across the map, the wheel in the center turns, and each number on the wheel indicates one unit of movement.  On a map card with strong wind indicated a ship bearing on a beat, broad reach or downwind moves 4 units or one complete revolution of the wheel.  A beam reach bearing generates 6 units of movement.  On a map card with light wind indicated, the movements are half.

A plastic windshadow card is used to determine when an opposing boat is in disturbed air - this differs based on whether the boats are on the downwind or windward (upwind) leg.  The sail of a ship will cause the air downwind (behind) of it to move in weak chaotic swirl patterns, the sail effectively blocks the wind from supplying power to any other boat following downwind  within about 1 1/2 boat lengths.  In the game, the windshadow card is used to determine if one boat has blocked the wind from powering another boat.  If this is the case, the movement of the blocked boat is reduced.

VCR Baseball is the exciting baseball strategy game that can turn an ordinary afternoon into a thrilling day at the ballpark.  Become an actual player and see the outcome of your hits on TV as you watch the video tape containing footage of professional slugging action.  Home runs, double plays, triples, fielding errors, pop-ups...it's all there for you to see and experience!

The basic game is quickly learned and fast playing.  Each time you pitch or bat you choose a baseball strategy.  Make your decision just as in real baseball -- depending on what kind of hit you want to get, how many outs there are, and if there are runners on the base.  Then compare your choice with your opponent's and find out what happens.  You could strike out, get a walk, or a hit.  If it's a hit -- you watch the videotape to see the outcome!

And VCR Baseball is actually two strategy games in one.  The advanced game adds more baseball depth.  Your team players have their own batting and pitching abilities, so you can bring in a right-handed pinch hitter to try for a crucial hit off a lefty pitcher.  Or relieve a tiring pitcher.  Intentionally walk an excellent hitter, bunt or steal a base.

Features:
- 2 games in one!
- unlimited replayability
- for 2 players
- live footage of professional ball players in action
- fun for ages 12 to adult

Components:
- approx. 30-minute video tape
- colorful game board
- 6 playing pieces
- batting and pitching cards
- playing grids
- score pad

There was a comic book about the characters used in the game, a group of five kids who each had the ability to turn into a different animal.

The game is cooperative.  The kids have been placed on the planet TerraTopia and have to each find their colored stone before the planet's three moons meet (or something along those lines).  The players can choose to travel around the board together or separately.

The game was designed by Peter Olotka, one of the Eon Products team, and his son Greg.  The game definitely shows some of the Eon originality in the mechanics.  The players have to recover their stones by overcoming challenges at various locations on the board.  There are a large number of possible challenges, generated by randomly placing generic challenge markers (e.g., Fog) at the various locations and having a booklet which describes exactly what Fog means at each location.  The players have to be able to explain to each other how they would use their character's powers (shape-changing and normal talents) to overcome the challenges.

For some obscure reason, the game is limited to four players - maybe because they ran out of cool colors, as they used black, white, gold and silver.

The basic idea is each player has his or her own map of the area (in this case the South Pacific) behind a screen. Each player searches for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the hex and calling the hex number. Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet. The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on hexes and the attacking planes are placed in hexes to indicate which ship it is attacking.

The basic game is very simple. But there are many additional rules, which add realism (and complexity): CAP fighters, surface actions, bases, inaccurate search reports, etc.

The game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.

Close Quarters Combat Board Game

Victor or vanquished. Which will you be?

Since the dawn of civilization, mysterious forces have plucked the ancient armies from their savage battlefields, and placed them on the Battle Grid of eternity. Caught in a maelstrom of space and time, they fight countless battles with the enemies from many famous conflicts: The Hundred Years War, French Revolution, American Revolution, Civil War, World War I and others. Surviving armies savor victory, while the defeated rise again to oppose them. There are battles to be won. Are you ready for more?

Battle Grid uses the Skirmish Combat System to resolve close quarters battle. Each player controls a squad of soldiers on the battlefield. All troop commands are resolved by dice rolls, with the special abilities of each army playing an important strategic role in the conflict.

Object of the Game: Eliminate all of your opponent's soldiers in close quarters, skirmish combat.

On the way there, everyone is lost who misses the connection to the caravan. In the end, quite a few desert foxes lose their orientation, since their senses are confused by mirages.

Movement is made by choosing one of three visible cards, which range from forward 1-4, backward 1-4 and a few special cards. While moving spaces already occupied by another camel aren't counted, so staying together with the caravan (at least for some time) is quite useful.

The game starts with the maximal element (with four sides) already placed in the center of the game field. Every next element, can be put on the field, only where the side of the current element can touch the side of an existing element.
If the side of just-placed element touches the game field border, the set of the connected elements scrolls in the opposite direction, or directions, if the element touches two borders. When this scrolling occurs, extra elements are deleted from the element set (they fall).
The player randomly choose the element which must be placed, and the element which will be the next. In computer realization, these elements are randomly generated by the machine.
Every successfully placed element is counted.

7245,Blacks & Whites,1970,4.83571,14,2,3,9,120,90,,Economic Educational Negotiation ,Auction/BiddingRoll / Spin and MoveSimulationStock HoldingTrading,"Originally published as a free game insert (with paper board and unmounted cards that had to be cut out) in the March 1970 issue of Psychology Today magazine (which simultaneously advertised a version in a long cardboard box, with better components and play money, for $5.95), Blacks  Whites was a socially-conscious game which not only reflected the signs of the times but was also meant to effect change. In a sense, it was something more akin to a social experiment and performance art in game form. On the bottom side of its box, the game description reads: Experience the ghetto. Live on Welfare. Try to buy a place in a white suburb. Your challenge: To keep the land-hungry majority type from winning the game cheaply and quickly.... If Black players turn the tide against white advantages, a kind of irrepressible excitement takes over the board.

Players were divided into Whites and Blacks and had to make economic progress while competing with each other. Based on Monopoly, the idea was to demonstrate how the odds were stacked against black people in society by having different rules for each race in the game. The difference between this and all the other roll-and-move go-around-the board-buying-property games is that before the game, each player assumes the role of either a Black or White person.

Whites start out as the majority with $1,000,000.00 to spend and are able to buy property anywhere. Blacks start out as the minority with only $10,000.00 to spend; are unable to buy certain properties; have to draw from a separate Chance deck; are banned from purchasing property in the 'Surburban Zone'; and collect less money for completing a lap around the gameboard. Blacks are limited to certain areas of the board until they had accumulated at least $100,000.00. Players are encouraged to change the rules when anyone lands on the People's Park space.

Needless to say, it turned out to be one of the most controversial board games of all time and even merited an article in Time magazine: The game, produced by Psychology Today Games (an off shoot of the magazine) now on sale ($5.95) at major department stores, was developed at the University of California at Davis by Psychology Department Chairman Robert Sommer. It was conceived as a painless way for middle-class whites to experience  and understand  the frustrations of blacks. In Sommers version, however, the black player could not win; as a simulation of frustration, the game was too successful. Then David Popoff, a Psychology Today editor, redesigned the game, taking suggestions from militant black members of 'US' in San Diego. The new rules give black players an opportunity to use  and even to beat  the System.

Although turning Monopoly into an attempt to draw peoples attention to social issues seems a little bit of a long shot, its worth noting that the original version of 'Monopoly' itself, called The Landlords Game, was designed to demonstrate how the current economic system led to inequality and bankruptcy.

Psychology Todays board game division seems to have been short-lived but other titles included 'The Cities Game' involving urban tension, corruption and the undercurrents of city politics'; and 'Woman and Man' where Each woman must accumulate enough Status Quo points (100) to prove her equality to Men. Each man must collect enough Status Quo points (100) to prove once and for all a Womans place is beneath his.

7257,Tall Stories,1980,6,2,0,2,10,30,30,,Bluffing Humor ,Storytelling,"Tall Stories involves rolling two dice and moving a counter (shared by all players) around a board according to the result. The board spaces all describe themes. One die is red, the other is white. A card is drawn and the red and white dice specify two words on that card. A one minute timer is turned and you have that long to tell a story covering the theme you landed on and incorporating the two words you rolled.

It is the job of other players to identify which two words you rolled. The words of course bear no particular relevance to the theme and hiding them on the spot involves the creation of the most colorfully chaotic tales with impromptu decoy words thrown in as fast as possible.

The system of reward has gone lost to me, as have the rules, and I'm unsure of how points are scored, except to say that there is a 1-10 scoring bar in the game. How it is used I don't know.

The premise is simple.  Players (2-6) assume the role of carefree Hitchikers and set out on the road to make their fortune while trying to avoid trouble along the way.  Hitchikers don't have jobs so you'll have to find some more creative ways to make your money.

Each player begins with a HOMETOWN, $25,000 and a Bank envelope.  The object of the game is to be the first player to save $250,000 in your Bank or accumulate $50 million in traveling cash.  You can only deposit money in your bank by passing through or landing on your own HOMETOWN.

The mechanics of the game (play method) will be familiar to anyone who has played a traditional board game like Monopoly except unlike most other games, you're never really out of it until someone actually wins.

Hitchikers travel by rolling two dice and following the highway clockwise around the board.  Each city or location along the road counts as one space.  Upon arrival at your new location, you will either be presented with an opportunity to earn huge sums of money or face a potential disaster like a Bad Ride or worse.

Although random luck (dice) will play a role during the game, there is also a need for strategic planning.  With two ways to win the game delivers an opportunity for everyone to have a chance.  If you tend to be cautious by nature, you can win by being conservative and saving money in your Bank.  On the other hand, if you like to gamble you will love the pursuit of monster payouts as you stack up your traveling cash.

Fast paced, high stakes action.

Developed and tested for several years by leading aviation experts, Flight Simulator answers the need for more realistic ground training by simulating the psychological atmosphere of actual in-flight conditions.

As each pilot flies his cross-country flight, situations are programmed that test his flying abilities. By reference to components of the Flight Simulator, incorrect responses are immediately observed, analyzed, and explained. Greater insight generally results from group discussion of the particular situation.

Each pilot selects a flight course according to his proficiency level. When the Flight Simulator is used by more than one pilot, it becomes a competitive cross-country race. The more experienced airmen are handicapped by flying programmed courses demanding greater skills, and the point score is given consistent with the appropriate knowledge. A student pilot can compete with the private or commercial pilot, while all are fully challenged by the situations encountered.

The Southwestern area of the United States has been chosen as Flight Simulator country in answer to the Simulator's need for the greatest variety of flying terrain. The map-board is WAC scale, 1 inch=1,000,000 inches.

... Up to 3 times/game, a player may force everyone to trade 1-3 pieces to left/right/across (no 'across' in a 3er, of course!)

Almost everyone, at one time or another, has wanted to be a farmer; to be able to look back from a tractor seat over a completely plowed field at the end of the day and feel a sense of accomplishment as the smell of newly turned earth slowly surrounds you.

RICH FARMER, POOR FARMER, the only farm game on the market, puts you in the tractor seat, gives you $25,000 to start farming, and youre on your way to an adventurous education of the problems and realities of farming.  It may not give you the smell of freshly plowed ground or the self-satisfaction of a hard days work, but it will wake you up to the fact that farming is much more than just plowing and planting.  Youll experience the responsibility of farm ownership and development, and with luck, reap the benefits of successful farm management.

RICH FARMER, POOR FARMER was invented by a 28-year old Alabama farmer, Donald McDonald, as a means of educating the public to the realities of farming.

The game was first introduced in October, 1978, at the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition.  With the news coverage of tractorcades and the farmers dilemma over the past year, the games popularity has steadily gained momentum.  It continues to receive widespread exposure in farm magazines, newspapers and television.  As a result, the game has been mailed all over the United States.

The object of the game is to survive financially  just as in real life.  In the game, an actual farmer has no advantage over a city slicker who thinks a bush hog is a type of pig.  Players can end up a Rich Farmer or a Poor Farmer, depending on how well they manage their money.

An entertaining and educational game about farming for 2 to 6 players.

This is a simple combat game in which players attempt to capture all six of their opponent's commandos. Players roll a die to determine how many spaces they may move any combination of commandos.  If a commando ends their move adjacent to an opposing figure, combat takes place:  each player rolls a die, and the higher roll captures the opposing piece.  Once per game, captured commandos may be freed by moving onto a compound gate space.  There are also resource tiles on the map that can be picked up and later used to temporarily boost your team's abilities.

The real attraction of the game comes into play when a player rolls the missile launcher symbol on the die. The player then uses a battery-operated gun to fire one or two foam discs at the board. If a piece is knocked over, it is captured, even it happened to be your own commando.

When all answers are in, the team compares notes and computes the average of their two answers. The correct answer is then revealed, and the team whose average is the closest wins the round and $100. The first team to reach $1,000 wins.

NBC/Hasbro's bookshelf line included several game show-esque board games including The Mating Game, Rhyme Time, Trivia, Chain Letters, and It Takes Two.

For example, the first question under The Real Me is I keep records of my expenditures; a)Yes, b)No, c)Sometimes. There are a, b and c columns on each card. Players use special hole punches to punch out the column corresponding to their answer.

When all players have punched their answers the cards are placed in pairs in the reader and the number of common answers are noted by checking to see where the punched holes overlap. The players with the most overlaps are considered to be the most compatible.

Tano: the Game 
 Moving the Wooden Spheres
Made by Davans for two players 8 years to adult.

Make lines of 3, 4, 5, or 6 spheres to capture unplayed spheres from your opponents reserve pile, but make sure that no line contains more than one sphere of the same color. Once captured, turn the opposing spheres over to make them allies.

The Tano Legend
Before time memorial, the legendary Tano peoples who inhabited the Caribbean island of Borikn played an abundance of board games, most of them now time forgotten. Some of these games they played not as a form of entertainment, but rather as a means to more useful ends. quot;Moving the Wooden Spheresquot; was one of the games that were played in special occasions, and then only by the cacikes (chiefs) of the tribes. The game was played when it became necessary to settle a dispute between two tribes. It was then that two peaceful minds would engage in a battle of witsfor it was sacrilege for Tanos to wage war amongst themselves; although, they were fearless fighters when their small island had to be defended; as it happened quite often when the bloodthirsty Caribes came charging across the sea from their strongholds in the Orinoco Delta in what is now Venezuela. They raided the island repeatedly looking to slay the Tano warriors and take their women and children to use as slaves, but the Caribes were always driven back.

To play the game the cacike of each tribe was quot;armedquot; with eighteen wooden spheres, three of each of six types of wood. Each cacike would appoint a warrior to quot;move the spheresquot; as he/she instructed. (The great cacike Yuisa of the Haimanio Yukayeke was probably the first female ruler in America).

The two quot;combatantsquot; would set the spheres at opposite edges of the batey (a plaza, used for tribal ceremoniesand as an immense gameboard when there was a need to quot;move the spheresquot;). The quot;movement of the spheresquot; would begin as the older cacike conceded the honor of moving the first sphere to the younger, less experienced one; thereafter the two appointed warriors would alternate turns moving the spheres as the cacikes instructed into pits (36 in total) dug out of the hard surface of the batey following strict rules of placement.

2. Vector, which is a sum of two existing connected vectors with joint vertex in case :

* is discreet (i.e. lies on two dots from the field);
    * doesn't intersect existing vector;
    * the joint vertex of the vectors, which sum is, is its vertex too;
    * lies in the sub-plane defined by the non-obtuse angle defined by the two vectors, which sum is it;

The scientific part is mainly driven by drawing one or more of  the huge number of event cards - which can be positive or negative (Surprise!!!). But also a bit of negotiating is necessary as you often want to use some scientific machines only another player owns.

Getting in the different commissions requires also some negotiating between the players (Promise everything, but keep nothing..).

The games in this series features a common four (4) page series rulebook and generally a four (4) page game specific rulebook, of which one page is the cover. The games of this series feature simple rules that are a quick study and low counter density. Most games feature step reduction and have substitute counters included in the counter mix.

CAEN 1944 features an 11x17 map and 100 counters. The units are divisions with some brigade/regiments. Several units have step reduction.

From the rules introduction:
After the Allied landings in Normandy in 1944, the main concern of Eisenhower was to expand the bridgehead and bring in supplies and new units. Ike thought Montgomery should have made more rapid progress in his attacks on Caen. One thing slowing down the British and Canadians was the preponderant numbers of SS and regular Panzer divisions facing the British along the Caen position.

Turning slow progress into a partial tactical victory, Montgomery held down this large German armoured strength while the Americans broke out on the other flank and cut off a large number of German troops in what became known as the Falaise Pocket. In this game the Allied objective is to accomplish what Montgomery did only much sooner. The Axis objective is to stop the Allies in their tracks and destroy Montgomery's army group.

From the design notes:
Caen is truly siege warfare with Panzer and armoured divisions leading the siege. The massive number of German Panzer and SS divisions employed at Caen were able to stop Monty cold for weeks.

This game uses a very complex sequence of play to bring in all the elements of the campaign.

In general, the SS was usually better equipped and stronger than a comparable Whermacht(sic) unit. Some SS units in this game are weaker than one would expect, this was due to the immense difficulty in reaching the front intact and because of Allied air harassment or they were being rebuilt when thrown into the campaign.

Caen helped the Allies tie the Germans down, but it would have been an even bigger victory for them if Monty had reached Falaise sooner. Now it's your turn to try or try to stop him. 

By todays games standards the complex sequence of play referred to in the design notes is a very relaxing stroll in the park.

Turns are alternated like that until one of the two player groups have 9 bananas!!

Chimps roll the die and move.If they land on an empty space they must place a banana at that space from the central warehouse.BUT if there is a banana at the space they land they can pick it up and put it on their private stash!!
If a chimp lands on a space where anothe chimp stand he gets another turn!!
Chimps can also rescue their fellow chimps that a hiding in a tree!If he passes over or land in a space where a chimp is hiding on a tree the chimp on the tree can climb back down safely.
Finally if a chimp lands on the space that George occupies he gives him a slap stunning him for a turn.
On the other hand George has the ability to pick up bananas from every space he land and has one but he is not obliged to put some on an empty space.
If George lands or passes a space that is occupied by a chimpanzee he chases him up the tree.If all the chimps are in the trees then in order to come down they must soothe him by giving him a banana each from their personal stack and not the warehouse unless they have none.If George is on the space when the Chimp comes down from the tree, George gets another turn.

7441,Brainwaves,1977,6.35,10,1,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Electronic ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Brainwaves a two-player abstract, fairly simple in concept.

Basically, it's a grid, and you've got 3 pieces on your side, and the other guy's got three pieces on his side.  To win, you have to move two of your pieces onto the other side.  Your pieces are all the same shape, in red, yellow, and green.  You roll a die, and then get to move one of your pieces that number.

The gimmick is this: before moving your piece, you choose which one you want to move, and then turn a hidden dial to that color.  Your opponent then turns his hidden dial to the color he THINKS you're going to choose (or the color he wants to stop you from choosing).

After both players have set their dials, a button is pressed, and the colors light up, revealing the choices.  If he guessed right, you don't get to move.  Otherwise you do move, and then the turn alternates - your opponent rolls and you have to guess.

There are passages on the board that can be blocked strategically, and you can't pass another token - but if you land on it exactly, you send it back home

There's a lot of double- and triple- thinking (he thinks I'm going to do that, but instead I'll do this.  But what if he realizes that I know he thinks I'm going to do this...) to it, and it has a built-in balancing mechanism - when a player has gotten one piece in, he then only has two to choose from, which increases the chance of his opponent stopping him.

Most games take around 30 minutes, but with a lot of good guessing, the game could, in theory, go on forever.  I've seen one game take almost an hour-and-a-half!

7450,Stop-Gate,1976,6.74375,8,0,2,2,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Line DrawingPaper-and-PencilTile Placement,"Stop-Gate is a two-player game of perfect information. It can be played on a board or as a paper and pencil game.  As a board game, the game uses a checkerboard and a set of dominoes.  As pencil and paper game, players can take turns coloring in squares on a grid (there is no capturing or movement, so there is no need to erase anything during the game).

Stop-Gate is taken from the book On Numbers and Games by John Conway (Academic Press, 1976) and is attributed to Goran Andersson on page 74. In the book Conway doesn't really give the game any name.

It appears in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, where it is called Domineering, or Crosscram. There it says that [t]his game has been considered by Goran Andersson, so it is not clear if the designer credit given here is accurate.

Stop-Gate is played with the standard winning condition for combinatorial games, which is that the player who makes the last legal move wins. A legal move consists of placing a domino on two unoccupied spaces on the board (or coloring in two adjacent squares). One player can only place dominoes horizontally, and the other can only place vertically. Typically, the game decomposes into smaller open regions, which may be of benefit to one player or the other.

An impartial variant exists where neither player has a restriction on the orientation of their dominoes. This is also called Cram.

Players have a hand of nine cards, draw a tenth, and then play one of their cards either on their movement pile, their pyramid, or an opponent's movement pile.

There are three types of cards, movement cards, pyramid cards, and a few special cards. The movement cards show one or more diagonal directions on the pyramid the player's Q*bert may travel on future turns.  Once a movement direction has been chosen on a previous turn, players may add cards to build a pyramid one card per turn. Players may also play movement cards on their opponent's movement pile to send that player's Q*bert in a less productive direction, or waste another turn to change direction again.  There are also special cards which stop your opponents movement, or put Coily, Q*bert's purple snake nemesis, around an opponent's pyramid.  There are also helpful cards that either move a Q*bert to the top of the pyramid, or to allow free movement on the pyramid.

The finished pyramid is made of staggered horizontal cards.

Players play movement cards to change their direction on the pyramid until one player finishes the completed layout, and scores 100 extra points.  All players total their points on their pyramid and the highest score wins.

It#039;s a game for any number of people, and works equally well face-to-face (tracking energy with pencils or beads or coins, scrawling powers onto cards and handing them out) as through the Internet (via any real-time conversation thing).

You place the marble in front of a knob on a spring.  You pull back the knob and when you let it go the marble flies up a slight incline on your track and then rolls back down on one of the four lanes on the other side of the track.  The marble will push one of your plastic cars towards the finish line.  Depending on how far you pull back on the spring determines how fast your marble will shoot as well as which lane it will land in.  You grab your marble and send it up the track again.  Both players play as fast as they can simultaneously to win.

Components are two black marbles and 8 plastic cars (4 each of two colors: yellow, green or blue, depending on the edition).

Players take the roles of one of the major political parties (from communists down to the Nazis), trying to win elections and have their politicians in the government. Laws are made in a roleplaying style,  which change the rules of the game and influence the economics and life in Germany, while there are still reparations to be paid, and inflation threatens the economic stability.
Some parties have military and paramilitary troops which can be used to break other parties` rallies or to suppress public uprisings.

You are one of these mad drivers. Only the first place counts, and no holds are barred.

The print-yourself components include 10 two-sided race track segments, six player cars and control panels (with tokens for shift gear and engine temperature), a 54 card deck (of additional car equipment) and armour, tires, brakes and turbo tokens. Five dice are also needed.

On your turn, you can speed up, slow down or change gears. This is cleverly handled by the control panel, where speed is vertical and gears horizontal - but not all grid points are connected. You can only go so fast in first gear! The gear diagram is also colour-coded to indicate how bad the engine heat test is. In addition, you may spend brake or turbo tokens (to slow down or speed up further).

You manoeuvre your car from lane to lane - but this depends on speed and your driving skill test. The faster you go, the less you can switch lanes. Tire tokens are spent for extra lane changes. If you ram an obstacle or another player, armour tokens are spent. Other cars could end up being pushed. A favourite technique is the Rush N' Crush, where you speed up right behind your opponent so as to crush him forcefully.

A cheap Hollywood remake of two classic 8x8 board games, Checkers and Reversi.  If you really did try stretching your checkers board and it ripped ... sorry about that.

Hexversi requires 91 penny-sized pieces that are differently colored on each side.  Hexchex requires 12 standard checkers for each player.

But, obviously, your previous allies will use the breathing space to re-arm, ally themselves with the enemy and invade us!  As the President, it is your sacred duty to beat the other countries to the punch.  The time for decisive action is now!

Each player has his own little country map, divided into conceptual areas: political, military, communications, production and population.  Each player also has a production card, 60 people tokens, 6 Action cards, 3 ships, 2 carriers and 1 airplane.  The players share 30 missile markers (power 5, 15 or 30) and 15 Goal cards.

The Goal cards represent your secret victory conditions (see below).  People will eventually spread not only over your own areas but the other players' --giving you a say in each player's destiny as will be seen below.

Play is in rounds, with each round beginning with a Player Order and Political phase, and then a varying number of player turns.

Player Order phase: The order of play is determined by each player's Communications area.  Each player counts his people in that area, and each other player with people in that area either adds, subtracts or stays neutral (his choice).  Largest score goes first during the round and so on.

Political phase: Place up to four of your six Action cards (keeping at least one), face down, in front of the other players, in any ratio.  This phase is resolved in sequence by all players.  Next come the individual player turns.

Production phase: Each player's production card is progressively filled up with people markers; the level reached indicates what can be produced.  Producing anything, even something way below the current fill line, empties the card (the people go back to the player's Production area).

Embarkation phase: People of your colour (up to 10) may be embarked on one of your ships.  Missiles (up to 30 total power) of a controlled colour may be embarked on a carrier or airplane of a controlled colour which happens to be off the missile's shores.

Action phase: The player must play one of his Action cards (the ones he kept earlier plus those played on him).  Political clout (people in your Political area) can be used to instead lay a card aside for a later round.

These player turns continue until all players pass.  The players then recover their Action cards from the discard pile.  Cards laid aside during the round are put back in the player's hand --so you may end up with a smaller or larger hand than usual.  A player without any people in his Population area, or with less than 5 total people markers on his country (diasporas don't count!) is eliminated.

Goal cards indicate either a player to eliminate (you win even if another player is responsible for your target's elimination) or two players to dominate politically or demographically.

The Action cards are:

Transfer - Transfer up to 5 people of your colour from one area to another, within your country.

Disembark - Up to 5 embarked people on one of your ships off another country's shores disembarks into any area.

Growth - For each 5 people of one colour in your Population area, add two more.  Enemies also grow if present.

Production - Move up to 5 people from your Production area into the production display.  They may be of another colour if their owner agrees.

Move - You can move one ship of your colour, or one carrier or airplane of a colour you control by one country.  Ships and carriers move clockwise or counter-clockwise, airplanes move anywhere.

Shoot - Fire a missile on board a carrier or airplane of a colour you control onto an area of the country where it currently is.  The missile kills as many people as its power.  The more powerful missiles can spill their effect over into other areas of the target country.  Casualties must be fairly spread between the colours present in the area (if it matters).

Cornelius Sulla -- all leading to the brutal dictatorship of Sulla. The outside threats led quickly to the establishment of the army as a political power base; the day of the military dictator was at hand, and the Republic was entering its death throes.

The Diadochoi refined and reformed the Macedonian system of warfare perfected by Alexander the Great. There were, however, two major factors that made their tactical efforts somewhat less successful. None of them was anywhere near Alexander the Great in their ability either to understand or to utilize tactical systems. And, they loved elephants (to be honest, so did Alexander, but he never had the chance to use them). Thus, while this period is the heyday of the Macedonian art of war (if not exactly its apogee), we find the system becoming overly rigid and ill-served.

It was also the first time the Romans encountered elephants. Although Pyrrhus appears to have won both encounters (there is some disagreement about the end results at Ausculum), the Epirote casualty rate was so high that it led to the formation of the term 'Pyrrhic victory.'

Ultimately, all they succeeded in doing was to rigidly formalize its elements, adding only hordes of elephants, the ultimate expression of which was the massive battle of Ipsus, the largest known elephant battle in history.

Despite the warning on the cover (it says, The Irreverent Strategy Game, right there in big print), you may not be prepared for what's inside.

PerPlexus is a game requiring both quick thinking and a constantly changing strategy.  The play board is a network comprised of 6 sliding play pieces or shuttles that can be moved right or left, offensively or defensively, by either player.  The game objective is to place 5 stones in a row -- horizontally, vertically, or diagonally -- while blocking the opponent's attempts to line up 6 stones in a row.  Each shuttle has spaces for 7 stones.  PerPlexus requires that a player plan moves several turns in advance whether playing stones or moving shuttles.

The four games are:
Space Pirates. 2-4 players. Players control 3 ships and are racing to pick up cargoes from asteroids and return them to earth. Each ship has a speed from 0 to 5 must change speed by one unit each turn. The moon orbits the earth, and is a constant hazard. Attacks are permitted and send the loser out of control. Landing is a fine art of judging speed.

Deadly Planet. 2-4 players. Each player has a team of astronauts stranded on a hostile planet and they have to reach specific pick-up point. Dangerous beasts roam the planet, some of which can be ridden; others exist only to attack astronauts.

Invasion Earth. 2 players. The Ganoids are invading Earth's seas. The earth player using orbital missile satellites, submarine and surface fleets must track down and destroy the Ganoids spawning craft. It is a game of careful placement as the Ganoid player tries to over-extend the Earth player's resources.

Galactic War. 2 players. The Krul vs the Stellar Federation. Players expand across the map capturing planets to increase their technology rating and dodging the randomly moving anti-matter cloud. Combat and conquest depends on the number of ships in the fleet. As only one ship can occupy each space, long snaking fleets stretch across the board. Some of the ships are annihilators - suicide bombers that destroy all neighboring ships. Ship types are kept secret from your opponent.

Cover-Up is a game for the entire family. The idea is for each player to cover up as many squares and gain as many points as possible using the tiles provided for each player. However each tile played must touch another tile and cannot cover a black square.

The game features a square board with 256 squares (16x16) on it. Some of the squares are blacked in, others have a number, while the majority are white and blank.

Each player receives a set of translucent tiles in one color (yellow, blue, green, or red). The tiles vary in size from one space to 2x2 spaces in size.

Players take turns placing tiles on the board in an attempt to cover numbers which increase scoring. Black spaces may not be covered.

7546,Dominator,1993,0,0,0,2,2,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Fighting Science Fiction ,Tile Placement,"A chess-like science fiction themed game. The game board represents the planet Elkos and is broken up into a series of hexes with four different types of terrain: Flatlands, Rough, High plateaus, and bunkers.

There are four different types of pieces corresponding to the four Elkosian races of the planet. The Etons move in a straight line and are blocked by anything but flat terrain. The Artilla Squads also move in a straight line, but may traverse flatlands and rocky terrain. The winged Ariel Bombers may traverse any terrain, but fly short distances - they also carry bombs to bombard the opponents. Finally, the Dominator Lord (one per side) moves up to three hexes but may not ascend plateaus. Its special ability however is to convert any opposing piece to its side by moving next to it.

An interesting twist to the game is that the game board may be altered through the use of bombs. When a bomb is dropped, the owning player may use one of 14 tri-hexes to alter the landscape, thereby making previously impassable terrain passable.

The game ends when either the opposing Dominator Lord is killed, one side no longer has pieces other than the Dominator Lord to move, or a stalemate is reached.

Game components are mostly card stock, three color printing on the board.

Concept

The forces of Tragic Destiny (Tod) and Natural Order (NO) are in opposition.

NO wins if Siegfried marries Brunhild or Kriemhild, which occurs if Siegfried is alone with either queen in a castle (both pieces occupy vertices of the same castle and the third vertex is vacant).

Tod wins if Gunther marries Brunhild, which occurs if Gunther and Siegfried are both in a castle with Brunhild; or if Gunther and Hagen kill Siegfried by the three of them occupying the neighbouring vertices on a triangle, with no vertex being part of a castle.

The victory conditions can be filled at any point in a turn, and the game ends immediately.

Set-up

Put each board piece on the grid point position listed in the Set-up Table under Start.  Each player takes one of each player piece, and puts them behind the screen in front of him.  One player is Tod, the other NO.  Tod chooses 2 of his 5 player pieces and puts them on the table in front of his screen.

Play

Each player secretly chooses 2 of his player pieces, excluding those placed in front of the screen (i.e. on turn 1 Tod has a choice of 3 pieces, NO a choice of 5).  The player with 5 pieces may not choose the exact pair in front of the screen of the other player (either one may be chosen, but not both pieces).  The chosen pieces are simultaneously revealed, and put in front of the player screens.

Resolving Movement


     No pieces match.  Each board piece that corresponds to a selected player piece may move one space.  (Four board pieces move)
     One piece is matched. Each board piece that corresponds to a non-matched, selected player piece may move up to two spaces.  (Two board pieces move).
     Both pieces match.  No board piece is moved.


Board pieces are moved in the sequence given in the Set-up Table, by the player who selected the corresponding player piece.  Each board piece moves from point to point on the grid.  No piece may pass through another piece or share a grid point.

The player with 4 player pieces in front of his screen now puts all his pieces behind his screen.

The turn sequence is now repeated with players choosing two of their remaining player pieces, simultaneously revealing them and doing any allowed moves they choose.
Play continues in this way until one or other player wins the game.

The Story of the Nibelungenlied

The Nibelungenlied is an epic poem written in Germany about 1200AD, though its sources are far older.  It tells how the peerless prince Siegfried from Xanten in the Netherlands, comes to Worms to court the beautiful Kriemhild.  However, King Gunther and his two brothers jealously guard their sister Kriemhild.  Gunther wishes to win the hand of Brunhild of Iceland, but she will only marry the man who can win three contests against her mighty strength.  Gunther and Siegfried strike a pact, whereby Siegfried will help Gunther win Brunhild's hand and in return he may marry Kriemhild.  Using his magic cloak, Siegfried secretly assists Gunther to defeat Brunhild, both on the field and in the bedchamber.  Unfortunately, Siegfried keeps Brunhild's ring and girdle, and ultimately bestows them upon his wife Kriemhild.  A small grievance leads the queens to fight, the ring and girdle are produced, and Brunhild is humiliated.   She enlists Hagen, the chief vassal of Gunther, to help her get vengeance, and Gunther and Hagen murder Siegfried while out hunting.  Kriemhild swears to exact revenge, marries the recently widowed King Etzel (Attila the Hun) and finally invites Hagen and her brothers to Attila's court, where in a crescendo of battle and blood, everyone dies and honour is redeemed.

Siegfried and Brunhild are clearly destined for each other, and in older versions of the story he is betrothed to her, but is bewitched away by Kriemhild.  The Natural Order would be that Brunhild is won fairly and that Siegfried may marry any woman that he chooses.  The forces of Tragic Destiny twist the natural order so that Brunhild is tricked by Gunther and Siegfried, or that Hagen and Gunther murder Siegfried to obtain his magic cloak.

The second half of the book contains 4 games, each with an A3 colour board, and monocolour pieces to cut out and assemble (most are folded like a triangle to make a stand-up piece with 2 faces.

The four games are:

Buffalo Hunters: for 2 to 4 players.  Players control a chief and a brave, and have the object of capturing horses and buffalo.  The animal pieces flee when an indian moves adjacent to them, so the trick is to drive them onto your other piece sitting in a stationary ambush or to drive them against an obstacle.  A horse doubles an indian's movement and is required to transport a dead buffalo back to camp.  Combat and theft of animals is permitted.

Red Cloud's War: for 2 players.  The US Govt player has to keep supply wagons rolling up the trail to Fort Keogh, the Red Cloud player needs to stop the wagons and starve Fort Keogh to surrender.

Iron Horse: for 2 to 4 players.  Use your surveyors and construction gangs to build your railroad to Central City before the other players.  This would be simple were it not for the Indian tribe which means you have to hire gunmen for protection.  Gunmen can also be used to terrorise other player's workers, or to have a shoot out with another gunman.  Some gunmen are better than others, and all will work for the player offering them the most money!

Lincoln County War: for 2 players.  Major Murphy and Sherriff Peppin take on Alexander McSween and Billy the Kid.  A real wild west shoot out, with the Kid's gang trying to break through to the Chisum spread before the rifles, pistols and Col. Dudley's Gatling gun mow down McSween or the Kid.

1. moving 1 space

A circular card with a visible category and 10 hidden items is placed into a viewer. A chart that is placed into the lower part of the viewer indicates which 2 players will play this round, and which will be giving the clues as opposed to guessing. The clue-giver presses a button to reveal each of the 10 items in turn and gives clues to the other player until the word is either guessed, or the clue-giver decides to pass. Passed words may not be revisited later. Once all 10 words have been gone through, or time runs out, each of those two players receive a point for each word that was guessed correctly. The next pair of players are then designated, a new category card is placed into the viewer, and the process is repeated until all of the pairings on the player chart have been completed. This tends to be a balancing factor, since all players get a round where they are paired with the better players, as well as the not-so-good players.

Michael's concept was to create a meta-game that allowed for rule-changing but had a fixed slate of  rules, unlike the fluid game of Nomic. The rules on 9 wood tiles determine how the players may move their pieces, trade the tiles, or even win. A rule is activated when a player's piece enters a correspondingly shaped tile, and the previously active rule is turned off. A placement phase precedes the movement stage. Experienced players can sometimes win even before movement begins. The strategy is intense because long-range moves are not calculable. For two players, Ages 12 and up.

Thematically, it is uses elements from a television series of the same name.  Players assume the roles of Wickie and his friends as they race each other to board a Viking ship.

Each player selects a character and takes four tokens.  They play their turns by first rolling the dice.  There are four lanes to reach the ship.  The squares (of which some are colored) on the lanes are printed with the faces of a die.  A player can move his or her token to the next square if one of the rolled dice matches the square's.  If the token moves onto a colored square, it can jump once to the next square of the same color.  Each character can take a short at certain points along the path.  As each square cannot accommodate more than one token, blocking is possible.  However, a token can jump across blocking pieces if the player has a die that matches the square at the opposite side of a block.

The game ends when one player gets all four of his or her tokens aboard the viking ship at the end, making him or her the winner.

The pawns are placed on the middle square at opposite ends of the board. Each player has to move his own pawn across the board to reach any square on the opposite side. Each turn a player can either move his pawn one square, or put a fence to close two square sides. When a player runs out of his own fences, he can only move the pawn.

Placed fences can not be removed. The only limit to placing them is that you can never totally close the enemy pawn: you have to leave a way, no matter how long, to reach its goal.

Players bid for starting position, then draw cards to dictate movement. Each card has various hazards listed. The active player shows their card to everyone, then secretly picks a set of results and writes it down. The opponents pay insurance based on what hazards they think will be on the active player's selected option. The active player then reveals their choice and moves based on the option chosen. If the opponents did not insure themselves against the hazards that appear, the active player collects money from them.

Each player distributes his points among six characteristics: Physical appearance, Culture, Charm, Money, Feelings, Eroticism. The first four of those scores are public the last two are secret. 
Each player also fixes the minimum scores for each characteristic of his/her ideal partner. 
The board depicts a city, divided into hexes. Players wander on it, looking for their ideal mate: a character of the opposite sex whose 4 open scores fits their secret goals. In the meantime, their own scores change: in the Gym the physical appearance increases (if there are no accidents...) while in the Fast food it can suddenly drop down!
When two characters suit each other with their 4 open characteristics, they can make a couplet. They then move together with a 4-sided die (instead that alone with a 6-sided one) until they reach a private house or a hotel. At this point they can show each other the two secret characteristics: if they don't fit they split apart. But if they fit, they win as soon as they reach the Cathedral or the City Hall.
Each hex of the map and each playing card has a humorous comment about each game effect.
To play, you do not need to have the same amount of male and female characters: you only need at least two males and two females. A rare quality of this game is that player can enter the game later or go away before the end with no problems.

The big one. Certainly one of the harder titles to track down. This is JZ, a.k.a. WJZ, the game created by WJZ-TV channel 13 in Baltimore, copyrighted by the Robert Goodman agency.

According to AH's Silver Jubilee guide, WJZ was never in the Avalon Hill line; having been the only game Avalon Hill ever published as a private-label job. [p.25] Aside from copies retained by Avalon Hill personnel, this game was distributed solely as a promotional item by WJZ-TV in Baltimore, MD (USA).

JZ bills itself as, The TV ad man's game. Two to six players compete for high score in the form of advertising accounts and advisory fees. Players can make their accounts more valuable with fortunate advertising time purchases.

Contents for the game are as follows:


     Instruction sheet
     Game board
     2 dice
     6 pawns
     6 strips for marking each accounts' class 
     24 pink Buy Time cards
     12 green Regional account cards
     12 blue Local accounts
     8 brown National account cards 
     2 small cardboard storage inserts


JZ comes in the standard flat box form typical of AH games made in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

The Buy Time cards, of course, are an exercise in shameless self-promotion by WJZ's advertising department -- both for the station and its parent company, Westinghouse. Some of the cards are now a bit dated, with references to buying time on the Buddy Deane Show and the Steve Allen Show.

Luck plays a far greater role than skill, as JZ is a simple roll-and-move game. Each player hopes to land on favorable spaces or draw cards that will allow them to land on and upgrade advertising accounts, going along the board until they bail out at Retirement or reach THE BITTER END.

It requires at least two players to play and can be played easily by four to six players.

One player takes on the role of the BrickMaster. His job is to create, using construction blocks, a variety of dungeon rooms in which the game will take place, and creatures to inhabit them. Ideally these rooms will be modular so they can be added to the table one at a time as players enter them or get sight of them.

The remaining players will play heroic characters who enter the dungeon in pursuit of gold and glory.

Since BrickQuest is a boardgame, it uses a higher level of abstraction than roleplaying games. Rather than trying to capture all the nuances of fantasy combat, it uses simplified rules for quick and balanced play.

If you are running a player without the ball, or if you are passing or shooting, you may use the pips on another die to change directions ( curve )  and move in that new direction.

Die rolls and line of sight determine combat results.

One unique, if somewhat destructive, aspect to this game is the provision made for land mines. Each player secretly positions two spring-driven mines under the board. When they deem the moment is right, they push a button on the mine, releasing the spring. This pushes a round disk up that, in theory, pushes the pegs up and scatters the affected soldiers. In practice, it tends to break the pegs on the soldiers.

The object of the game was to obtain the most pieces of eight by moving a man over the various colored circular spaces, from the starting space to the finish.

At the start of the game, each player draws an assignment card which tells them the documents they must find. For example, one card may tell them to get the Radio Messages from Project seafarer and the Micro-film of laser beam patterns. They travel through the spy headquarters visiting the Map Room, Radio Room, Microfilm Room and File Room and must carry their documents to the Vault.

What makes the game difficult is that there are hidden alarms throughout the headquarters. Whenever a player lands on an alarmed space the bell rings. The player must then draw an alarm card and go to the safe spot in the room on the card. As players move around the headquarters they must remember where the alarms are.

Whenever a player lands on the name location of one of the rooms they search the documents in that room and retrieve the one they are looking for. The first player to get all of their documents to the vault is the winner.

Divers Down is a knowledge game based on the sport of SCUBA diving. It is classified as a knowledge game instead of a triva game because the information in the game is based on the information that SCUBA divers need to know in order to safely participate in the sport.

The object of the game is for the player to complete three of the four possible dives (reef, wreck, deep or night). Each player starts on the surface. The player is then asked a question from a box of cards (similar to the question cards used in the game Trivial Pursuit). If the player answers correctly they descend to the next depth level. If they miss the question they move sideways towards the ABORT column. If the player ever lands in the ABORT column they must end the dive, return to the surface and start over again.

Once a player reaches the maximum depth for the dive the next question they answer takes them back to the surface. They are then given a certification card for that dive and may start another dive. The first player to be certified in three of the four dives is the winner.

Eagle  Strength through individual freedom as we soar to new heights of achievement.
Fire  Since the beginning of time man has nurtured its eternal flame.
Demon  A symbol of corrupted power waiting in the darkness to feed on the weak and helpless.
Throne  Rules of wealth dominate for themselves vast empires of property and people.
Serpent  In the garden was a serpent coiled and waiting to misguide and misdirect.
Cross  A universal symbol of good, we can always depend on the kindness of others.

It is the relationship between peoples morals, money, and their different goals that cause conflict and change.

We introduce The Ultimate Game. For the first time you can experience fantasy and reality with the imagination of role playing and the strategy of a board game. You can make the game come to life. The rules should guide, but not limit you. Welcome to our world. A new dimension of game playing awaits you.

--

Played on a fully painted board, a fantasy-induced image becomes the actual playing board. The game is started as pawns, much like in life. Movement is made by standard two 6d rolls. There are various hazards and events on the board and penalties and bonuses are paid in cash or movement limitations. Along the game path, there are six home bases of the various character images. A pawn can enter any one of his choosing and assume that character for the rest of the game. Character images may not harass pawns in any way.

At this point a player assumes his character image role and each player has different powers and functions. Primary functions include: Eagle receives a cash commission for ALL financial transactions in the game, Fire  sweeps  and moves players about the board, Demon harasses players and blocks them from advancing, Throne buys properties and investments that increase each round, Serpent harasses and robs players, and Cross saves players from being robbed, harassed, or burned (moved against their will) by Fire. There are dozens of specific other roles, functions and actions that each character may do, and image characters add a magic red die to their roles that also allows them to perform custom functions and actions, as well as common actions to all characters in the game.

The player with the most money/property at the end of the game wins.

The players can form teams and try to match teammates as the television series or each can play for oneself and try to match the plurality. Those who don't match the plurality pay a scoring chip to each player who did.

Six editions plus Fine, Collector's and a Briefcase Edition were published.

The was dropped from the title and the format of the game would be two players trying to match as many of the six answers as possible. A third player acts as moderator.

Scorched Earth uses Fire in the East as a base (and cannot be played without Fire in the East), adding more maps, counters, and rules. The game requires two players - one for the Germans and one for the Soviets - or two teams of players. The size of the game makes it well-suited for team play, with up to 3 or 4 players per side.

Scorched Earth's three maps extend the coverage of those in Fire in the East. The maps cover:
     The Volga River, from its heavily forested northwestern reaches to its mouth at the edge of the deserts of Asia; the western shores of the Caspian Sea; the Caucasus Mountains area of the USSR, to the borders of Turkey and Iran.

Scorched Earth's sixteen counter sheets (3840 counters total) encompass the diversity of forces in this theatre. All Axis forces engaged in the east are shown, from German through the Axis Allies (Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Rumanian, Slovakian), and including the eastern troops - Soviet citizens fighting against their government. The entire range of Soviet forces is given: regulars, guards, NKVD, militia, and the foreign contingents in the Red Army, including the Poles, Czechs, and even the German formations raised from prisoners of war. Over 40 different types of ground units are represented, from divisions (including division-sized Soviet Corps) to individual batteries of super-heavy artillery, such as tank corps, panzergrenadier divisions, artillery divisions, parachute brigades, and commando battalions. Aircraft units cover the many new aircraft sent to the front, such as the Fw 190 fighters and ground attack aircraft, Hs 129 tankbusters, A-20 and B-25 lend-lease bombers, Yak-9DD long-range fighters, and even late-war German jet aircraft.

Scorched Earth's rules expand upon those in Fire in the East to cover the rest of the war in the USSR. New features include:

    Abilities of new aircraft types  
    Partisan warfare
    Oilfields
    Surrender and defection of Germany's eastern front allies
    Continual upgrading of armored and mechanized forces
    Use of artillery divisions *Allied Lend-Lease to the USSR




Scorched Earth's orders of battle present in game terms the most detailed and accurate orders of battle ever published for the Russian front. The grand campaign game can be played to the end of 1944 from two starting points: from June 1941 or April 1942. The rules also allow the 1941 and 1942 campaigns to be played seperately, giving two campaign games shorter in playing time than the grand campaign game.  Scorched Earth covers the largest land campaign in history with the scope it deserves. It presents a detailed, exciting game situation, challenging and rewarding the players' strategic and tactical skills.

Players compete at gathering a prize-winning collection of animals, then returning home with their animals via the one international airport on the map. The types of winning collections (and the collection size limits) vary based on the number of players. Easily collected animals offer a smaller bonus than rarer beasts. Event cards and co-location both dictate whether a player successfully captures an animal for his collection.

In a single game, the first player to complete a collection will almost always end up with the most money even with the smallest award -able bonus. However, a series of games can be played which raises the importance of the value of one's collection.

Players may travel slowly on foot within a territory, and more quickly all over the board by plane. The more distant the target location, the more expensive the flight.

Animals may also be sold prior to the end of the game to gain working capital. This is necessary in some cases when a player spends his money flying across the board for a prize animal, only to have another player in the same location draw a capture card first from the event card deck.

For the most part, the game is also educational. Each animal card offers background on the particular animal. One exception is the humorous Lesser-Spotted Swamp Dragon card added in for a bit of humor.

In Big Bucks Baseball, getting to the playoffs and the World Series can bring you financial rewards. However, it is the player who has the most money at the end of the game that wins.

Each player is tasked with building a baseball team by drafting rookies, acquiring free agents, trading, etc. Free agents go a long way towards fulfilling the requirements for a post-season team, but cost money. Injuries can knock a key player off your roster, forcing you to acquire a replacement.

Shrewd and cunning trades, plus a bit of luck, can either give you the edge to clean up on post season bonuses or to squeak into the financial lead with a cheap non-contender.

In Them Bones, however, successfully extracting a bone allows you to move further ahead on the game board. Bumping the contact will cause a buzzer to buzz and the eyes to glow red.

The set of glow-in-the-dark bones associated with this game includes T-bones, Ham Bones, Trombones, and Funny Bones.

First player to reach the end of the board wins.

For an extra challenge, players can take advantage of the fact that the skull and bones glow in the dark by turning out the lights during the extraction attempts. (The skeletal hand on the spinner also glows in the dark, but you can't read the dial with the lights off.)

Movement is via an action point system, and unit capabilities are based around a single strength value which is used to determine melee, firing and morale. Different weapons apply a multiplier to the strength. The strength itself has a random component added to a base strength, the latter being derived from the unit's quality. Thus the exact competence of your units is unknown until you try them in battle.

Army lists in the rules cover all major, and many minor, conflicts in Europe from 1820 to 1920, whilst a separate army list book covers conflicts from the rest of the world, ranging from well-know ones such as the Zulu War and American Civil War through to the Yucatan Revolt and Dutch expansion in the East Indies.

Although the object of the game is to be the only player left on the board, the game encourages players to conquer large areas, build empires, manipulate up to date military equipment, and enter into political conspiracies with each other that are similar to those going on in our present day world (1985).

The 32.00 by 48.00 plastic game board consists of 55 water areas and 50 countries divided into seven groups or regions. Each player is provided with plastic playing pieces consisting of 60 cities, 12 jet aircraft, 12 tanks, 6 nuclear plants with cooling towers, 9 oil derricks, 3 Trident submarines, 3 New Jersey Class battleships, 3 Nimitz Class Nuclear Aircraft Carriers, 5 small #2 silver missiles, 4 large #5 gold missiles, and one black Infinity Missile (looks like an old fashioned Atom Bomb).

Turn order is determined by relative game position. Dice are used for resolving attacks and have symbols on them instead of numbers. Whenever you rolled mushroom clouds on all the dice you were rolling you draw an 'Act of God' card, which adds and destroys pieces and other factors. The most attractive part of the game is the custom made plaster mushroom clouds, 75 of which are included with the basic set, to keep the games name true to meaning.

Available expansion kits include; Cruise Missiles, #8 Missiles, Air Transports, Capitols, Spies, and Dictators. There are also custom made War Room sets, and intermediate sets with standard cardboard counter pieces available. Pieces of the game and player part sets are all individually available, and customer specified (custom) colors for playing pieces are offered as well.

Cards are the 3 Combatants, Weapons and Mystics (spells and damage), Guardians and Attack cards.

After each player lays out his Combatants, a Player, during his turn, will have 1-3 cards to play from his hand of 7: lay out required weapons or trade-in's to seek cards he needs from his deck. He then announces he is open to attack and the Opponent will then try to strip off weapons or damage the player. When the attack is done, the next play is the Turn-Player and has 3 cards to play, etc. Defense from Opponent's attack is played from cards left in hand after the 1-3 turn-cards are played.

COMBATANT REQUIREMENTS: 2 Warriors each get a Shield, Helmet, Sword and Spear. 1 Archer gets a Helmet, Bow and Quiver.

The game is configured and sold for 2 Player action (optimal play). With 3-4 players, each Player, on his turn, will tactically decide who his Opponent will be for that turn. Other players, with special cards can occasionally butt in. 3 Player action can get pretty hot because of this. 4 Player action, does get a bit slow and though able for play, is not the optimal number of players. 2-3 Players is what turns this game on!

Gorlice-Tarnow Breakthrough: May 1915

The head of the German armies, von Falkenhayn, wants the focus of the German operations in the war to be on the western front. Yet to make this a reality, he feels that relief must first be provided to the endangered Austro-Hungarians. Recent Russian pressure had almost cracked the final Austro-Hungarian defensive lines in the Carpathians, and new pressure was being brought to bear on Germany's weak ally by the Italians, who had just entered the war.

To help the Austro-Hungarians, a new German army is formed under the capable von Mackensen, and placed in the line east of Crackow. After a furious hurricane barrage, von Mackensen attacks and completely pierces the Russian lines. A Russian retreat ensues that enables the Central Powers' forces to recapture most of Galicia.

Von Falkenhayn wanted to stop operations at this point and shift to the west, but pressure from the Kaiser, at the insistance of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, resulted in a widening of the offensive. Attacks were then launched in the northern sector of the eastern front as well. Enveloped on two sides, the Russians reacted with their classic response, a retreat back into Russia, leaving Russian Poland to the Germans.

The Central Powers offensive wound down as they struggled to supply troops hundreds of miles past the supply heads. The offensive has saved Austria-Hungary from immediate peril, but it does not knock Russia out of the war. And instead of enabling von Falkenhayn to focus on the west, most of the newly created German forces are fed into the increasing vastness of the eastern front.

The Brusilov Offensive: June 1916

In response to French pleas for help to relieve the pressure at Verdun, the Russian STAVKA authorizes a major offensive. General Brusilov plans attacks all along the front of his Southwest Army Group aiming primarily at Austro-Hungarian positions. His belief is that attacks across the width of his front will prevent the enemy from being able to quickly reinforce areas under local attack.

The Austro-Hungarians are caught off-guard as their focus is a new offensive of their own in Italy. The Russian attacks achieves numerous breakthroughs in numerous sectors and many Austro-Hungarian units are completely routed. The Russians take hundreds of thousands of prisoners and advance tens of miles, recapturing significant cities.

German reinforcements are rushed from the north and from Verdun. The Germans also take over command of almost the entire eastern front, and Austria-Hungary is placed in a subserviant position. The Russian offensive peters out as Brusilov's forces start to experience supply shortages, and Central Powers' resistance stiffens.

Brusilov had planned on support from Russian armies to the north to pin down German forces with attacks of their own, but they failed to support him. The losses mount and, after months of fighting, the Russians finally call a halt to further attacks.

The Brusilov Offensive did relieve the pressure on the French and it came very close to knocking Austria-Hungary out of the war. Had Brusilov been supported by his peers to the north, and by the Russian Allies (including the hesitant Romanians) the war might well have been won by the Entente in 1916.


This game contains 2 scenarios covering the Gorlice-Tarnow offensive of 1915 and the Brusilov Offensive of 1916.

NOTE: This is not a stand-alone game. It requires the ownership of Tannenberg: Eagles in the East / Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron and Serbia the Defiant / Romania: Transylvanian Gambit to play.

The playing board is a map of the five landing beaches and surrounding areas divided into 120 different sectors with a variety of different terrain types including water, beach, field, forest and towns.

The playing pieces are cardboard squares representing AA guns, Artillery, Bombers, coastal Guns, Fighters, Landing craft, Soldiers, Tanks, U-Boats and Warships.

Game play is turn based. The rulebook is short and sweet, at only eight pages in length. This does lead to some confusion, however, as some of the rules need clarifying.

This game was released in Canada.

In the first, you are given a word (HAM, for example) and have to create a four line rhyme:  Have you seen my brother Sam?  Lately he#039;s been such a ham.  He was desperate for money, and in a jam.  So he went on a comedy show dressed as madame.

Players then vote on whether you told a good story.  If you did, keep going.  If not, pass your turn.

Other challenges include making a rhyme using 4 of 6 given words, an all play category where everyone takes turns rhyming a particular word until someone can#039;t, and the last which requires you recall two line rhymes from literary or musical works (If you step on a crack, you#039;ll break your mother#039;s back, or, All the way with LBJ).

Like many of these games, it ends by answering a challenge given by your opponents.

7767,Gladiators,1975,5.79167,12,2,2,20,20,20,Wargames,Ancient Fighting Miniatures Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterSimultaneous Action Selection,"A game of gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome. Played using counters or miniatures figures (54mm or 25mm) on a hex grid. For two or more players.

Gladiators was designed as a system for single figure miniatures combat. But it is more like a role-playing game's combat system than a traditional miniatures system. Combat takes place on a hex grid making Gladiators similar in nature to Steve Jackson's Melee system (the combat system which evolved into The Fantasy Trip which eventually evolved into GURPS). Of course, the rules are a bit more specialized than Melee in that they focus on the gladiator combat of ancient Rome.

Gladiators took two years of play-testing and conceptual development to create. A set of playable yet detailed and realistic rules for simulating gladiatorial combat. Players will be able to move their gladiators, feint, and dodge about as they prepare to lunge at their adversaries. They can slash or jab at their chosen targets, and must parry the return blows of their opponent. Shields can be used to bash opponents off guard. Accidents also have a place in this simulated universe. Men can trip or stumble, weapons or shields can be dropped, or nets cut to shreds. In short, an imaginative player can momentarily enter the arena and prepare himself for a contest which will be won or lost by the same elements that brought victory or defeat, fame and wealth or sudden death to a gladiator. Skills, cleverness, foresight, and luck all play their respective roles.

These rules open a new dimension of wargaming--the realistic and exciting simulation of one man versus one man in the arena. Give them a try. You'll find a game hard to beat for moments of challenge.

Contains 1 cardstock sheet of tables printed on both sides and 1 cardstock hex sheet printed on both sides (2 difference sized hexes, one size on each printed side).

Several aspects are covered in these rules that are normally not found in other wargaming rules for the modern period, such as tunnel warfare and pungi sticks. Although large formal battles can be fought (and sometimes were in Vietnam), the main thrust of this rulebook is guerrilla and counter-insurgency warfare.

Giac My is designed to simulate small unit combat in Southeast Asia, but it can be used for 'liberation wars' anywhere, or small unit infantry combat in general. Obviously,, many facets of unconventional warfare are difficult to simulate in a gaming format. However, we have tried to include whatever is applicable (and feasible) for tactical level engagements of a reasonable size. We hope that these rules will be well received by those interested in modern miniatures wargaming.

Scale: one inch equals ten meters, one turn is forty seconds. Each figure equals one man or vehicle.

Alternate title: The game is labeled GI'AC MY on the cover, but referred to as Giac My throughout the rules.

The object of these rules is to simulate and simplify aspects of 18th Century linear warfare. The play should be limited to what the rules specify in order to get the feel of the rigid, formal, and deliberate maneuvers and combat characteristic of the military doctrine of the era. Playability is the thrust of these rules, not complexity. Included are rules for setting up a campaign series of games, but players wishing more expansive campaigns will find the basics herein to enlarge upon. To reflect the conditions of the American theater during the various times of combat, heavy cavalry has been omitted -- but militia, riflemen, and natives (Indians) are included. With additions and adjustments of a minor nature, these rules will be eminently suitable for European warfare in the same period.

The object of the game is to deliver as many of the 15 customers as you can to their destinations and earn as much money as you can.  The game ends in one of two ways. All the customers get delivered or your taxi gets hauled off the road with too many Demerit Points against it.

There's lots to do before the night is over besides just delivering fares to their destinations. Events are happening all over the city while there are speeding tickets to deal with, grabbing that necessary cup of coffee when you get tired, getting through traffic jams, past construction sites, watching out for thieves, keeping an eye on the gas gauge, fixing failing brakes. It will be a night to remember, no matter what happens!

In other words, have a profitable Season and avoid losing our shirts. Profits and losses are split equally. Bottom line is to put on Plays that people enjoy and to make some money doing so.

Hey, what is to worry about? Critics? Yes, they can be scary alright! What if we work our hearts out and they hate the Play? The Technicians? Yes, things can go wrong with the lighting, sound, costumes, and set. Or maybe the Director is a tyrannical brute making the sweet ingenue weep and spoil her make-up. But it was Alfred Hitchcock who said that Actors may not be animals, but they should be treated like animals? And, the Writers, oh the Writers! They can be brilliant and they can be without conscience. The Actors and Actresses? Perhaps the odd tantrum, forgetting of lines, scene stealing...?

The Meeting hall is the heart of the community. If we succeed in building a community, we all win together. A medium-complicated game that explores both material and spiritual values.

Players cooperate in this draw-cards-and-move game, moving around a track, collecting resources and trying to supply enough resources to recreation, industry, necessities, education and inner life to create a complete community. The game also uses event cards including love, unity, work, plain-speaking and bad feeling cards, which players accumulate.

Depending on which variants are used, the players can lose, unlike some co-operative games. This can happen if the players don't have any resources to pay for a harmful event, or if all the players are immobilized.

Players: 4 are ideal, but more or less can certainly play and sometimes a very exciting game can be played with ten.

You have eight pieces, six knights, strength eight down to three, A Herald, valued at two, and a trumpeter, valued at one. A piece can capture any piece with a lower value. However a trumpeter will lose to any piece which attacks it but will defeat the number eight knight if it attacks. If two knights of the same strength meet the attacker wins.

Like in Dou Shou Qi the trumpeter (the Rat in Dou Shou Qi) is the only piece allowed to go through the fenced off areas (the river in Dou Shou Qi). However, unlike in Dou Shou Qi, it is the seven and eight knights (the Elephant and Lion in Dou Shou Qi) who can jump over the fenced off areas.

The game is essentially what R.C. Bell has described as the Jungle Game. The theme has just been changed from jungle animals to knights. See The Board Game Book, or Board and Table Games from many Civilizations.

7968,Constellation Station,1990,4,5,0,2,6,45,45,,Educational Space Exploration Trivia ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Text from introduction:

The starry sky is full of lore and legend. Learning about the constellations, or star patterns, is often a first step into amateur sky watching and ultimately the study of astronomy and space science.

In Constellation Station you will encounter interesting information about the stars and constellations while you are enjoying the game.  As you play you will find yourself learning the names of all the leading constellations in the northern sky, some of the brightest stars they contain, and other basic information about them.

The game board has a big sky map surrounded by a hemisphere wheel. The map provides a general picture of where the constellations are in relation to one another. The named spaces of the Hemisphere Wheel point to the corresponding constellation on the Sky Map.  The constellation can be found by following a straight line from the name on the wheel to its map location.

The game can be an introduction to sky watching outdoors. After playing the game, turn out the lights to see the stars on the game board glow-in-the-dark.  Practice recognizing the star patterns.  Then go out and see the night sky! You might want to make up your own stories and legends about the star patterns you see.

The game board map by itself won't identify which stars are where in the sky, since that depends on the date, time of the night and latitude on earth.  Good guidebooks and other sky watching aids that take these things into account are described in the suggested reading section. Have fun and keep looking up!

The game is designed for 25mm miniatures, but is adaptable to 15mm. Each miniature represents one warrior with his own physical attributes, weapons, and combat skills.

BattleLust is designed for any number of players. Each player typically commands a company of about twenty warriors, but an experienced player can operate two or more companies. BattleLust is compatible with our role-playing HrnMaster rules. The game can be used as a quick combat system for HrnMaster , or you can use HrnMaster as a source of optional advanced rules for BattleLust.

BattleLust provides a strong contrast to the usual fantasy miniatures game. There are no dragons and monsters here. While there are strong men and weak men, no single hero dominates the battlefield. There is no gunpowder, no war wagons, and no suits of plate armor. Instead, this is a game solidly based on the realities of medieval warfare.

7997,Bullwinkle Hide-N-Seek,1961,2.8,5,0,0,0,10,10,Children's,Children's Game Movies / TV / Radio theme ,,"A Bullwinkle themed boardgame variant on hide-n-seek.  
(Bullwinkle is a fictional moose character from the 1959-1964 animated television series Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show.)

Theme
Players play a hide-and-seek game with Bullwinkle and his friends.

Goal
Scoring the most points by finding picture chips which have been hidden on the balloon spots on the board.

Game play
Each of the two player gets a player's board and the 24 cardboard chips of the same colour.
The player boards show Bullwinkle with 24 balloons, grouped into six groups of four.
Each set of cardboard chips is composed of 14 blank chips, 8 picture chips (showing characters from the show) and 2 chips that have 'HOT' printed on them. At the bottom of the board, you see how many points (ranging from -3 to 5) you earn by finding which character.

At the start of the game, each player hides the characters by placing his/her cardboard chips on the balloon spots on his/her player board, blank side up and without the other player seeing which character goes where.

Rules for hiding:

     HOT chips are hints for the other player and have to be placed in a balloon group that contains at least one picture chip.
     One or more picture chips, with or without a HOT chip, may be in a group of 4 balloons.
     It is allowed to make a group of 4 blank chips.




After the hiding phase, players switch boards and the seeking phase starts. Players now take turns turning over two chips on their board according to the following rules:


     Two chips from any group or groups of balloons may be turned over.
     A HOT chip indicates that there is at least one picture chip in that group.
     When a player finds a picture chip, he/she places it on the corresponding area of the board.
     Finding one of the two characters with negative points not only loses the player that number of points, it also restricts his actions to turning over one (instead of two) chips per turn for the rest of the game.


If a player finds both of the two characters with negative points, the game ends immediately.
The game also ends when one player has found all six characters worth positive points.

After the game has ended, each player adds up his/her points. The player with the highest score wins the game.

7998,Hyperchess,2003,8.5,2,2,2,2,120,120,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Grid Movement,"From the manufacturer:

Hyperchess is an intriguing extension of chess into the third dimension. It is, so far as we know, the first and only playable form of chess in three dimensions. A number of attempts have been made over the years to extend chess into three dimensions, but in one way or another each has suffered some flaw that has compromised the integrity of the basic game, and therefore none has been generally accepted. We feel that Hyperchess overcomes these problems and is for the first time a viable three-dimensional version of chess.

The regular rules of chess apply in Hyperchess, and the object of the game remains the same--to checkmate the opponent's king.  In addition, the game is played on the same number of board squares as traditional chess, with the same number of chessmen who keep their same moves.  The dramatic difference is, of course, that play is extended into the next dimension.  Each chessman may move vertically as well as horizontally.  This opens up exciting new possibilities for the world's oldest and most popular game.

Originally created as an independent spin-off from the Warhammer Fantasy Battle rules, it was subsequently brought back in-house at Games Workshop and now functions as a separate division of the company. Some of the rules inconsistencies that the parent game is so famous for have been ironed out, as have some of the more outrageously unrealistic rules. Don't expect massive historical accuracy though: the emphasis is still on a fun, playable system over real historical or military realism. The rulebook tells you everything you need to play the game and comes with two generic army lists for Romans and Barbarians. The authors actively encourage players to get their miniatures from a range of different manufacturers. Further army list supplements are available and you'll need to supply your own scenery too!

Theme
Signore Spinosi, an old mafia boss, has learned that a gang of young mafiosi is plotting his demise. But they have reckoned without their host - old Spinosi isn't fooled that easily. He sends six of his most trusted spies to uncover the conspirators. You are one of his confidants. Will you be the first to uncover all 8 members of a conspirator gangs?

Goal
Be the first to find and reveal all 8 wooden discs of the colour determined by the card you draw at the beginning of the game.

Game play
The 50 wooden discs (48 of them with a face in one of 6 colours) are shuffled face down and then placed on the board. The 6 cards are also shuffled. Each player draws a card, remembers its colour and places it face-down in front of him/herself.

Players take turns looking at the face-down side of one of the discs (without showing it to the other players). The active player may either uncover the mafioso (= put him back face-up) or just put him back. If the player reveals him, he/she gets a second try. If not, it's the next player's turn now. If the second mafioso is also revealed, the active player gets a third and final attempt, on which he/she always has to mask an already revealed mafioso (= return the disc face-down). A player's turn always ends after a maximum of three attempts.
A player's turn also ends when he/she looks at one of the two discs without a face, and these cannot be revealed.

The game ends when all 8 conspirators of one colour have been uncovered (unless that colour is not attributed to a player, which can happen with fewer than six players). The player with that colour card wins the game.

8026,Video Fighter: Dragons of Fury,1994,5.375,20,1.75,2,8,45,45,,Card Game Fighting ,Action Point Allowance SystemHand ManagementTrick-takingVariable Player Powers,"Video fighter is the name of the martial arts combat card game produced by Dream Pod Nine. It is designed for those of you out there who are avid players of such games as Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat and other one-on-one arcade-action games. It was designed for fast-paced combat and dynamic maneuvers. The only real difference between this game and the arcade version is that you dont have to insert a coin every time you lose.

The designers of this game, have played most of the combat games available out there. They have been consistently defeated by the younger and faster teenagers who spend up to their last quarter learning better ways to humiliate them. Consequently, they came up with this game, hoping that if you couldnt defeat them, you could at least save a few bucks. The designers hope the player have as much fun playing the game as they had designing it.

Component:
8 Character cards and tokens,
Rule book,
108 action cards.

The game is driven by cards, which are used to acquire troops and to fight battles. Players each have a piece which moves around a track by die roll; the space landed on determines how many cards the player draws and how many troops are auctioned off (bidding is conducted with cards). Sets of cards can be turned in for troops in addition to those auctioned off. The track is also the game clock: there is a neutral piece which moves around it and determines when scoring occurs and when the game ends.

RENAISSANCE OF INFANTRY (originally Strategy  Tactics magazine #22) (Tactical Warfare, 1250AD to 1550AD)


     20 different scenarios
     Melee and Fire combat
     Bonus PanzerBlitz mini-game


Re-fight the battles of Bannockburn, Crecy, Bicocca, Agincourt and many more. Renaissance of Infantry marks the beginning of a whole new line of games. The units in the game are composed of no more than 500 men. Each hex represents 100 meters and each turn represents approximately 20 minutes.

During this historical period, the mounted man-at-arms (or knight in shining armor) fell prey to the better organized and disciplined infantry. After eight hundred years of dominance, the armored horseman again became a second class warrior. The game shows how, and why, infantry lost their traditional dominance -- and how they regained it. There are 20 different games.  Each is a historical battle with its own order of battle, set-up and victory conditions.  Some of the units included in the game are: militia pikemen, crossbowmen, pikemen, arquebusiers, swordsmen, longbowmen and heavy cavalry.

In the game, one player plays the United States (CIA), the other plays the Soviet Union (KGB). The objective of the game is to get a spy into the opponent's embassy on the other side of the wall.

Each player has six spies. Each turn, they roll a die, and move one of their spies through the streets of Berlin. When landing on a special square, they have the ability to kill an enemy spy, send him back to his embassy or transport themselves to another square on the board (using a secret tunnel, an embassy car etc.).

A special element of the game is that among the six spies of each player, there are two double agents. During the game, players sometimes get the chance to study their opponent's spies to identify their true allegiance. If a player moves a spy into his opponent's embassy and it turns out to be a double agent, he loses the game instead of winning it.

8057,1944: Second Front,1990,5.61458,24,4,1,2,300,300,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Dice RollingHex-and-Counter,"1944: SECOND FRONT begins with the Allies well established in France following the D-Day invasions. The Allies are gathered to attempt their breakout and begin the race toward the German frontier. Each player has Combat Units and Headquarters available, and is capable of maneuvering across the map and engaging enemy pieces in combat. You must master the deceptively concise rules for Activation and Movement Point expenditure. And at any given time, you will face the decision of which army to Activate in any one phase - and your opponent will have an immediate opportunity to react . The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality. There is a track display that you use during movement/combat. As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions. It's easier to play than it is to describe.  For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.  The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements). Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.

8062,The X Game,1997,3,7,0,2,4,60,60,,Trivia ,Roll / Spin and Move,"A trivia game where players collect colored stones for answering questions correctly.  The object of the game is to collect all colors of stones and move to the central square of the board (similar to Trivial Pursuit).  The four categories of trivia are: Parapsychology, Science, Theology, and Occult.

Four of the stone colors are collected by answering a question correctly of the appropriate color, you can only have one stone of each color.  The fifth stone (black), is special, there is only one of them.  It is collected by either moving your pawn to the center of the board, or stealing it from another player (by landing on the same board square as their pawn.)

There is a special rule variant that allows players who have collected stones to use them after a six is rolled on the movement die.  Each color gives the player some kind of advantage (free movement, card skipping, etc).  As well, you get to keep the cards that you have answered correctly (though only one at a time), and use them in much the same way as you use the stones.

From the back of the box.

Why? This question has plagued humanity since... well... forever. It is what drives people and science to explain the unknown. While others embrace the unknown, some fear it... but that's why this is a GAME.

The X-Game combines current knowledge of our world into a fascinating combination of Science, Paranormal, Theology and the Occult trivia. The X-Game contains 1000 questions on 250 cards, 16 Power Stones, 4 Player Pieces, 4 Power Cards, 1 Black Power Stone, instructions and a fantastic playing board. Anywhere from 2 players can compete for the glory of winning (abducting) the Black Power Stone and the rest of the X-Game...

8088,Scrabble Rebus,1986,4.68182,22,1.6667,2,4,60,60,,Educational Puzzle Word Game ,Pick-up and DeliverTile Placement,"There are 108 tiles. Each tile depicts an icon, a letter or diphthong. Tiles have been color-coded into four different types. Players draw two tiles from each set randomly. Each player, in turn, tries to make a sentence or phrase using the tiles in their hand and intersecting those tiles already on the 15 by 15 game board.

The tiles are used to make Rebus words or sentences (similar to using the letter tiles in Scrabble to make words) which are placed on the squares of the 15x15 grid game board. A Rebus is a word or sentence where a symbol replaces part of the word or sentence. For example: if you laid a tile with a picture of a letter S followed by a tile with a picture of an oar (from a rowboat) the the Rebus would read: sore.

The rule book comes with a description of each tile (in case you didn't know just what the picture is) as well as an example of use for each tile. These descriptions come in very handy when playing the game both for stopping player arguments as well as helping out stumped players.

Players score three points for each tile used. Premium squares give players bonuses. Using all eight tiles held scores a fifty point bonus.  Highest score wins.

They published this game as a means to collect funds and to educate people about the economic problems in the world.

The game is basically monopoly, with some changes:
- After the first round, your income is determined by means of the resources (streets) bought in the first round. The resources you have have to match those of existing countries; each player selects the best (richest) country that matches his resources. A richer country means a higher salary.
- The goal of the game is to become a multinational (that is, have a set of resources complete). At this point, you are no longer a single country, but a multinational (With the highest salary in the game). If you manage to keep this title long enough, you win the game.
- When you land a street owned by someone else, you have to pay a fee, but after that, you are allowed to buy it from him. This way, multinationals can be 'broken'; the player then selects a new country.

The poorer countries are helped by the chance cards, which often award money to the poorer countries, while asking money from the richer countries. The richer countries are still better off, though...

1 counter = 1 army or 1 fleet; 1 turn = 3 months.

In the basic version, the game does not cover the China Incident, the Soviet 1945 offensive, or the attack on Pearl Harbor, which is accounted for in the Allied set-up. It is primarily a solitaire game. In actuality, only one side had the initiative at a given time. The Japanese struck first and occupied much of the area, but after the Solomons, were unable to continue the offensive. Then the Allies, after the disastrous start, launched their offensive of reconquest and the capitulation of Japan.

The rules have been designed for two players to carry out small scale skirmishes with each player in control of a unit of Imperial Marines, Dark Disciples, Star Patrolmen, or independent gangs.

Most of the rules are pretty standard tabletop miniature skirmish rules.  Each unit may move a certain number of inches per turn, may fire a ranged weapon, and/or engage in close combat with models in close proximity.  No grid is used for movement, a ruler is used to measure linear distances.

Unlike the massive armies sported by the game's descendants, Spacefarers focuses on single squads, and allows for more detail, such as rudimentary hit location, along with different armor protection for each location, and individually equipped models.  The game appears to have much more in common with games like Necromunda or Mordheim in this respect.

The rules are short, only 44 pages, with sparse hand-drawn artwork; not a single photograph is used.  Two introductory scenarios are included, rules are included for constructing your own forces.  Depending on which force you choose to represent, you get a certain amount of money to use to buy equipment, and the rules indicate how large your squad will be (in one case, it's random!).

Odd cards have subtraction and division questions; answering them correctly moves the player's token backwards.

The offensive player has 3 turns to play a card (1/turn) and get a shot off. The offensive player can move and pass the ball around, the defensive player move to block the offensive player, steal the ball, or block the shot. If the offensive player does not get a shot off by the end of the 3rd turn, its a turnover.

The closer you are to the basket, the easier the shot. There are two ways to resolve shots, either a simple roll of the twelve-sided die, with longer shots being tougher, or by a little dexterity shot where you flick a basketball up on a slightly angled board, and try to get it in the basket. The farther away you are on the main board, the further back you have to attempt the dexterity shot with.

If you move your beginner piece onto one of the 5 fish pieces, you can take a photograph. There is a pile of cards for each of the 5 fish pieces. A good shot is worth more than a blurry shot. You can take more than one picture of the same fish over different turns, but only get to count the best shot for each of the 5 pieces for determining your score.

There is usually barely enough time to take pictures of all 5 pieces if you just take one shot of each, but sometimes there's not even that much time.

The pitcher selects a pitch card and places the card face down (the batter will only know if it's a 'slow' or 'fast' pitch), and places the ball on a square representing the location of the ball. The batter choosing to let the ball pass (if he thinks it'll be a ball), to bunt, or swing. To swing, he places the bat over 4 locations where he thinks the ball may end up. The pitcher then reveals the pitch, and rolls a die to see how many spaces and what direction the pitch moves to determine the final location of the pitch. Curve balls will move a few spaces inwards, a sinker downwards, and so on.

If the ball is hit, the batter rolls a die, and adds a bonus based on which of the 4 locations he covered the ball was thrown to (he may have a +4 to any pitch thrown to the upper right location, but no bonus for the other three squares, for example). For the most part, the higher the roll the better, and you get the results for the hit, such as double play, hit, double, and so on.

Sangue Blu

Sir Reginald MacFergh has been murdered with a blow from a fireplace poker. In one corner of the dining room is his wife, in tears and suffering from shock. What happened here?
A characteristically Sherlockian episode, Blue Blood takes place against the backdrop of a society divided in two: On one side, the nobilityproud of their peerage and contemptuous with their inferiors; on the other side, the humble servants searching for a way to defend their dignity.
The rigid British society of the late 1800's sets the tone for rendering the performance of these entertaining and original characters.

The players move their pieces on two interweaved but separate sets of paths, and movement/capture is somewhat reminiscent of a 2-dimensional Mancala - a stack of pieces is moved by dropping one piece off the stack in every space it moves into, and opposing pieces can be captured if the last piece ends next to them and certain requirements are met (they have to be surrounded, basically).

The object of the game is to capture the opponent's City, the middle space on their closest row.

An unusual feature is that if an enemy piece is captured by overkill (pieces are captured by neighboring pieces which are stronger, strength being measured by the number of adjacent friendly pieces), a red massacre token is placed on its space, which becomes impassable for the rest of the game.

The Crystal of Power is the focal point of the universe, binding the fabric of time.  
In the first age, the Gods fought for control of the crystal through their demi-gods the DragonLords.  When the DragonLords clashed the force unleashed was enough to shatter the Crystal of Power.  Shards of the Crystal were thrown to the far reaches of our world, and I suspect even punched through the barriers of time.
The second age was a time of darkness and chaos was upon us with the passing of the great crystal.  You are  our last hope.  I pass to you a great and terrible burden, a shard of the Crystal of Power.  Use it and rule wisely.  Save our people, gather the shards and re-forge the Crystal of Power.

Now 5 or 6 players can embark on a Quest for the DragonLords.  Two new races fight for control of the shards.  The Amazons are skilled in the art of combat and have the ability to charm their opponents.  The Necromancers are the most feared, with the knowledge to raise the fallen.  The Crystal of Power - The 5 to 6 player expansion comes complete with all new adventures and even more powerful spells.

1 set of Necromancer plastic miniatures (45)

Pacific at War is a multi-player military strategy game taking place in the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. Players must fight battles successfully to win territories and therefore increase their income. The more income a player has, the more buying power he has to purchase the combat units necessary to win battles and gain territories.

In order to achieve their goals, the players have at their disposal playing pieces representing infantry, armor, artillery, fighters, bombers and various types of naval vessels. A player must use clever strategy and planning and purchase units wisely in order to make the most of his resources.

The Japanese player starts the game at war with China. He must decide how much military equipment he wants to commit and for how long before the United States and Britain are brought into the war.

The Chinese player must attempt to inflict as many Japanese casualties as possible and hold out until the Allies enter the war.

The U.S. and Britain will enter the war simultaneously. Until then, they can only prepare the best they can for the inevitable Japanese attack...

Players each receive four cards, corresponding to themselves and the other three racers in the game (rules are included for 2 and 3 players). Players
also start with 5 oranges in their provisions (tracked on a scorepad). A neutral party begins to flip over the remaining cards one by one. Some are Way cards (no effect; anyone playing cards loses an orange), some are good actions (gain oranges), and some are bad (lose oranges).
The action cards contain ranking(s) (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th), and the corresponding gain or loss for each ranking. When one of these actions comes up, players play one or two cards into a central area. These cards are then picked up and sorted through by the neutral players, discarding the second and succeeding instances of a given racer's card
(so, if the corresponding cards played were racers 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, the order for card resolution would be 1, 3, 4, 2). The players corresponding to the played cards' rankings then either gain or lose oranges based on the ranks shown on the action card. The player with the most oranges after races equal to the number of players wins.

Winceby uses the Royalists & Roundheads system originally published by 3W. It is a representation of the cavalry battle that took place outside of the small village of Winceby on October 11, 1643. This battle helped secure the county of Lincolnshire for the Parliament. Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax, important figures in the English Civil War showed their mettle in this small but significant battle,

In game terms, Winceby is a significant addition to the Royalists  Roundheads series as it introduces the new Charge command for cavalry units, more clearly defines the rules governing routed combat units, and includes rules for dismounted Dragoon units.

Each turn the Sheriff reveals a new High Noon card which every player must obey for the entire turn.

For example, during Hangover all characters lose their special abilities. With Blessing the suit of every card becomes Hearts (so, Barrels always work and Dynamite never explodes, etc.).

Even if you're already out of the game you can even come back as a ghost for a turn during the Ghost Town phase, and try to win!

In the Wild West, the shootouts between the Outlaws and the Sheriff are becoming particularly tough. Players must be ready to welcome the Dalton Gang, keep cool during the Gold Rush and be really careful when walking in the ghost town!

This first expansion for BANG! is very cheap and easy to play.

Play proceeds in a continuous 3-round cycle. Each round consists of an Auction Phase (one auction) and an Action Phase (executing one or several actions on the board). After every Third Round, a Scoring Round occurs. Power Cards are awarded, according to the distribution of Agents in each Site. Some of these Power Cards award a single Victory Point, which is needed to win the game. After 3 Rounds, the cycle begins again. The game ends immediately, if a player acquires the required number of Victory Point Cards or if, after a Scoring Round, there aren't enough new Power Cards to place 3 Power Cards for each Site. The game is a compelling race against the clock, as the players struggle to choose the right Auction Cards, effectively distribute their Agents on the game board, and win Power Cards that allow them to execute special actions early in the game (often, confounding teams of rival Agents), and award Victory Points later in the game.

Players secretly select cards from their collection and simultaneously reveal them.  Normally a company beats a person, a person beats a game and a game beats a company.  However, if one card lists the other (i.e., the person worked for the company) then the victory is reversed.  Ties are broken according to the star, diamond and shield stats on the cards.  (Compare stars, diamonds and shields in that order until the tie is broken.)  The star statistic is dependent on the Origins awards and is equal to nominations + 2*wins + 5*hall_of_fame_listings.  Every autograph on the card that matches a name listed on the card is worth an additionally 5 stars.

The second set of cards should appear at the 2004 Origins convention (the 2003 Origins convention was supposed to have the second set, but there were problems).  Cards for inactive games, companies and designers can be requested cheaply.

The game ends with a checkmate.

The strategic cubes move the number of squares shown on their top face, and each step of the move rolls the die to its adjacent face (thus the new top side is determined be the sequence of horizontal and vertical steps).  Shields move so that one of their two covered squares stays the same.  The master moves one spot orthogonally.  (Additional moves for shields and strategic cubes exist in the advanced version.)

Captures are made by moving onto other pieces, except that shields require one half to be put in check and the other half to be moved onto.  If the master moves to the far end of the board it can be returned to its original position and replaced with a captured piece.

Designed by Markus Stumptner, Solomon Sea simulates the World War II carrier battles for control of the sea lanes around the Solomon Islands, from May to November 1942. One player commands the Allied (US and Australian) forces and the other the Japanese. Victory is obtained by destroying the opposing fleets, landing invasion forces, or bringing supplies to beleaguered beachheads. 
 Solomon Sea is a double blind 2-player game, which means each player moves his task forces, air strikes, and search planes on his own map, and tells the other player about the hexes he searches. Combat is resolved by a series of dice rolls. Each hex represents a diameter of 100 nautical miles, with 3 hours per turn. Each counter represents 6 to 10 planes, individual carries, or groups of smaller ships. Four scenarios are included: Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz, and Guadalcanal. 
 Solomon Sea won the 2000 Charles S. Roberts award for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame.

8338,I Giochi del 2000: Elemental Wars,1997,6.66667,9,1.75,2,5,20,20,,Card Game Fantasy Fighting ,Card DraftingCo-operative Play,"Elemental Wars is a non-collectible fantasy card game. It is played with a deck of 40 cards, 10 for each of the Element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth) with a Strength ranking from 10 to 1. The strongest cards (Strength from 10 to 6) have a Fame score of 11, 10, 4, 3 and 2 points.

The classical version is played in four, with the persons sitting in front of each other forming a team (but in the booklet there are variants for different numbers of players).

Before the game begins, one of the four players shuffles the deck and places it in front of the player to his left who must cut it. The dealer then distributes three cards to each of the four players (either singly or all three at once), in a counterclockwise rotation, beginning with the player on his immediate right.

He then uncovers the thirteenth card and places it prominently in the center of the table. This card, regardless of its rank, identifies the Elemental plane on which the Tournament takes place: the Dominating one. The remaining cards are usually placed, face down, as a stack on top of the Dominating card, but not obscuring it.

The game begins with the player to the dealer's immediate right, and goes around the table until the dealer has played last. Each round of four cards played constitutes a round of tournament. The winner of each rounf gathers all four cards and places them, face down, on his side of the table

The winner of each hand is determined by the Strength and the Element of the cards. The winner is the player that dropped the strongest card of the Element that has been played first on that round; but if somebody played a card of the Dominating element, the winner is the strongest of that element.

The winner of each round then draws one card from the deck. Then the others also draw one card, in sequence. Play continues until all the cards have been played.

At the end of the game the total number of Fame points is added up for each team. As there are 30 points for each Element, the maximum number of points is 120. The winner of the game is the team which scores 61 or more points. The score over 60 is kept to see which team wins the partita (the set) scoring a fixed amount of points.

The cards have to be cut from a booklet that belongs to I giochi del duemila (The games of 2000) collection: a series of role-playing games, game books, wargames, card games and so on that included 23 titles. The name of the collection refers both to the end of the millennium and to the price: 2000 liras, that means 1.03 Euros, making them the cheapest games in Italy.

Marbles are launched into the playing area by use of a simple metal lever. The goal is to will your 7 marbles to land on top of one of several holes, each with a different point value. The game board rests at a slight angle so the marbles will gather near the bottom, in the Brier Patch, if they don't settle on a point value. After all of your marbles have been launched, you tally up your score to compare with others. There is also a ZIP! spot that allows you to relaunch a marble.

The name Zip! was likely incorporated as Uncle Remus was the character who sang the song Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

Unit Scale: Battalion/Regiment

Lost Battles is an operational game covering various Eastern Front battles at battalion - regiment level. These battles are fought on a generic map that represents the types of terrain found on the Eastern Front.

The game has that essay quality of many Dunnigan designs.  It intentionally does not try to be all encompassing but consciously focuses on specific strands of the story as simply and straight forwardly as possible.  Good advice for storytellers and game designers.  While a bit primitive by today's standards Lost Battles is nevertheless complete and playable presenting many interesting problems to be solved.  Though only four scenarios are provided with game, the highly variable victory conditions actually make the game extremely replayable.  The game also provides brief tools to design many scenarios of your own.  In fact you could say that it is this that the game does most best.  It is likely that many early designers played a game or two of this before going their own way taking with them the bits and pieces of the simulacrum that suited them.

Common to all 3 sub-games is, that all 60 cards are evenly dealt to the players, which lay them on the table. The player who can turn all his cards first, is the winner.

As in Memory, players can choose 2 cards to look at, but they can only choose their own cards and the revealed cards must match with the throw of the 2-4 dice (1-2 normal dice and 1-2 colour dice depending on the selected sub-game).

8395,Giganten,1981,6.625,16,2,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Animals Prehistoric ,Secret Unit Deployment,"Giganten could be briefly described as Dinosaur Stratego. Each player has a set of 23 saurians (dinosaurs of various kinds, pterodactyls, pleisosaurs, etc.) which are stand-up cardboard pieces with plain backs, so the opponent cannot tell which piece is which.  Pieces move and attack each other Stratego-fashion, with the goal being to find your opponent's eggs.

There were two versions of the game produced.  The original 1981 version came in a small box, with a larger box coming out in 1982, and had numbers on the pieces to indicate their strength on land and in water (air being a special case).  The larger version won the Essener Feder-prize (prize for the best rules) in 1983. The later (1992) version again came in a much smaller box and did not have numbers on the pieces, instead having a booklet that shows which pieces defeat which others in each kind of terrain (functionally it appears to be similar).  This version also has fewer types of creatures than the first - no crocodile, diplodocus, etc.

In the included booklet of the small edition How came the idea to Giganten, Hubert Pinthus talks from an old, well known game with opponents of unknown strength. It's clear that he meant Stratego and he admitted that Giganten was heavily inspired by Stratego. The change from military units to dinosaurs is a minor change, but there were more important changes: 1 - small edition: added variable terrain (land, swamp, lakes); the lakes in Stratego were not terrain, but mere obstacles. 2 - large edition: added variable board consisting of 4 parts and added 2 more dinosaurs.

The French version of the game was called Dinosaures.

From the Introduction

Welcome to Indiana Jones and the Wrath of Hecate, the game of narrow escapes and rumpled fedoras starring everyone's favorite archeologist.  Wrath is a solitaire game in three parts, designed to be played in a few hours; the player takes the role of Indiana Jones and his sidekick Ko as they attempt to thwart another dastardly Nazi plot to take over the world.

Part One: Secrets Revealed:

GOAL: Indy has entered the cult's tomb in search of a mystic cerimonial dagger.  He must reach the central chamber and grab the dagger, then exit the Temple by moving back to the entrance.

PLAYER: selects path for Indy, rolling 2 dice to determine the number of action points for that turn, and navigates through the maze and various encounters.

Part Two: Chase to the Docks:

GOAL: The Nazis have plans for Hecate and don't want our heroes to spoil the party. Indy and Ko have to reach the Bantu Wind before they get turned into Swiss cheese. The road however, leads down a narrow canyon, so maneuvering options are limited.  To make matters worse, the floor is littered with rocks and other debris, turning an otherwise straight roadway into a deadly slalom.

PLAYER: navigates Indy and Ko's jeep down the canyon avoiding rocks and debris and the Nazis, utilizing action points.  Game uses a moving map to represent the trip (Indy needs to survive the 5 mile trip to the Bantu Wind.

Part Three: By Darkest Moonlight:

GOAL: The ceremony is underway, and Hecate will soon walk the Earth again. It's up to Indy and Ko to stop the ceremony from happening.  To do that they must fulfill two goals: Kill the Priest and rescue the Maiden.

PLAYER: uses Indy and Ko's action points to move around the map of the Temple of Hecate and disrupt the Nazi's reincarnation ceremony.

Each segment is played on a different board using a variety of pieces and straightforward game mechanics.

[NOTE:  Actually, the cover of this issue has a typo.  The cover says Issue 35, but it's actually Issue 36.  Throughout the inside of the magazine, it's listed as #36.  Therefore be careful when buying the magazine for this Indiana Jones game so that you get the issue you're looking for.]

Many extra counters of different types are included, from cavalry to early cannons. Extra hex sheets are included for designing other castles . . . The map sheet provided with the game represents a section of terrain that might be found in central Europe. The castle walls and town on the sheet are of the period 1350-1450 A.D.

There are two additional terrain sheets (overlays): One sheet represents a Roman mile-castle on the Hadrian wall in Britain of about the period 125 A.D. The other sheet represents a Saxon Burh, or fortified hill settlement of about 1050-1150 A.D.

The first edition of the game had un-cut cardstock counters and features not printed on the mapsheet were filled in with colored markers. The second edition has all the colors printed on the mapsheet and die-cut counters.

great conflicts in history. This particular starter set deals with the Western European Theater during World War II. The game consists of a Conflict deck of 50 cards, 47 Arsenal cards for the British forces, and 47 Arsenal cards for the German forces. Based upon the draw of Conflict cards, players may build forces, learn about their opponent, gain a secret advantage, or enter into a battle. The objective is to be the player at the end of the game with the most victory points, or to win the battle for your opponents homeland. In addition, 20-card expansion packs are available to improve the selection and capabilities of Arsenal cards and Conflict cards for this set. Additionally, this set can be combined with the other World War II Starter Sets so you and your friends may play the entire war as you please.

Africa: Desolate, expansive, and inhospitable. Even in the absence of war, its hostile elements threaten the lives of all who trespass upon it. But war is not absent, as hordes of Italian soldiers and tanks take up arms to establish the New Roman Empire for their leader, Mussolini. Standing in their way is the old established British Empire, and the new up and coming power of America. Reaching out for help from their ally Germany, the Afrika Corps is formed to deal with the Army of the Nile which is now reinforced with fresh American blood and equipment. Thus, the see-saw war across a continent ensues. Can Rommel be victorious at El Alamein? Will the Allies take the fortress at Tobruk? Can Operation Torch penetrate the Italian Navy? Will the French navy be an asset to the Allies, or the Axis? Will Patton's forces be defeated at Kasserine Pass? You decide in this Desert War edition of Battlecards: World Conflict.

Units are squads, Heavy Weapon Teams, and individual Leaders, vehicles  guns. During play, players alternate activating formations under their respective leaders, with each activated unit able to take a single action - commonly move, fire or move 1/2 distance plus fire at reduced effect. A variety of other actions common to tactical scale games are possible - break down/assemble Heavy Weapons, entrench, etc.

Infantry Combat is resolved on a CRT, with units being 'Stopped', 'Neutralised' (demoralised), Eliminated or losing a step. Anti-armour combat is resolved by a smaller CRT, using the difference between attack  defence factors such as penetration, armour, terrain, movement, range, etc.

Morale is measured per formation, with reduced efficiency (-1 to all actions, and must roll to activate at all) or even Rout possible after a certain number of losses.

These clever explanation/context/twists are where the fun starts.  The player will now have to turn that unreasonable sentence into a reasonable one by describing some impossible situation where this particular sentence would make sense. After the explanation others have to vote if the explanation is reasonable enough for the interpreter to get points.

There are a couple of variations to the game, like playing a blind card, and certain actions allowing a player to place a card leaving a gap in between the sentence (in general, more difficult to fill than the usual sequence)

A tactical simulation of the Battle for San Juan Hill, fought on July 1, 1898 during the Spanish-American War. It was the largest land battle fought during the war, and the American victory would propel Teddy Roosevelt towards the White House. The battle was not as one-sided as most Americans think, as Spanish troops fought with bravery and grim determination, and inflicted 3 times their own casualties on the American forces.

The basic units in the game are regiments of infantry and dismounted cavalry for the Americans, companies and battalions for the Spanish, and batteries of artillery for both sides. 
The scale is 125 yards per hex, with 45 minutes per turn, and roughly 60 to 75 men per strength point.

Ranged fire, assaults, morale, leader casualties, step reduction, Gatling Guns, sharpshooters, the observation balloon, journalists, trenches, and the Sims-Dudley dynamite gun are all covered. Two scenarios, one covering the historical fight and one a what-if. Solitaire rules included.

The game simulates the Confederate counterattack on Fort Donelson after the Fort had been invested by U.S. Grant and the Union army in February 1862. The Confederate garrison actually outnumbered the Union troops 18,000 to 15,000, but Grant's judgement of his opponent's psychology served him well. The unconditional surrender of the fort on Febuary 16th, 1862, shattered the Confederate defenses in western and middle Tennessee.The equivalent of an entire corps was taken prisoner, and the Cumberland River was opened to the Union Navy. Within weeks Nashville would fall and the remaining Confederate forces would retreat into Mississippi. The victory made a national hero of it's previously unknown author, who here began his rise to command of all the Union armies - U.S. Grant. Yet the battle could have turned out much differently, and the controversy in later years over what really happened and why would be among the most intense surrounding any action of the war.

8462,Main Event Wrestling,1998,5.9375,8,2.6667,2,2,60,60,,Humor Sports ,,"Main Event Wrestling is mainly a card game that simulates the action at a professional wrestling match.  Players maintain a hand of seven cards that when played, allow them to make attacks on their opponents or to defend against such maneuvers.

Each turn, players play rock-scissors-paper (called strike-kick-grab in this game) to establish who has the right to attack (momentum).  Cards are played, with titles straight from pro wrestling moves (Figure Four Leg Lock, Atomic Drops) and quips (Did you see that?!).  The cards have different costs and effects, adjusting the wrestler's fatigue markers as the fighters stun, knock down, and try to pin each other.  Some allow the wrestlers to seize the momentum and attack.  When the players have played all the cards they want, they determine the injuries inflicted onto their wrestlers and refill their hand of cards.  When the deck has ran out of cards, the cards that have been played are reshuffled to form a new deck.

The game ends when a player wins the match by having their opponent's wrestler pinned, knocked out, or disqualified.  The game also ends when the card deck has been reshuffled as many times as the number of players in the game.

8489,Sack Armies,2001,6.55882,17,2,2,6,60,60,Wargames,Collectible Components Fantasy Wargame ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenSecret Unit DeploymentTile PlacementTrading,"A collectible game with hexagonal tiles. Two or more generals move their armies against each other. 
To do that each player must build his deck but the strength of a players' deck is limited by a total rating of each tiles' power. Tiles can be units, spells, maneuvers or battlefields. The tiles are drawn randomly and can be used afterwards in the players turn. Like in Magic a turn consists of different phases. The number of actions per turn is limited as well.
The game is won if a player can't perform an action or loses all his battlegrounds.

The collective aspect of the game is not too strong because only one additional release of tiles were made so far. But the players' decks are nicely balanced because the game limits the total strength of a deck. So tactic and a good hand in drawing tiles is more important than spending money on tiles.

Upon one side were the Goblins and the wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves.

The game is a classical wargame. The rules are quite simple: on one side there are Men, Dwarves and Elves trying to defend the gates and the slopes of the Lonely Mountain. The Free People are few but can use the advantage of the terrain (mountains and rivers). The game is played in turns (12): the Free People must defend the gates and try to survive the dark hordes.

Each units has a movement value and a combat value (attack and defence); the combat value of the defender can be modified by the terrain. The leaders (King of Orcs for the goblins; Wizard, Dwarven Hero and the kings of Elves, Man and Dwarves for the Free People) are really strong in supporting the troups and could really change the odds of the battles.

The goblins could also win the game killing all the troops and leaders of one of the Free People army (Elves, Dwarves or Men).

Close to the end, the Eagles and the Bear-Man come to help the Free People.

8493,Anagramania,2003,5.46667,15,1,2,6,45,45,,Educational Memory Puzzle Word Game ,MemoryPaper-and-PencilPoint to Point MovementSimultaneous Action Selection,"Anagramania is an anagram-based board game for 2 to 6 players. Unlike typical anagram word puzzles, the clues in Anagramania are not just the word or words from which the answer is derived. Instead, Anagramania clues actually provide a hint or definition of the correct solution. Here's an example:

Sam rang a friend to find out why the letters he wrote were so confused!

The object is to re-arrange all the letters of the keywords (Sam rang a) - which are shown in bold italics on the actual clue cards - to form a single word that solves the clue. The answer is of course anagrams.
 For each game, every player has an 11 x 4 'throw away' clue sheet containing twenty clues like the one above. There are 24 sets of six clue sheets in each game pack. That's enough for six players to play 24 separate games.

During game play, players conceal their clue sheets in special 'pockets' that allow them to see only one new clue at a time. In most board games players have to await their turn, which can be quite irritating if each player requires several minutes for his or her turn. That's not the case in Anagramania. In each turn, all players compete simultaneously to solve the same clue. No time limit is set at the start of the turn, but once any one player claims to have the answer (and has written it down) other players have just one minute more to complete their efforts to find the answer (timed by a sand timer).
 By solving clues, players move pawns on a 14 x 14 play board. A correct answer earns forward progress - two squares for the first person who answered, one square for others. For a wrong answer, the player moves his/her pawn back a square; and for no answer, the pawn is left in its current position. The winner is the first player to reach the center circle on the board, with a typical game lasting about 45 minutes. The simultaneous method of play makes the game very exciting, and leaves no time for any player to get bored!

Should your piece enter one of the transporters, it comes out the other (color coordinated) crystal in any of the 8 directions you choose.

8516,The Second Boer War,2001,6.61053,19,2.25,2,2,180,180,Wargames,Post-Napoleonic Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Boer War is an operational level simulation of the Second Boer War(1899-1902), fought between the forces of the British Empire and the Boer republics of South Africa.

The game map portrays southern Africa as it was at the end of the Nineteenth Century. Counters represent the military forces that took part in the conflict, including headquarters, logistics as well as combat units. Relatively low unit density requires a key-point defense strategy for both sides and protection of supply lines which the Boers were initially able to raid with impunity.

Scenarios, Design Notes, Experimental Rules and Errata were printed in issue 214.

The Belisarius rules are based on the Charlemagne (ST #189) and Xenophon (ST #203) games. The system was later used in Khan (ST #229).

Hours of sunshine for a rainy day

Early peoples in every part of the world harvested from riverbanks, oceans, fields and forests, what brought them life and happiness.  Games were fashioned from everything imaginable, often from the same objects that brought them food.

Wherever people have organized socially, whether in bands, tribes, nation or nations, they have usually sought to develop knowledge, tools, and resources, in order to increase the harvest and standard of living for all, from one generation to the next.

Chief Surprise uses the symbols for wealth, and the tools of implement, rewarding each when correctly applied.

The Blue Challenge  maneuver the King to safety past Ivory's forces.  The Ivory Mission  foil blue's plans by surrounding the King on four sides, preventing his escape.  It's anyone's game until the last move!

One of the simplest, yet most challenging games ever developed, BREAK AWAY is also one of the oldest.  The game was already being played in Scandinavia well before 400 A.D. where it was called tafl (pronounced tab-l), from the Latin word tabula, meaning board game.  As new games were introduced, the name was modified to hnefatafl to distinguish it from other board games.  The Norsemen carried the game to Iceland, Britain and Ireland  from whence it spread to Wales.  In Britain it was the only game played by the Saxons until the Norman conquest.  By the twelfth century, however, the game had been largely eclipsed by chess, although evidence shows it enjoyed a following in Wales well into the sixteenth century.  The Lapps of northern Sweden named it tablut and played it into the eighteenth century.  In their version, the king and his defenders were Swedes, while the invaders were the oppressive Muscovites.  It is from this incarnation that BREAK AWAY has been developed as a modern game of classic strategic objectives.

This game was published as part of the Hi-Q collection

8543,Check,2003,7.0625,8,0,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Bluffing Card Game Fighting ,Co-operative PlayPattern BuildingPattern RecognitionRock-Paper-ScissorsTile PlacementTrading,"Check - The Chess Card Game is an original card game which takes the classic Chess concept and packages it up in an original deck of 64 full-colour playing cards. There are sixteen cards in each of the four traditional suits: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. The goal is the same as Chess, to take the opponent's King, but gameplay is truly unique.

Each player plays with the cards of one suit, which evens the playing field substantially over many card games which are based principally on the luck of the draw. Each card in the deck has a numerical attack strength and an attack pattern which will be familiar to Chess players. However, unlike Chess, the eight Pawn cards have different attack strengths. The number one pawn is called the Ace and can be used in special attacks.

The game combines mainly strategic thinking with an element of luck, and some bluffing. In most turns, one card is taken from each player. Formulating an attack which takes more than one card, or a defence where no cards are lost, is a key strategic element of the game.

There are four game modes for 2, 3 and 4 players, plus a collaborative Alliance mode where two pairs team up against each other.

Unlike some other Chess variants which use cards to modify the traditional game of Chess, Check is a stand-alone card game. No board is required to play.

8546,More Battle for China,2001,8.3125,8,3,2,3,180,180,Wargames,Expansion for Base-game Wargame World War II ,Area MovementSimulation,"More Battle for China is an expansion set for Battle for China, a simulation game on the War of Resistance Against Japan, produced by the Microgame Design Group in 1999. The original game covered the period from 1937 to 1941. This expansion kit covers the period from 1942 to 1945, completing the Pacific War, and on into the 1945-49 Civil War period.

There are three scenarios in this expansion set:

Pacific War (1942-45): The Pacific War scenario can be played on its own or as an extension of the Basic game. In this scenario, the Chinese player will control all KMT, CCP, Western Allies, and Soviet units. The Japanese player will control all IJA and puppet troops units. Optionally, there may be a third player who controls all CCP units.

Civil War (1946-49): For two players. The board has been cleared of foreign invaders; now begins the fight to determine who will rule the Chinese people.

Campaign Game(1937-49). For two or three players. Play begins in mid-1937 with the Basic Game, continues on until the Japanese surrender in China, and thence to the end of the resumed civil war between the Nationalists and Communists.

There are two 8.5 x 11 half-maps extending the original map north to Siberia and south to India. 140 additional counters add more Communist Chinese, extra Japanese, Western Allied and Soviet units.

The expansion kit was once made by the Microgame Design Group, which is now defunct. The components of the kit are now made available as a free download by the game's designer.

June 2009: The expansion kit has been included in Battle for China Deluxe, a special edition of the game by Fiery Dragon Productions. The package includes:

- 44-page integrated rulebook for all three games, with coil binding
- two red dice
- 12 cards for the various charts and tables for the three games
- 5 sheets of counters, for a total of 480 counters - consisting of the three sheets for the original game, and two new ones for the expansion. Counters might still be a bit thin for some tastes (but then they would not fit in the box) but the diecutting is good.
- 3 maps, the original 11x17 central map plus the north and south 8x11 extensions (Siberia-Manchuria and Siam-Burma-India, respectively). The North map matches up well and obviously. For the South map the area north of Burma-1 is Burma-3, and the area north of Burma-2 is Burma-4. The unnamed area north of India-8 is Nepal and is impassable.

This was the last version of Battle for China to appear before the Decision Games edition of the basic 1937-41 game in late 2009. Production of the deluxe version is limited, fewer than 125 copies I believe.

When the Decision Games edition appears, the designer will post an updated and integrated set of rules and charts here, along with homemade redrawn extension maps to fit the larger 22x34 map. The counter sheets provided here do not need to be changed, but be advised that the counters in the Decision Games edition have been changed to iconic style, with a different format.

With the plays determined, the cover is removed, the shift card revealed and the path of the play is compared to the defensive positions. Where the path crosses a triangle is where the ball is downed. A touchdown is scored when a play is not downed on the field. Players are also attempting to make ten yards in four downs, as in football, to earn a first down.

Random events include a roll every play to see if there is a penalty, and dice-rolling punting, kick off and field goal rules.

After four quarters of fifteen plays each, the winner is the player with the most points.

The board, consisting of an outer ring of stores and other spaces, and an inner ring with all the rooms of your house. Cards representing each project are drawn. Each card has a list of supplies and tools you need for the job, and what stores to buy them from. Players then travel around the outer ring buying the things they need, and marking them off of the project cards. When the player has one or more project cards filled they can move into the inner ring and go to the room the project is for. A rating card is drawn (1-4) and a description of the project is read. The back of the project card contains four different outcomes for the project ranging from spectacular to horrible, these match the rating card and instruct the player what benefit they get from their project. Each project can add equity to your house. The first player to increase the equity of their house by $50,000 wins the game.

To get rid of your cards you must first meet the goal of the round, which is to play a particular number of pure or mixed words (made up of letters of one color entirely or a combination of colors, respectively) as determined by a set of included cards.

Once a player has made their first goal, they can then get rid of their remaining cards by changing their own words or those of their opponents, by inserting letters, covering letters, or adding prefixes or suffixes.  First person to get rid of their entire hand wins the round and scores the points for every card remaining in his/her opponents' hands.  Highest score after ten rounds is the winner.

Game Idea
Tame me, said the fox to the Little Prince. What is tame?, the Little Prince asked? To Tame means to make themselves familiar, to establish ties, answered the fox. Completely in the sense of Saint Exuperys' poetic world of thought the participants make themselves familiar with each other in this game. Can you guess the secret desires of your fellow players? Did you see the fantasy behind the obvious things? Can you draw the favorite hiding place of your childhood? By the fulfillment of the different tasks the Little Prince travels from Planet to Planet and as reward the players may set stars in the sky. When a player fails at their task, the fox moves farther away towards his home.

Goal of the Game
If the Little Prince and the fox meet on the earth, the players succeed, and the winner is the player who could bring the most stars to the sky. On the other hand, if the Little Prince does not reach the fox, because it disappeared into its home, all players lose, since they failed to tame the fox.

This is THE LAST HURRAH - the sixth ASL module. The eight scenarios contained herein focus on historical situations involving the early German blitzkriegs of World War II and the many nationalities that fought against the invaders. Paratroopers, armor, air power, audacity and courage were the tools with which Germany planned to overrun the neutral nations of Europe.  and in less than two years, in actions as far apart as Norway and Crete, the German military accomplished all they had set out to do.  
For the most part, the invaded neutrals (Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Greece) were defended by hastily-mobilized reservists stiffened by a few elite units.  The actions depicted in THE LAST HURRAH will challenge veteran ASL players to match the tenacity, audacity and victories on both sides in eight scenarios, recreating the German march of conquest.  Experience - as only ASL can let you - the desperate fighting of these first days of World War II.  Whether commanding German armor, Polish cavalry, Greek infantry, Belgian Chasseurs, Norwegian reservists or Luftwaffe paratroopers, if you're an ASL grognard, you're bound to find something pleasing in the wide spectrum of scenarios included in THE LAST HURRAH.   There is even a scenario pitting those age-old foes, the Poles and the Russians!

THE LAST HURRAH contains eight scenarios, one countersheet of Allied Minor infantry and support weapons - and two boards: 11, with revised artwork; and 33, which features open terrain and a large grainfield.  
ASL, BEYOND VALOR  and YANKS (for two scenarios) are needed to play these scenarios.

This is WEST OF ALAMEIN the long-awaited British addition to the ASL system. As the title implies, it focuses on battles between the British 8th Army and Deutsches Afrika Korps in the North African desert in 1941-43.

WEST OF ALAMEIN contains the entire British order of battle, including all U.S. Lend-Lease vehicles, ordnance and support weapons, thus enabling you to command every major vehicle, gun and troop type used by British and/or Commonwealth forces in every theater throughout the war.

Also contained herein is Chapter F of the ASL rules, which covers the terrain types encountered in the desert and other arid regions: scrub, wadis, hillocks, escarpments, soft sand, dunes, deirs and hammada. Chapter F also provides rules for the special climatic conditions that were so much a part of desert combat, such as dust, heat haze and sun blindness.

Of the five mounted mapboards in WEST OF ALAMEIN, four (#s 26-29) depict flat open desert, with the dominant terrain features on separate, moveable overlays so as to maximize flexibility. The fifth board (#25) represents a rugged hill mass as is found in Tunisia, and can be converted to a large escarpment by means of an overlay specially designed for this purpose.

A Design-Your-Own system for the random selection and placement of overlays is also provided, which in combination with the vehicle and weapon point values, historical notes and DYO charts, will provide an endless variety of situations for those who enjoy creating their own scenarios. And as if all this werent enough, simple rules have been included to enable the desert boards and overlays to represent the steppes of the Ukraine, providing added flexibility for these components. Of the eight scenarios enclosed, four can be played using the ASL rules and BEYOND VALOR; the other four also require rules, counters and/or a board from YANKS. No other boards or modules are needed.

WEST OF ALAMEIN is not a complete game. Ownership of ASL and BEYOND VALOR is required as is YANKS for four scenarios.

CODE OF BUSHIDO, the Japanese ASL module.  Eagerly anticipated for years, the Japanese finally make their debut in wargaming's premier system of WWII tactical ground combat.

Inside you will find the complete ASL order of battle for the Japanese:  all the significant vehicles, guns and troop types they employed from the 1930s through 1945.  Eight scenarios, whose settings range from the barren plains of Manchuria to the steaming jungles of New Guinea, pit the Japanese against a wide variety of Allied nationalities.   
Also included are four new mapboards (#s 34-37), fully compatible with the other SL/ASL boards, which depict the dense vegetation so common in tropical areas.  Four sheets of overlays (village, stream, wooded hill, rice paddies, etc.) provide the means to create an almost endless variety of new terrain configurations.  
Chapter G of the ASL rules covers the many unique characteristics of the Japanese as well as new terrain types like jungle, bamboo, huts, swamp and kunai grass, among others.

Fanatical soldiers who will die rather than break and run - unwavering, seemingly unstoppable banzai charges - individual tank-hunter infantrymen willing to blow themselves up along with an enemy AFV - these are but a hint of what is offered in this most unique addition to the ASL system.  Your first CODE OF BUSHIDO scenario will be an ASL experience like none before - and one you'll likely never forget.

This is HOLLOW LEGIONS - the long-awaited Italian ASL module.  Here is the complete order of battle for a new nationality - one never before offered in the long history of the SL/ASL systems.  The Italian soldier of the Second World War has been much maligned - but is this view totally justified?  How much was his performance affected by the quality of his weapons and the abilities of his small-unit leaders?  Playing HOLLOW LEGIONS, which incorporates the results of extensive research on this lesser-known army and its equipment, will allow you to form your own opinion by giving you the opportunity to command every major vehicle, gun and troop type employed by the Italians in North and East Africa, Russian, Sicily, the Balkans and Italy during World War II.
  
The two mapboards (#s 30 and 31) contained herein depict open desert; added to those in WEST OF ALAMEIN, they allow you to re-create North African battles of even greater expanse than was possible with just the British module.  But HOLLOW LEGIONS is certainly not limited to the desert; indeed, of the eight scenarios in this module, five are set in Europe.  
Also included are the ASL Chapter H (Design Your Own) Italian vehicle and weapon listings, point values, historical notes and DYO charts - plus the ASL Chapter N (Armory) pages for the countersheets in HOLLOW LEGIONS, those for the Allied and Axis Minor infantry and support weapons, and those for British ordnance and transport.

You've fought on the Eastern and Western fronts, in the Mediterranean and North African theaters, on the plains of Manchuria and in the jungles of Burma and New Guinea.  You've experienced paradrops, glider-borne landings, Stuka attacks and opposed river crossings. Only one major type of WW2 land combat remains unexplored:   the classic amphibious assault. Now, in GUNG HO!, this too is added to the combat repertoire of ASL. And what better way to present assault landings than with the introduction of the U.S.Marines. GUNG HO! offers four types of U.S.M.C. squads, reflecting their evolution through the war years, along with the most comprehensive tactical-level amphibious assault rules ever offered in a wargame.

The scenarios present different sections of the historical battle in the usual ASL format.

The heart of Red Barricades are the campaign games. Rather than linking the scenarios, the campaign games consist of campaign days where players fight for control of the factories and surrounding buildings. Between these campaign days, players consolidate their positions, purchase reinforcements and get ready to continue the fight. The three campaign games cover the first few days of the German assault, the last days of the Soviet defense, or the full 30 days of the German push to take the area.

Two historically accurate map sheets, new rules on terrain around Stalingrad (debris, railway embankments, storage tanks, etc), and new weapons such as Russian Molotov Projector are included.  This module requires ASL and Beyond Valor to play.

Landing a pawn exactly on one of four points on the track allows the player to hop that pawn along those four points, for a large shortcut.  Also, should the player roll a one, the pawn can move into the center for an even greater shortcut, since that pawn may exit to the final shortcut point before its home.  A pawn occupying a space to which an opponent's pawn is moving becomes aggravated and sent back to base.  Unlike Pachisi, there is no opportunity to form blockades for safety of the pawns and obstruction of the path.

On each turn, a player matches a card from his hand to the top card of the discard pile in either the number or the color. This card is placed on the discard pile. If unable to make a match, the player has to take a card from the draw pile. Countdown cards signal a frantic attempt to be the first to match the number that is counted down from ten.

Equipment consists of a clear plastic grid covered by square cards numbered from 1-30, an assortment of cards that fit under the grid (containing all 26 letters of the alphabet and four blanks) randomly organized, and 32 tall letter cards the size of four squares on the grid. The game consists of two parts.

First Part:
One of the alphabet cards is placed under the grid so that none of the players can see it. Players start by picking a number on the grid. The card is removed and all players see the letter underneath. This letter is written down and the number card replaced. The player then chooses another number revealing another letter in the same way. The letters revealed are written in the order they are revealed and must have the possibility of making a word. If a word is possible the player may continue to choose numbers and revealing letters. If a complete word is formed the player gets ten points per letter added to their score and may start over trying to make another word. If a blank or a letter that can not be used in the word is revealed then that players turn is over and the next player takes their turn in the same way. The front game ends once a player scores 150 points.

Second Part:
One of the losing players forms a secret six-letter word using the letter cards placed on a special sheet, and this word is placed under the grid. The winning player from the first part chooses five numbers, which are removed to reveal one-quarter of one letter. The player tries to guess the secret word to win $1,000; if the player fails, s/he selects another number to reveal and $100 is deducted from the prize. This continues until the player either guesses the word or the jackpot goes down to $100.

The game is played in three rounds, with the player or team with the most money being the winner.

8701,Power Quest,1987,0,0,0,1,4,90,90,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,PartnershipsRoll / Spin and Move,"Power Quest is an elaborate roll-and-move game with mechanics that will be very familiar to nearly everyone. There are elements here from backgammon, pachisi, Careers, you name it.

The vague back story has players controlling agents that move about the board ...in your struggle against the odds to obtain money, prisoners, and position.

The square gameboard is printed with four concentric rings of spaces.  Each turn players roll two dice to move one of their three tokens - pardon me, agents - out of their headquarters on the outer ring and around the board.  Agents can be sent back to HQ by enemy agents, can form blockades, can fall into traps and be captured, and in general are used to make money and harass the other agents.

Most squares are marked with actions that kick off when agents land on them.  Many of these earn money for the players, either as a flat payment or by allowing a simple form of gambling involving the bank and the other players.  Other actions include: allowing movement up to the next inner track, drawing Fate cards that dole out random goodness and badness, starting an auction that sells fallen agents to the highest bidders, and traps that may be inconveniently activated by other players.

The rings get progressively more generous and dangerous as agents move to the inside.  Agents captured by an opponent's action (rather than a game mechanic) don't re-enter the game, so the number of agents in play gradually diminishes.  The game ends when only one player's agents are left on the board.  Players sell (ransom, I suppose) their captured prisoners, and the most money wins the game.

This appears to be a limited run home brew, but it comes in a sturdy box and the production values are good.  Both the Regular Play and Advanced Play rules booklets are well-organized and pretty clear.  Advanced rules include solitaire, partnership and a host of other variants.

If a tree is potentially in the line-of-sight, the player peers through a miniature periscope placed on the battlefield; if at least 50% of the enemy model is visible, then the unit may fire. Combat is resolved with a single six-sided die roll that is cross-referenced on a Hit Chart, that takes into account the statistics of both the offensive and defensive units.

8783,European Theater of Operations,2003,6.89,10,3,1,6,90,90,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Area MovementDice RollingSimulation,"NEPPAGames: European Theater of Operations or ETO is a World War II Game of Grand Strategy Created by NEPPAGames.  Do not mix it up with another game by the same name from TSR/ SPI or the latter Decision Games.

NEPPAGames: ETO's historical simulation of the European Theater during World War II provides the framework where players are free to pursue their own strategic course of action. Each action has both short term and long term economic and military consequences. How players react to these consequences in relation to their own strategy will ultimately decide their fate.

Six different games (three Campaigns and three Scenarios) are available right out of the box, allowing players to select a game based upon their interests and available time. Game turns are seasonal, each representing a three month period. The map board, hard-mounted, depicts the WWII battlegrounds of Europe from France to Russia, and from Norway to North Africa to the Middle East.

While the interaction of all the different aspects of NEPPAGames: ETO is complex, the game is designed with simplicity and maximum playability in mind. On an Avalon Hill complexity rating, ETO's complexity would be about 7.

NEPPAGames: ETO uses a zone-based area movement system for ground and air units. The use of a zone or area-based mapboard significantly increases playability. Since each hex covers less ground than a zone or area, hexed base games require more playing pieces.  More playing pieces require more time to move them around, which is what the game wanted to avoid in the first place.  The mapboard measures approximately 2ft x 3ft (or 24x36).

Stacking limits are imposed. Terrain effects on combat are considered. Terrain and map features include mountains, swamps, beaches, fortresses,overwater crossings, ports (both beach and coastal), capital cities, special Russian defense and factory zones, oil, and more. Warfare Production Points or WPP's (Pronounced whips) are the currency of NEPPAGames: ETO. WPPs pay for everything from Declarations of War to Unit Construction.  Something that is similar in concept of Building Resources Points (BRPs) in Third Reich, The Rise and Fall of from Avalon Hill.

Represented in NEPPAGames: ETO are the forces of Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Russia, the United States, the Axis Minor Allies, and the armies of almost all neutral countries are depicted in the game. Each country's army is unique, with a fixed force pool of various unit types which are either available at start or available but unbuilt. Additional units may become available at historically appropriate times. Units include infantry, artillery, armor, air, naval, airborne, and U-boats. Each unit has different capabilities and differing attack and defense values. The units that will come with the game will be cardboard counters.

Ground combat features both normal combat and armored breakthrough and exploitation. Air units within range of a battle can lend their weight both on the attack and in defense. Air superiority is most often a requirement for success on the battlefield. Attacks can be made in the face of a heavy defense, but success is not guaranteed, and often, a heavy price must be paid.

Naval units are required for amphibious invasion, transport, shipping of troops and currency, shore bombardment, and strategic warfare. German U-boats can launch attacks against the steady stream of incoming convoys bound for Britain or attempt to sever the Murmansk convoy routes. As time passes, Allied ASW forces gain in both numbers and effectiveness.

NEPPAGames: ETO will have you engaged in a titanic clash between Allied and Axis forces on old and perhaps new battlefields of WWII. The outcome is up to you.

The design goal was to combine the best elements of several existing board games (including but not limited to Axis and Allies, Third Reich, Advanced Third Reich, General Patton, etc) into a very playable, very historical package. The game will have appeal to several categories of gamers:

1) Current Axis and Allies players looking for more historical and less ahistorical play (i.e. the stack),
2) Former Avalon Hill gamers who enjoyed the historical accuracy and gameplay but wished for less complexity and more playability, and
3) New gamers wanting to play a great new WWII strategy game.

Game components include:
2ft x 3ft Beautifully Rendered Mounted Map Board
20 page Game Manual
8 page Campaign and Scenario Booklet that includes six different games you can play right out of the box

The game simulates tops battling in an arena.  There are two different levels of play, one for young children and a more advanced game for those who want more depth.

Each player starts by taking one Blade card and placing it face up in front of him/her. Each Blade has its own spin strength. You count that number of cards from the top of your deck and place them face down in a spin pile under the Blade card. The spin pile is very important, since the object of the game is to run your opponent out of spin by removing all the cards in his/her spin pile.

Players take turns initiating battles which go back and forth until one player cannot make a play.  Then players determine how many cards will be lost from the losing player's spin pile using symbols that match up on the tops of the cards.  The advanced version uses card text to take the game to a deeper level.

VP can be gained by holding VP hexes on the western front (on the map, vs. the western allies), and through rolls simulating developments on the eastern front (vs. Russia). The gamer sets up, moves, and conducts the German offensives as he chooses. The game system handles the allies, who are generally on the defensive. Specific rules will instruct allied units about when/where to attack, how to retreat if a retreat occurs, and general movement directions. The game lasts a total of five turns, representing mid-August to early September, 1914, the most fluid period in the west during the Great War.

8794,Legacy of Glory,1990,6,11,3,1,10,360,360,Wargames,Miniatures Napoleonic Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemSimultaneous Action Selection,"Legacy of Glory is a set of rules for fighting tactical Napoleonic battles. The preferred figure scale is 1:60 and the ground scale is 1 = 50 meters. Play is divided into 2-hour Grand Battle Turns, with each Grand Battle Turn subdivided into six tactical turns. Players normally take the role of army and corps commanders, and receive a variable number of command points each Grand Battle Turn, the actual number being determined by the talent rating of the historical general they're representing and the roll of two 10-sided dice. Commanders issue orders to the units under them, with each order requiring a different number of command points. Once an order is issued, there's some delay before it can be executed. The minimum delay depends on distance between the commander issuing the order and the most distant unit affected by it, and there's a variable number of tactical turns of additional delay, dependent on the quality of the generals involved and the roll of two ten-sided dice, before the order actually gets carried out. The smallest units on the board are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, but orders are issued only down to division (or elite brigade level).

Actions within a tactical turn are divided up into multiple phases, most of which are skipped in any particular turn because they don't apply (e.g., the infantry combat resolution phase is skipped if no infantry units are in melee this tactical turn). The designers state in the foreword that one of their objectives is that experienced players should be able to run wall-clock time and game time just about in synch--that is, a Grand Battle Turn should not take more than 2 hours to play, even at the hottest point in the battle.

The original rules came in a bookcase-sized box, and included a rulebook (with rating charts for units and generals, by nationality), three pages of combat charts, three sheets of thin board status markers, and a pair of different-colored 10-sided dice. An updated set of rules was supposed to be issued in 2000-2001, but appears to have fallen by the wayside. Some play test versions of the updated rules do exist.

These are NOT simple rules. They require a fair amount of knowledge of the Napoleonic period to play, since they reward historical formations and tactics and penalize certain forms of rule-lawyering. The ground scale requires a fair amount of playing area, enough that most historical battles could only be put on by a gaming club or run as a convention event.

Produced by the Westinghouse Labs Weapons Division (I think), possibly as a sales or training aid, I have been unable to find any reference to it anywhere, either via Westinghouse or anywhere on the net.

A simple two-player board, card and dice game of force building and maintenance set during the Cold War.

Each turn each player (Red and Blue) must use his budget to buy new combat units (air, land or naval) or support units (bases, repair depots, etc) and maintain his existing units.

Each unit is rated for combat effectiveness, MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) and Cost. Generally, Blue units are more reliable and have a higher combat effectiveness but cost more and take longer to repair. When a unit does break down the player can then use any of his support units to try to repair them.

Each turn a card is flipped to represent the political action for that turn. A crisis requires a minimum force level of a certain type (land, sea or air) to avoid a prestige penalty. A Showdown occurs just once and ends the game - the player with the highest amount of ready force wins the game.

The game is thus a trade off between keeping sufficient force level to win the Crises and sufficient force mix to win the final Showdown.

An old pirate has hidden three treasures on an island. In this 2-player deduction game for children, one player is a treasure hunter trying to find the treasures while the other player gives hints on where the treasures are hidden. Afterwards, the players change roles.

Goal
Earning the most points by correctly locating the treasures while needing as few hints as possible.

Game play
The game board shows an island with 15 connected circles. These are the potential hiding places for the treasures. Each circle is identified through a symbol and also shows one, two or three dots. There are also 15 cardboard discs corresponding to the hiding places (same symbol). The discs have a hole in them.
One player starts the game as the first treasure hunter. He/she gets the 3 red markers and tries to find the three treasures.
The other player shuffles the discs, draws three of them and looks at them, without letting the treasure hunter see them. These discs specify the locations where the treasures are. The other discs form a face-down stack.
The treasure hunter then takes the first disc from the stack and places it on the corresponding location on the board. His/her opponent checks how many treasures are adjacent to that location and marks this by rotating the tile in such a way that the hole shows the same number as dots as there are treasures on adjacent spaces. This is repeated until the treasure hunters thinks he/she knows where the three treasures are. He/she marks the suspected locations with the red markers. Then the actual locations of the treasures are revealed. The treasure hunter gets positive points for location discs not used, and minus points for incorrectly marked locations.

Then the players switch roles.

The game ends after 6 rounds. The player with the most points wins the game.

Players secretly select one of their card corners and the cards are held back to back with numbers showing through the holes.  The value of each card is determined by the lowest number showing through one of its holes; the highest-valued wins.  Ties use the next lowest number, etc.  This is the 'quick play' game.

The more complex game involves each player selecting five different cards (the two players could each use the same card, but no player may play with duplicates).  Players select cards secretly and compare them as in the quick play game.  The losing card is withdrawn (to be replaced by a new card in the next round) and the winner scores the value difference.  Quick plays continue until one player runs out of card or concedes and the winner is determined according to accumulated score.

Additional rules exist for using the cards as a convention-wide game in which players attempt to accumulate cards originally belonging to as many players as possible through trading and quick play victories.  (See the web site if you want to run this at a convention.)

The initial set of 20 Punch Cards uses artwork from Dave Dorman's Wasted Lands series.

8906,Licht und Schatten,1990,6.83333,9,0,2,4,45,45,,Dice Word Game ,Dice RollingModular BoardPartnerships,"Theme: The game has a fairy tale background story in which the young queen of the prosperous and happy Sonnenland (Sunvale in the English description) was flattered and seduced by her shadow via her dreams to tear apart her necklace of sun pearls. As she did so, the shadow became independent and ruled over the land, drainig life and colors from it. An old bard's song tells her that she needs to cross the country, aided by some companions (the players). So, it is a heroic prophesy fairy tale of saving a cursed land.

Goal: The game is semi - co - operative as the players share the goal of moving the queen from one corner of the board to the opposite corner. And all players lose if the shadow lands on the same tile as any other piece or if a player can't pay sun pearls when required by the game. However, players can give each other pearls at any time If the queen reaches the corner, all players are considered winners, but the player with the most pearls is considered the most successful.

Gameplay: The game is played on a modular board made up of 5 x 5 tiles which are turned upside down and upside up during play. Players take turns. During a turn, two special dice are thrown to determine the movement of pieces on the board: depending on the result, either the player moves their figure and the shadow in opposing directions or the players get a chance to move the queen one tile towards the goal. In order to move the queen, players draw a task card asking them for some kind of word (e.g. name a tool) the letters of which are restricted by the current state of the tiles on the board using an hour glass as a time limit. The task cards come in three levels of difficulty.

The game has a strong element of luck as an unfortunate die roll can easily cause the players to lose with no means of direct protection against it. Player decision/influence is limited to the word game and deciding the path the queen figure takes (although that is also restricted so as to forbid detours).

Important: While the game comes with a 4 - language rules booklet, the task cards are monolingual in German, so at least one person needs to be able to understand that language. In addition, the background story is simplified in the translations and the element of the player with the most sun pearls at the end of the game being the most successful is missing.

The most appealing elements of the game are the little plastic mules, jeeps and storage crates that are required for the journey. Mules  jeeps are needed for movement; stores are used to sustain the expedition. Additional components include the game board, a sales price indicator, money and a deck of 52 cards.

Players start with a sum of money and four cards. On his turn, the player must first pay his expenses either with cash or by expending a store. He then plays one (sometimes two) cards and follows the instructions. An 'Authority to Buy' card permits the purchase of one type of commodity (mules/jeeps/stores); the price of these items starts low but steadily increases with demand. Award cards give the player free commodities or allow cheap purchases from a rival. The most common cards, however, are the Camp cards. These are numbered from one to twelve, and playing an appropriate Camp card and transport item allows advancement within the same or subsequent group of camps on the board. If the player has a jeep, he can advance to two camps that turn provided he has two suitable Camp cards available. Money is earned upon reaching a new camp, and the turn is completed by drawing back up to four cards. By moving onto an already-occupied camp, you become the 'guest' of that player which forces him to pay for your upkeep as well as his own until one of you moves away. The winner is the first person to arrive at camp twelve.

Players have to move around a multi-path board by the throw of a die landing on jackpot spaces and collecting 'gold coins' (at least 22 of them....) before they attempt to cross one of several finish spaces with their bounty in tow. Unfortunately, once you have coins, you become a target (when you land on another player, you get their gold).
Each player has five plastic 'blocker cubes' that he can place on empty spaces. These blocks stop everyone but that player from continuing along a particular path.
Besides the spaces where gold is available, there are those one can land on to switch places with the player of your choice and spaces that allow you to take a blocker cube off the board, which basically means it's not over till it's over.
The board's multiple paths give at least a few options on each turn, unless an opponent has blocked your way.
And don't worry if somebody's nabbed your gold. Revenge is sweet!

Prison Bitch: The Card Game is a humorous satire card game based on the struggle of existence within male prisons. For 2 or more players, each player assumes control of one of four unique Character Decks and competes to become top dog within their prison cell. Recruit Bitches, and gather a gang of Thugs to attack other players. Use event cards such as Parole, Trip to the Infirmary and Thugs on Dope to effect or eliminate opposing Thugs. Defeat other players by beating opposing Characters in combat or reducing their Reputation Points to zero.

Each character deck includes 72 cards and a Character Card. Plus cut out money and bitch tokens. The package deal includes a Starter Set and 2 Character Decks. This works out so you get all four characters decks plus the game rules and dice.

These Keys get placed in your Ladder of Success (in any order), and if you're the first player to fill your ladder, you win. So thematically, it's neat, but what I most remember about it are the various no dice movement systems.

All players start with their pieces clicked in to a spinner in the middle of the board, which, when spun, randomly puts each player in front of one of the six paths. On your turn, you can get off and attempt that path, or spin again, possibly rearranging you - and everyone else.

Each path has it's own movement system. A few of them are flip-a-tiles, with each tile set having movement from 1-5 on them. Health has a bicycle theme, with one wheel being the tiles and the other wheel being the discard pile. Self Improvement tiles were books in a bookcase.

The Love path has an arrow-through-a-heart spinner, with the arrow pointing to your movement, 1-4. Two other paths also have themed spinners.

But the coolest of them was the Friendship path. The Hand of Friendship is a seesaw hand with a little marble in the wrist and when you seesaw it, the marble pachinko's into one of the five fingers, each having a different movement number 1-5.

When you finish a path - and they have text on some of the squares (start over get a hang-up move forward etc.) - you click back in to the spinner and hope you land on the next path you need.

The object of Bid-It! is to bid how many of a given number appear on the cards held by all players together. For instance, a bid of four 5s means the bidder believes that there are at least four fives being held by all players as a group. The next player must either make a higher bid or challenge the previous bid. Once a bid is challenged, the cards are revealed. If the bid was too high, the bidder loses a card. If not, the challenger loses a card. Players try to figure out each others hands by their bids, but remember, bluffing is not only legal, its sometimes quite effective (unless you get challenged!)

If youre very sure that your opponents bid was too high, why not bid double and put the loss of 2 cards on the line? Of course, the bidder may turn the tables on you and redouble. Or if you think that your opponents bid was exactly right, take a chance and bid Perfecto!

Some creative marketing on Ideal's part because the game is actually nothing more than a simple guessing game.  Each player or team has three pieces that they are trying to move to the center of the board.  On their turn, a player secretly chooses one of their pieces to move and holds the appropriately colored tactile for that piece in their closed hand.  Their opponent now tries to guess which color they are holding.  If their opponent guesses correctly, nothing happens.  If they guess incorrectly, the player gets to move that colored piece one step forward on the board.  When any two pieces get to the center of the board, the round is over and players score their position: +1 point for each piece in the middle of the board, -1 point for each piece left in the starting row.

8971,Orient Expedition: India (Scorpion Palace),2002,4,1,0,1,2,20,20,,Adventure Exploration Miniatures ,Modular BoardPoint to Point MovementRoll / Spin and Move,"This game is included in the Lego set 7418 Scorpion Palace, part of the Orient Expedition - India series.  The various games can be combined to increase the number of players, and you can even add games from the Orient Expedition - Mount Everest and Orient Expedition - China games.

Components consist of a board of seven interlocking tiles, a deck of 18 cards and a die (a normal six-sider with the 6 replaced by the Hook).  The rules are in 19 languages!

The board is laid out around the constructed play set (in either the standard layout or a customized one) and the equipment pieces (shovel, pistol, binoculars, spear, satchel and map) are spread randomly on the cross spaces (of which there are 14 on the board); the remaining items start in the Scorpion Palace.  The Challenge (5) and Item (8) cards are spread face up to serve as reference cards.  There are two playable characters and three bad guys.

To move, the die is rolled and the hero's Speed factor added in.  Items collected add to the Speed, Luck or Strength factors.  A hero can only carry what the figure can actually carry --two hands, maybe a backpack with a loop on its side.  Once the Scorpion Palace (or the Elephant) is reached, challenges are faced.  You choose which factor to use, although some items mean you win the challenge automatically (most items just give a bonus).  A die is added (re-roll Hooks); if your total is less than the Challenge rating, you lose an item and must try again later.  Once a Challenge is defeated, it is cleared for all players.

Outside the Palace, when you roll a Hook then the bad guy Sam Sinister challenges you.  The hero picks a skill factor and both him and Sam Sinister add a die (re-roll Hooks and ties).  A defeat again means you lose an item.  A win means you take an item from Sam Sinister!  The other two bad guys are faced the same way, except that they don't move about.

The Elephant (or any other means of transportation, if playing combined game sets) increases movement considerably since you now move one tile per die pip instead of one square (the tiles measure 5 squares across).

The game ends when a hero reaches the final square with the Golden Shield.  Both heroes add their item values to see who wins.  Jewels are worth 4 each.

8975,Hawaiian Punch,1978,5.625,16,1,2,4,20,20,Children's,Children's Game Humor ,Roll / Spin and Move,"This game represents a cooperative marketing strategy by Hawaiian Punch (the drink) and Play-Doh.  It may have originally been available by mail for UPC symbols, but that is unverified.

Essentially, this is a simple childrens' spinner and move racing game.  Each player chooses a color, taking a clay pineapple and a plastic Punchy figurine or that color. They take turns spinning and moving down the linear path toward the finish line.  The twist is that the movement token is actually the piece of clay molded into a pineapple.

Players may land on a color, which gives permission for the opponent of that color to SMASH the player's pineapple with their Punchy. Other squares are safe or give further movement instructions.  A smashed pineapple may still advance to the finish line, unless it gets too flat.  Some squares call for a Size Check and if the pineapple (of flat remnant of one) exceeds the borders of the square the player must reverse directions to remold their pineapple at the start.  There are also a few squares that allow remolding along the track.

The average game sees most pineapples getting smashed at least once or twice. The winner is the player arriving at the finish line first.  Gameplay may last as little as 10 minutes (depending on the dexterity of the players with the Play-Doh mold).

You'll soon be traveling through the Santa Clara Valley on its main highway, earning income, buying a new car, buying a home, and making investment decisions. Naturally, you can succeed or fail; just like reality, some of the decisions are up to you.

Many elements in this game are real businesses, Intel, HP, Varian, Memorex, San Jose Mercury, Stanford, San Jose State, Sant Clara Univ. Local major Banks, Auto dealers, Real Estate companies real places.  Months of research planning and coperation and their participation. No one was ever charged to be in the game. It really played well. It would have to be done by 4 locals to understand how it had a strategy and used math skills other than counting bills.

One person surmised--Appears to be a conversion of 'The Game of Life' to a local region similar to the multitude of '-opolys'  -but never played it.

This board game was the most succesful in the region of San Francisco/Silicon Valley for 11/80-1/82 selling about 30,000 copies. Only behind a popular toy Rubik's Cube. Later others ITC San Francisco, ITC Hawaii, ITC New York, RW Marathon Game, Dotto and lastly a solo effort the official-KFAT Gilroy Garlic Game 5K

In The Chips was invented by Terry Bohme, born in Palo Alto, where he attended Mayfield grammar school on El Camino adjoining Page Mill Rd.. His great great grandfather Batist Rev. Henry Merrill Henderson led his family there in 1852 and lived near Grant Road/El Camino, called Fremont Mayfield, now Mountain View. Terry attended Monte Loma- Mt. View, Benton-Sunnyvale, Pomeroy/LC Curtis- Santa Clara, and graduated Buchser HS '71 in Santa Clara. His mother Luella (Palo Alto HS '48) worked at Farnsworth, Ampex, Dalmo Victor, Fairchild, HP, Memorex, Philco and others. The game was devoloped with his cousin, Gary Suda, from April of 1980 intended for 9/80 delivery it way delayed till 11/26/80. Many elements of the game are from personal interactions he and the family had living in 'Silicon Vally'. Including knowing most of the companies from birth. His Uncle Herman Williams was a police sargent at Stanford University, his Uncle John Suda owned Stanford Plumbing  Heating, his Uncle Elmer Silva ran his own Magazine/Candy Concession at HP corp on Page Mill and raced a horse at Bay Meadows he used a barn on the corner of Page Mill/El Camino. His Uncle Ernie Larsen was the great grandson of Espinosa  Secundino Robles, the Pena Rancho owner of 3/4 of all Palo Alto. They lived in 2 houses @415 Cambridge and played on California while the grandparents owned Barron Park Cab. A lustrious group of family that did not have much education nor money, nor property by 1950s.

Terry had been a Navy Photographer and was attending De Anza/Foothill at the time. He being a year older at Monte Vista than Steve Jobs, would only meet the 2 Steves later in 1977 at Cupertino's Focus Camera shop he managed and did some early photography for Apple and handled some routine finishing. In'78 he became the Photographer for San Jose Magazine (Gill Cable) and became more intune with the phenomena that was occuring in the county. In 79-80 he worked as a minor salesman for Bantam Books, and made many bookstore/distributor/publicity rounds. A low paying job, it allowed him to meet many famous authors of the day, gain confidence and inspiration. It was really a local SF Radio show's detective contest about a detective travelling everywhere in the bay area, that inspired a Silicon Valley based game from what had already started as a book about Silicon Valley Gurus, the leaders who were not yet the celebs they are now. Access was still rather simple. In 1984-85 he worked as a salesman and developer for Nolan Bushnell's Axlon; selling assorted Trivia card games, AG Bears, Compu Bots,  Petsters. Here he met Stanford student Bob Moog, who was freelancing, Bob was very ambitious and like Steve Jobs sought greener pasture, as no one could gain security with Nolan. Bob bought a Murder Mystery game from a lady back east that had a following at the time, and with that later started University Games. Terry was responsible for promoting and introducing him to John N Hansen, a friend he had known since '81, John was like an uncle, and was a very succesful game publisher and distributor. Through John Hansen, Bob was able to get much needed distribution. Later he  John's relationship grew. Dave Scanlin, Terry's cousin, is VP of Sales for University Games 2009-

The quest is to align Charms, your playing pieces, 4 or 5 in a row by alternating dice and free moves. The intermix of plays allows you to thwart your opponents, build a stronghold, complete your path, and win the bout.

The game was created for boardgame enthusiasts who want a boardgame that is 'at the ready'. Dice, Charms, and Instructions are all kept neatly in a Velcro pocket.

Your shirt has a printed 'Plat' on the back with numbered 'Sites' which is the playing surface. The object of the game is to align 5 Charms in a row, in any direction or 4 when there are four or more players. The opening move is Norns--when the player rolls the dice and places a 'Charm' on the corresponding 'Site'. (for example, a player rolls a 2 and an 8. He or she now has the option of placing a charm on 28 or 82.)

Bumping can occur when an opponents charm already occupies the number rolled. The current player can bump the opponents charm out of play and replace it with their own.

Play continues to the left until all players have played their Norns.

The next round of turns is the 'Free Move'. On their turns, the players can choose any open site on the plat. Either building a path of 4 or 5 in a row or blocking an opponent.

Gazorping is a capture move where a player must complete a path with two opponents' charms in between. The opponents' charms are removed. The player has the option of Sliding-- moving one, and only one, of their charms into the vacated sites left during a Gazorp.

Each player controls a mobster gang consisting of one Boss and 20 members. A player can win if all other bosses are eliminated or by occupying one side of the board and playing the appropriate card related to that side.

Players have the option of either moving or cashing money:

Pieces can move on foot or up to four can move faster by car. When either one of the gang is on a Take a card space, follow that instruction. Cards can be good, or not really, at times. When stopping at a space occupied by rivals, a shootout occurs. A six sided die (two blank sides, two times one and two times two) is rolled until only one gang is present in the square. Players eliminate whatever they roll, a blank being a miss.

After placing the boss on the board all gang members and cars have to be purchased. Money can be cashed if playing pieces occupy squares in front of nightclubs or restaurants. They can gamble by rolling the die if they occupy one or more casino spaces. Most money is made when a gang succeeds in smuggling a barrel of alcohol from the owned brewery to one of the bars.
Controlling the police comes in handy as well.

In order to secure the Welsh border, William the Conqueror (recently crowned as King of England) established loyal Norman nobles in strongly garrisoned Earldoms along the frontier. What followed was decades of warfare and diplomacy as these Marcher Lords sought to extend their domains by subjugating the stubbornly independent Welsh.
 The Marcher Lords is a simulation of the Norman conquest of Wales in the 11th century on a grand strategic scale. Players assume command of Norman Earls or their Welsh foes, and make the decisions on a area movement map that will determine the course of the war. To be successful, the Normans will have to fortify their conquests by building castles and hold out against Welsh counterattacks, Viking raiders and various other threats.

One player takes on the role of the collective Axis theater commanders, chafing under the Fuhrers directives and orders embodied in the game's victory conditions. His opponent takes on the role of their Soviet counterparts, struggling to turn the tide after a year of catastrophic losses, fortunate enough to have a commander (Stalin) who allows more operational freedom, but who does not tolerate defeat.

Primary spaces are like Monopoly properties: the first to land claims them, and others then pay rent in  the form of Uncommitted Delegates. Landing on the entrance to a Caucus allows moving along its track and maybe winning its large bloc of votes (but a later player can win it back). Players may hold Demonstrations by making a declaration; if their next three moves avoid any squares with negative consequences, he gets 30 delegates from each player and can move to any square on the board. Failure means paying 20 delegates to each player.

Whenever a player lands on a Ballot square, hands are scored, and the leading player wins a Bandwagon effect (50 Delegates from each other player). A player that gets ahead therefore tries to trigger other ballots as quickly as possible.

M-onopoly in SPACE, but only in OUR Galaxy! Game components consist of: a colorful mounted mapboard with various Space properties; a long single-side printed Rules Sheet; thick cardboard Properties cards; a set of Money denominations; translucent Space Stations chips; 2 8-sided DICE; a set of Discovery cards; 5 Cardboard money holders; 6 LEAD tokens-a Space Shuttle, Soyuz Space Station, Apollo Spacecraft, Lunar Rover, Astro/Cosmo-naut, and Lunar Lander. I HIGHLY recommend painting/coating the tokens to prevent unhealthy LEAD effects for those folks so concerned. Dipping or Spray coating with a plastic type product is best and 3 coats should be sufficient.
Play is similar to games of this ilk and the game ends once the FIRST player to lose all their money and be forced into Stellar Bankruptcy is declared. The winner is the remaining player with the most money. It has some special effects such as allowing players to move where they like when landing on a Space Shuttle space and paying the TRANSPORT fee. Other special spots include: Astro Bonus; Black Hole; Fuel Base; Halley's Comet; Meteor Storm; Mission Control; Solar Roller; Space Lotto;  Space Sickness. There are special rules for just 2 players including receiving extra money  3 Claim cards prior to commencement of play. Nice and different approach from all the Terran bound versions of games like this.

The mapboard depicts 4 Arenas of combat-Ice Caves, Volcano Pit, the SWAMP, New York City,  the center starting place. There are special spots on the board such as Force Field, Transporter, and each Arena has one spot directing the player to ANOTHER Arena. The players lay out the Monster cards randomly onto the game's spaces. Then they move around and Battle the Monsters they land on and if successful, claim that Monster's Card. Each card has strengths and weaknesses depending on where that card is located in one of the Arenas. The player with the MOST cards, once the last one is battled for, is the winner. The Spinner could also make a player GAIN or LOSE a card to another player.
There are many more NEON color Monsters that were sold in separate sets and collecting them all should be even MORE fun for the lil ones.

9065,Ko-An,1994,6.375,12,3,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"Richard Breese in Sumo 16/17/18:

The Ko-An board comprises of thirty six octagonal green spaces, interlinked with twenty five square yellow spaces and surrounded by a red border. Each player has six octagonal and five square playing pieces and plays with either the black or the red pieces. To start the game each player's pieces are placed on the nearest two 'rows' to that player, on the spaces the same shape as the pieces. The object of the game is to get any one of your own playing pieces onto the opponent's back row.

All the playing pieces can move onto either the octagonal or the squared shaped spaces, however they can only move forward, not sideways or backwards. It should be noted that as the squared shaped spaces do not touch each other, a player cannot move directly from one squared shaped space to another. In addition, octagonal shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on octagonal shaped spaces and squared shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on square shaped spaces. Considering its simplicity, the game can develop in a surprising variety of ways. For example, pieces of both players may bunch up on one side of the board, several 'skirmishes' may occur all over the board, or a large stand off may arise across the center of the board. This variety adds to the attractiveness of the play.

9068,Fishing,1953,4.25,4,0,2,6,45,45,,Sports ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Pepys game in which players compete to land the greatest weight of fish.

The game board represents a stretch of English countryside divided into a grid of 26 x 37 squares. Winding along the bottom end of the board is a river into which the 34 fish counters (of quarter, half and one pound varieties) are placed. The players start the game from the Fisherman's Arms inn and take turns rolling a standard die to move their pawn across the fields to reach the river. Once at the riverbank, a player can announce he is casting for any fish which is in a direct line (including diagonally) from his pawn. If his die roll is equal to the number of squares between his pawn and the fish, the catch is made and the counter is removed from the board and placed in front of him. Many fish, particular the half pound and one pound types, can only be caught by wading in the river, a process much slower than walking.

Any time a six is thrown on the die, a Hazard card is drawn and the instructions followed. These range from missing turns in order to light your pipe or chat with a farmer, to moving your pawn to Parson's Field so you can 'meet a friend'. When the last Hazard card has been drawn, no more fishing is allowed and the players instead make their way back to the inn as quickly as possible. Players score one point for each quarter pound of fish they caught and the first three players back to the inn score an additional three, two and one points respectively.

Although a terribly simple game with little skill involved, the board has a certain charm, evoking images of lazy, summer days in the country.

The game consists of a board, divided into several bigger and smaller areas, 8 cardboard figures (4 for each team), 33 cards and 2 dice, one normal, one showing the direction. In the beginning the burglar player chooses one of the fields on the board and writes it down: here the treasure is hidden. The aim of TKKG is to find it until the end of the game.

The TKKG-player can ask a question, depending on the kind of question on the card, which the Burglar-player has to answer with yes or no. If the Burglar-player draws a card it is just put on the discard pile. Apart from questions regarding the whereabout of the treasure, there are also luck-cards, which allows the player to move a certain amount of steps on the board. If one player figure moves on a field, where an opponent stands, the opponent is taken hostage. If both players have hostages they can make an exchange, if the parties agree.
The game ends when there are no cards left. The TKKG-player then has to choose a field, where he thinks the treasure is. If he is right he wins, otherwise the Burglar-player wins.

9109,Dilemma,1990,1,2,0,2,2,20,20,,Dice ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"The designer writes:

Dilemma is a two player strategy game that is easy to learn and its fast-paced action creates extreme adrenaline pumping excitement. Dilemma has been designed to be played at a swift pace which calls for instant decision making, when players are faced with the Dilemma of attacking their opponents advancement or running for Home Base.

Dilemma is unique, a completely new concept unlike any other board game. From strategies taken from the worlds leading board games, chess and backgammon, comes 13 years of development to create the fast-paced, quick thinking, adrenaline pumping board game Dilemma.

In reality this is a dice rolling game seemingly targeted at children (Ages 7 and up). Two players have three kinds of pieces on an abstract board: Attackers, Beacons and Guardians. The Attackers are numbered 1 to 5 and each turn a die is rolled - the Attacker with that number may move. The Attackers take two steps each to surround a Beacon, which, when surrounded by three Attackers is destroyed and one of the Attackers teleports to another board to attack the opponents Guardian. You win by either surrounding the opponents Guardian by three Attackers in this manner of moving your Guardian to Home Base. The Guardian can move whenever you roll a 6. Alternately on a roll of 6 you may remove one your opponents Attackers from around one of your Beacons. On 6 you can advance or defend - this is apparently the dilemma.

In this manner you roll dice, move, roll, dice, move until someone wins. The strategy content is literally zero and there seems a reasonable chance the game won't end at all (as it is less likely to roll the numbers needed to advance than to hinder your opponent).

The pieces are elegantly cast out of soft plastic and the board is attractive in a spacey abstract kind of way.

The game was published on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, and was probably never widely circulated in spite of the designers claim:

Social Championships and World Championships are to be played using the same rules. The rules are: You must declare you are playing for the championship title. The best player over three games only is the champion. If you lose to the champion you cannot challenge again for twelve months, The only way you can challenge before that time is if the champ loses the title to another challenger, you may then challenge that champion. It is advisable not to play for the championship title until you are confident that you have played enough games to learn all strategies involved in winning the game.

Each player is the owner of a rocket ship designed to reach the moon.  In order to launch the rockets, players must first reach the Rocket Launching Platform.  Then each player is given a chance to show how well his rocket is made by trying to fly to the moon.

Each player has a thick wooden disc which represents a rocket ship of such modern design that they closely resemble 'flying saucers.'  A cardboard backstop is placed at the corner of the gameboard where the moon is located; once a player's rocket ship traverses the path on the gameboard and reaches the Rocket Launching Platform, that player flicks their rocket towards the moon.  Points are awarded for how close the rocket gets to landing on the moon (i.e., being completely inside the drawing of the moon, without touching its border), with a bonus for being the first to the launch pad.

The players are presidents of minor football teams and must try to survive to a championship among a lot of misfortunes (such as love affairs with soubrettes and striking players) and in the meantime gain a good placement in the League, major teams not withstanding. Each president buys one or more superstar players and then fields his team to play against other teams. The match is played via dice rolls and adding bonuses and penalties due to coaches, players, referees and event cards. The board is modular so that it may change for every game, and there are many cards, although some have no effect on the game (even though they give a very sharp view of the Italian football championship). A very nice and funny game that cost the developer some legal actions due to real names used in the game itself. In Italian language only.

9123,Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers: It's A Raid!,1979,5.5,4,0,3,0,30,30,,Comic Book / Strip Humor Party Game ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"I keep this game in the cardboard box you can make from Jefferson Airplane's Long John Silver album cover. It's appropriate, I promise.

I assume it's published by Rip Off Press, who made the comics. In fact, I suspect that the game was bound into a collection of Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comics. The rule sheet looks like I cut it out of a magazine. Frankly, I don't remember. You may speculate as to why that is. The game dates from about 1979 or earlier, I think.

The game is a roll-and-move extravaganza. Your goal is to get the most points or the least points (your choice). If you reach 86 points, you are out of the game (there is a Eurogame-esque point track around the perimeter). Eighty-sixed, get it? Never mind.

You must supply a movement token for each player, a counter for each player's score, and three six-sided dice. Roll three dice on your turn, and move into one of the rooms. Once you have entered a room, you roll the three dice again and refer to a chart for each room that gives you points or lets you draw a card.

There is a stack of cards for each room, so that Fat Freddy's room can be different from Freewheelin' Franklin's Room, and both are different from the Living Room. Very important to the theme of the game.

Sample card from Fat Freddy's room: You unwittingly puncture Fat Freddy's water bed, sending a torrent of water into the apartment below, and causing a COMPLAINT and giving you FOUR points.

When three complaints have occurred, a RAID is the result and each player rolls the three dice to reach the exit. Those who do not are busted . It's reminiscent of the mechanic from Escape from Colditz.

There are also three special guests to the party, represented by three special cardboard foldup pawns. The Movie Star, The Famous Author, and the Crashing Bore. You can use leftover movement (once you're in a room) to move these pawns. They block other players.

You can also get three points for loitering in the hallway, which is the kind of thing that proves this was play tested.

Actually, reading the rules now I'm not too sure how it ends or how somebody wins. But the artwork is cool and I remember enjoying it whilst simultaneously enjoying something else, if you know what I mean.

You are the Pilgrim and will begin your journey from the City of Destruction with a heavy burden of sins on your back. You desperately want to get rid of your burden but must carry it until you arrive at the cross. Your destination is the Celestial City where you will receive a wonderful inheritance. To successfully complete the journey, you must travel through some dangerous territory. Evil forces will seek to discourage and defeat you by putting hindrances and obstacles in your path. You may become bogged down in the slough, face hungry lions, battle with Apollyon or encounter the terrible Giant Despair. You must be alert at all times, prepared to use the spiritual weapons acquired throughout the journey to defeat the enemy and receive your final reward.

Similar to Life, you walk through stages of a spiritual (Christian) journey facing the obstacles as described in John Bunyan's book Pilgrim's Progress. The four pawns are pilgrims each having burdens that are removable. The object of the game is to remove the burden as fast as possible with game cards (i.e. Faith, Encouragement, Armor of God, etc...).

La die Kirche im Dorf is a strategy game for 2-4 players. By placing fields an abundant landscape emerges with fields of wheat and lakes that can be cultivated by the farmers and building sites on which farmhouses and churches can be built.

Goal of the game is to become bishop. The player who attracts the most followers to his churches becomes bishop. This happens by building churches near farmhouses. Adjacent churches however compete for the favor of the followers. The number of collected followers thus fluctuates occasionally.

Game Equipment consists of the following: a game Mapsheet-17-inches by 28-inches; a RULES section; a large double-sheet pull-out; 2-Sets of thin Game Counters; while players will have to provide their OWN 6-sided DIE.

The Mapsheet is overall WHITE with BLUE water features and BLACK print for other terrain. The Game Counters are Light BLUE  Light PINK with Darker Color silhouettes for each of the various Unit types such as: Tanks; S.P. Artillery; Towed Artillery; Helicopters; Cruise Missile Launchers; Naval Units; Air Units; and Infantry Types. Altogether, there are 44 different types of units, including Hovercraft (Soviet), IL-44 Medium Bomber (Soviet), US Army XM-2 Tank (M1-Abrams?), Soviet Aircraft Carriers, and even the U.S.N.

The RULES are very detailed and concise for being only 4 pages long, Front  Back printed. We ended up making our own crude Strategic Rear Area/Fleet Display in order to increase its size for game play. Game length is 18 turns representing 6 days and each Player Turn consists of 15 Phases (including Advanced-Air) so if you exclude the AIR game, the turns will proceed quicker.

The cards are shaped a bit like lightning bolts. There are 5 suits (Bombs, Daggers, Hearts, Jesters, and Moneybags) with 14 cards in each suit. The number of suits used in the game is the same as the number of players (e.g.: only 3 suits are used in a 3-player game)

Each player has four pieces. Players start by alternately placing pieces on a 5x5 grid, then alternate moves (moving one piece each turn to an adjacent point on the grid). Object is to get four pieces in a row, or to form a square with your four pieces.

Teko Junior rules do not allow diagonal moves. A player can win with the same patterns, but can also win by blocking his opponent's 4 pieces from moving (on a 4x4 grid).

In 1998 Guy Steele solved standard Teeko, as well as all variants proposed by the original inventor. The solution was brute force. Standard Teeko (only win with 4 in a row or a 2x2 square) is a draw with perfect play. Advanced Teeko (win with 4 in a row or a square of any size) is a win for the first player.

Reimplementations or successors:

A fully independently developed successor of the game with similar material and quite close winning conditions is Mondrago. Anyway instead of starting from a clean board Mondrago uses a fixed setup of the player's pawns. Besides winning with squares being parallel to board edges Mondrago uses diagonally and obliquely aligned perfect squares as well.

The aim of the game is for each player to harvest as many different fruits as possible in four play rounds with his apes. At the beginning of a round everyone receives an ape map and the pertinent ape chips. The fruit markers with dark background are sorted and each player receives the five different fruit sorts. The fruit markers with the bright background are sorted and laid out in piles in the table center. A play round is divided into two phases. In the first phase the players put three apes to different harvest places. These apes are called apes scouts. In the second phase the remaining apes are secretly sent to the places, where already scouts of the own race are. In addition the players take the three different kinds of fruit, at which their apes wait and lay them out next to each other behind reproached hands. At the end, they place their remaining apes against each fruit, if they wish to do so. The next step is remove the hands at the same time and the players put their apes to the appropriate places. Only the player, who has the exclusive majority at a place, can harvest a fruit chip. All other players withdraw their entire apes again. The winner may only take half of the assigned apes to his stack, the others remain at the place. If there is a draw, nobody harvests the fruit. The entire apes move then again to the players back. After four rounds that player wins, who could harvest the most different fruit kinds. Players compare their fruits and the total number decides, who the winner is.

I have been selling the games for 2 1/2 years, and have sold well over 600 expansions. So I believe there is justification for presenting them in this forum.)

Dungeons of Peril is the collective name for my first four expansions for Hero Quest, a fantasy board game published by Games Workshop in conjunction with Milton Bradley.

The 4 expansions are:

1) Heroes of the Empire - Play one of 16 new Heroes - Cleric, Warrior-Monk, Mystic, Shapeshifter, Paladin, Halfling Thief, Alchemist, Wood Elf Mage, Vampire Hunter, Rogue, Elf Archer, Weaponmaster, Imperial Ogre, Troll Wizard, Dwarf Ranger, and Shadow Walker. This set includes 16 full-color Hero cards; 24 cards with new spells, equipment, etc. for these Heroes; a reference sheet with new Potions and Items; and a 4-page rulebook.

2) Endless Dungeons - Create a virtually endless number of dungeons with this set. It includes 32 different full-color dungeon tiles, a 10-page rulebook detailing the Special Tiles (with new traps, monsters, etc.), and a double-sided reference sheet. There are 16 standard tiles (4 of each of the following types: Corridor, Small Room, Medium Room, and Large Room), 2 Stairs tiles, and 14 Special Tiles. Use the tiles to create pre-generated dungeons, or create random ones in just a few minutes.

3) Servants of Darkness - This is a set of full-color 3-D stand-ups to use instead of miniatures. The set includes 128 stand-ups - 19 different Heroes, 8 Mercenaries, and 64 different monsters (there are multiple stand-ups for the mercenaries and some monsters). The stand- ups are (roughly) to scale and vary in size, from the standard human size to the very large Dragon and Rock Giant. Also included is a 14-page rulebook for using ALL of the monsters in Heroquest.

4) Perilous Quests  This expansion provides instructions on how to create and populate an entire dungeon. The rules walk you through how to create the dungeon and how to fill it with monsters, traps, dungeon features (like a Magic Mirror or strange Mould), and special rooms. This is done using two new types of cards (Encounter and Search). You can create an entire dungeon in just a few minutes. The rules are designed to allow as much flexibility as desired when creating a dungeon. The rules can be used for pre-generated quests, but they also allow you to play without a game master and are ideally suited for SOLO play! Finally, the Dungeon Bash rules allow parties of Heroes to go head-to-head!

Perilous Quests includes the following: 20 new Artifact cards, 16 Search cards, 8 Encounter cards, 4 Lich spells, 8 new Chaos spells, 8 Chaos monster cards (4 Sorcerers and 4 Chaos Spawn), 8 Elemental monster cards, and a sheet of dungeon counters (representing various special features).

    Hurtgen Forest (Roer river valley)
    Remagen (Rhine bridgehead)




As wargames go, these series were relatively simple and quick to learn and to play - playability was favored over chrome and complexity. Arnhem was actually released separately as a full retail product with mounted board.

The player's aim is to reach the pinnacle of their pyramid first. To do this, they have to perform The Administrative Waltz, by progressing through the various qualifying zones, positions and levels, and manipulating his opponents to retard their progress.
This performance simulates the bureaucratic rise to success, which is dependent on no one particular attribute, being achieved through a five-point plan which comprises...
-Qualifications (formal educational qualifications)
- Progressions (promotion - sometimes through merit, other times through luck)
- References (opinions from superiors/colleagues)
- Manipulations (tactical play and actions to advance oneself to the detriment of others)
- Bonuses (Incentives and fringe benefits)

There are two versions of play for The Administrative Waltz- a lengthier and a shorter version.
The game The Administrative Waltz is a game inspired by a satirical book of the same name. (The Administrative Waltz- G. Stringer  M. Wallace- 1976)

 The container for this is a pinkish fold-over cardboard with a large cut-out on the Front and smaller cut-out on the back for storage of the Mapsheet(front) while some sort of pocket is used on the inside back. It's best to provide your own plastic baggies for counter storage and you supply the 6-sided DIE needed. 
 The Game components consist of the following: a 17-inches by 24-inches Mapsheet; a HUGE fold-out RULES sheet(about the same size as the Mapsheet); a Turn Track Chart(with RULES modifications); over 72-5/8-inch rounded corners cardboard Counters including some small round ones for Supply Record keeping; and a very small Sheet with Combat Computation Charts on one side and Historical Notes on the reverse.
 On the mostly GRAY Mapsheet at the upper portion is a RED section which contains the Sequence of Play; Unit Movement Abilities; Terrain Analysis Chart; Attack Analysis Chart; Attack Taken/Supply Expenditure Chart; and a Supply Point Index for EACH player. The Mapsheet has some RED features while the rest are of a BROWN color. The Counters are ORANGE with BLACK print for 8th Army units and GRAY with BLACK/ORANGE print for Axis units, with a few PINK informational markers. The UNIQUE symbols used for the AXIS units is actually what the Wehrmacht used for their unit types on their situation maps and vehicles! A FIRST for any company at this time in the industry. They take some getting used to for NON-historical minded folks. 
 There are 3 Scenarios from which to choose to play: Battleaxe-3-Turns-14-15 July 1941; Crusader-10-Turns-18/19 November-7/8 December 1941; and Gazala-15-Turns-27/28 May-24/25 June 1942. Sequence of Play is: 1.Reinforcement Segment; 2.Initial Movement; 3.Combat Segment; 4.Exploitation Movement; 5.Supply Point Index Adjustment and then the second Player repeats these. Optional Rules include Reserve status indication  possible Breakdown of Armor types using a die-roll after Exploitation Movement. Units are back-printed for step losses and allows for Replacements to be incorporated when available. 
 Overall, this game introduces some aspects used by other companies later on, such as Wehrmacht symbols(used by Avalon Hill in the Longest Day game), single Combat factor printed on the counter and having a set movement rate for EACH type, and differing Combat results tables for various combinations of attacks. I was unable to determine ANY credits by anyone involved in the production of this.

The higher the HP, the more points the player gets for it. At the beginning each player gets 8-10 cards, depending on the number of players. Turn after turn he can get new cards, but must also put cards into the discard pile. If one player has enough parts to put a motorcycle together, he knocks on the table, if it is his turn. Now all players can draw one more card before phase 2 of the game begins. Successively the players lay out a motorcycle, normally the smallest possible combination. A motorcycle consists of a front wheel, an engine and a rear wheel with the gear change. Then the knocking player begins and plays one of his cards. This can be done in four ways. If possible, one can attach another card to the motorcycle; one may also exchange a card of the owned motorcycle and put the exchanged card on the discard pile. And a player might also put a covered card on the discard pile, if he has no more use for it. Apart from that players can play cards against other players to bug other players, if the target player does not have a defense card.
When all cards have been played, players count the points they get for their motorcycles (HP multiplied with the amount of gear shifts(rear tire) and front tire). The HP is entered in a block, and a new round begins. After 10 rounds the player with the highest total score wins.

In the book Emil's money is stolen after he falls asleep on a train. He realizes he has been robbed and enlists the help of some other children, the detectives, to help find the man who stole his money.

The game consists of a two-piece board, which joins together like a puzzle, and 31 tiles depicting city scenery that stick vertically into the board. There are 34 places on the board on which the players can move. Each one is covered by a wooden cylinder. The picture of the criminal is under one of the cylinders. One player will move this cylinder around the board.

One player plays the role of the criminal, Herr Grundeis, and the other players are the detectives. Herr Grundeis needs to try to cross the board from the station to the park before the detectives, played by the other players, find him. If Herr Grundeis reaches the park, he wins. If one of the detectives finds him, the detectives win. Herr Grundeis moves first. He roles the black die. The detectives now put on their blindfolds. Herr Grundeis now moves up to the number of spaces indicated on the die. He cannot move more than the number of spaces indicated on the die, but he can move less. The detectives see the die so they know how many spaces the criminal may have moved. The detectives remove their blindfolds and are given a clue that partially describes the tile in front of the criminal. The detectives role the white die in turn and move up to the number of spaces indicated, hopefully stopping in front of a tile that meets the criteria mentioned in the clue. The player checks bottom of the cylinder he has landed on to see if Herr Grundeis is hiding there. Each detective roles the die and moves before Herr Grundeis moves again.

But who can build a house exclusively with doors and shelves? Players are missing many kinds of building material, which has to be traded with the other house owners. Thus one exchanges a door for a heating or a plug socket for a tap. In that way the house is gradually finished. But the game takes a twist, as a player has to set a column in his house whenever he throws a six with the dice. With the fifth six one receives the ceiling plate of his house and continues to build on the first floor. Whenever one player has the first house finished (after the completion of the first floor) the game  ends, but the finishing player does not necessarily have to have won. For each complete room the players get points, and whoever has the most points wins the game.

Bau auf! is set in the former GDR and gives a funny insight with which problems people had to cope in that time, when they wanted to build a house.

At the beginning the small treasure cards are shuffled and then put on special fields on the board. Subsequently, the small definition cards are put on the fields at the side of the board. The active player throws all four dice and uses the result, to move two of his figures. In order to receive a small treasure card, two figures must face each other and the treasure card must lie between them after a movement. If the sum of the two figures together is just as large or larger than the numerical value of the small definition card, the treasure may be taken up. The player looks at it secretly and puts it down before him. Each player may have only one treasure of the six different kind of treasures. If a player takes up a second small treasure card, he decides afterwards, which of the two treasures he keeps and which he gives to a fellow player, who still doesn't possess the appropriate card. Apart from collecting small cards, later in play players increasingly duel each other. If a figure reaches the field of an opposing figure they fight a duel, if they have the same kind of treasure. The aggressor chooses whether he would like to make a duel with or without treasure cards. In a duel without treasure cards each player throws a dice and adds its result to the value of his figure. The attacker wins, if he has a higher total result than the defender. In the duel with treasure maps the attacker selects a treasure sort, which both players possess. The opponents uncover their treasures, and add the result of a dice throw and the value of the figure. The attacker wins again, if he has a higher total result than the defender. The loser is banished and the figure is again placed in front of the suitable entrance and must be brought back into play from there. 
The game is over, when all players possess the six different kinds of treasure. The small treasure cards are uncovered and the individual numerical values of each treasure are multiplied by the numerical value of the small definition cards. The player with the highest sum total wins.

Throughout the game he must learn to anticipate possible pollution of his lake, attempt to avoid the problem of overpopulation, manage his finances efficiently, and consider the problem of possible pollution coming from upstream. A player wins the game by controlling water pollution successfully and thereby being the first to completely stock his lake.

Each player is the Commissioner of Water Pollution for their own lake.  Each lake is connected by a series of rivers and surrounded by potential polluters.  The first player to completely stock his lake with organisms while controlling the pollution from the nearby community of farms, industries and residential developments is the winner.  Clean Water acquaints players with some of the complexities involved with dealing different types of pollutants while maintaining a healthy ecosystem.

Players roll a die to move around the board and collect organisms for their lakes. Landing on a pollution space will kill off some of the higher organisms and increase the lower organisms, but players can purchase Abatement cards to try to avoid the pollution. Overpopulation of any one type of critter will also disturb the ecology, but players can occasionally exchange lower organisms for higher ones. Players also have opportunities to bid for federal funding. The first player to fill his lake with the required organisms wins the game.

9180,Bug Strife,1999,7,5,0,2,6,30,30,Wargames,Animals Economic Fantasy Humor Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Bug Strife is a tabletop game that reminds me of many real time strategy games for the PC.  Two or more players begin with certain bug forces and then, through food acquisition, hive construction and combat, establish their side as dominant on the battlefield.

The book for Bug Strife is 33 pages of typing paper covered with a decently sturdy cardboard cover (monchrome green). Clip art and other cartoons are interspersed in the text and the rules are set out in a logical, well organized manner WITH a working table of contents. The last couple of pages are very useful and welcome play-aids that include a turn sequence summary, bug summary, unit cards and terrain effects table.

In addition to a playing surface you'll need 6-sided dice (d6), tape measures or rulers, pens/pencils, scratch paper, and poker chips or something else to represent food, and any terrain (including nest structures) that you want to put out. Last but not least, you'll need something to represent your bug army--usually the cheap plastic dollar store bug bags.

Bugs are placed in functional groupings based on their shared characteristics for game terms. Players can field colony insects, bees, aphids, beetles, carnivores, flying carnivores, spiders, flying raiders, slugs/snails, worms, caterpillars/grubs. These groupings serve as a common language for players to understand that different models are capable of different things.

Bugs are rated in a number of characteristics. If a statistic is marked 0, then that bug cannot use that characteristic.

Leadership affects how well a bug can recruit other bugs to join his army (from offboard not the opponent's pieces). Defense and Attack are used during to determine individual combat attacks and represent a bug's ability to defend itself (shells, armor, etc.) and ability to inflict damage on an opponent, respectively. Movement is a straight translation to inches per turn movement allowance. Wounds is the number of hits a bug can endure before being removed from the game and Gathering represents how well a bug collects resources.

There are six phases in a turn.  What a bug does during one or more phases during a turn can limit what it can do in other phases. For example, a bug with raiding skill can do all of the following in a single turn: Raid, Move, Attack and Gather.

Phase 1 is Maintenance/Raiding. This is a logistics phase that requires players to feed their bugs (unfed troops simply leave the battlefield in search of food---never to return).  Bugs capable of raiding can feed themselves, provided there is food available to them.

Phase 2 is Movement. You can move your bugs up to their movement allotment in inches. Some bugs can move faster than others (snails and slugs being the slowest in the game). Terrain affects movement, too so moving across a featureless plain on the gaming board produces faster movement than, say, climbing a hill or moving through leaf litter (jungle).

Phase 3 is Construction. Only bugs with engineering ability may use this skill. Tunnels, caches and hive areas are different constructions that a bug general can have his troops with engineering abilities to construct.

These structures help defend his army and the ever important food supply. Tunnels ease friendly movement and restrict enemy entrance into the nest. Hives grant defenders an advantage during defense of the nest and each hive in a player's control adds a bonus to his ability to recruit new bug enlistees---after all, hives are considered the sign of a successful bug civilization. Caches serve to store food and to aid in defending food from invading bugs. Spiders also have the ability to build traps to catch enemy bugs.

Recruiting is Phase 4, during which bugs with leadership attributes can attempt to add more forces (randomly drawn from the bug collection off table).  Successful dice rolls, with bonuses applied if the recruiter wishes to use food as enticement, allows the player to add additional bugs to his army.

Attack is Phase 5 and usually takes place at close range of 1 inch or less (aphids can squirt acid at up to 6). Attacking involves an attacker and a defender (duh). Attack bonus equals the defender's Defense score subtracted from the attacker's Attack score (yes, negatives are possible). This bonus is then applied to a 2d6 roll that is compared to a quick table. Results range from no effect, to fleeing, to multiple wounds being dealt out.

Gathering is the last phase of a turn. Bugs capable of gathering simply roll dice equal to this stat.  The result represents the amount of food they have collected for use next turn or storage.

Games may be scenario driven (a sample scenario is provided) or open where each player basically does his/her level best to completely wipe out the opponent. Victory objectives such as kill the enemy general or destroy/steal half the enemy food supply are very helpful in focusing the game on more than hack and slash (though those games are fun, too).

Overall, a solid game with a nice logistics phase.  Although the rules are not written for a gameboard per se, Bug Strife would very easily convert to a large hex board or terrain map and in my opinion benefits from playing on this type of pre-measured surface.  It returns the game to a more boardgame like feel and helps minimize measurement fudging and arguments associated with measuring tape errors.

For example, all maps should be cards.

    
    
        -

    


A game about snail running. The players lay color rows out before themselves using their snail maps. Each player tries to protect  their color rows as quickly as possible, because only those cards score when they are played.

The game consists of 110 cards with different moves for snails on them. Among them are colored snails, Schnarchschnecken, snails cards and turbo-snails. To begin play, all cards are mixed and each player is dealt 5 cards for their hand. In addition 3 sets of snail cards are laid out in the center of the table. (thus again in each case 5 pieces) are laid out. These form the exchange supply.

If a player puts the fifth snail into a color row, this row is protected. Those cards are put aside and are counted as one point per card. Added to his own snail cards,  the player receives a card with  same color numbers as the other players. There is also a wild card color which can be added. That card is is collected by all, is thus particularly lucrative but in  addition it is risky to try and collect  . By means of this pfiffigen mechanism the author achieves a high interaction between the players. These are practically always into the play merged.

The special snail maps bring an additional attraction into the play. With the Schnarchschnecke a  player is forced to an obligation break by a round. With a turbo-snail   can   lock even if  5 cards do not  lie in the row. And finally the card snails: These serve to allow a player to exchange a card from his hand with one the center of the table.

Part of the Goldsieber à la Carte line of games.

Attila features two of the few major battles thearmies of the Hunnic Confederation under King Attila fought against Rome: The Utus against Eastern Rome (The Utus) and the Catalaunian Fields against Western Rome. Gamers have the opportunity to pit the Huns both at their peak at the Utus, and then at somewhat reduced ability at the Catalaunian Fields against the rather different armies of Eastern and Western Rome.

The Attila module introduces some changes to the Cataphract rules including the elimination of the Size rating and the reassessment of the missile fire effectiveness of the composite bow based on the latest research.In addition, Attila includes special rules to account for the unique style of steppe warfare practiced by the nomadic Huns - the feigned retreat along with rules covering defections and barbarian impetuosity.

Simple GBoH versions of both battles are included.

It was the largest pocket formed by the Soviets since the watershed battle of Stalingrad two years earlier and witnessed some of the heaviest combat in the Russo-German War.

In the depths of the winter of 1944, the Soviet Red Army executes a prior operation against a salient in the German lines near the town of Cherkassy in the Ukraine. Prevented by retreat order of Adolf Hitler, the German forces soon found themselves pocketed, their only supply source an airfield at the town of Korsun. The Soviets relentlessly tighten their stranglehold against the German troops in the pocket. At the same time, the Germans mounted increasingly strong relief efforts against the outer Soviet perimeter. Can the German relief forces break the Soviet lines before the Soviet forces completely destroy the pocketed troops?

9232,Rebel Yell,1995,6.33333,24,3,2,2,240,240,Wargames,American Civil War Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Rebel Yell is a simulation of American Civil War small-unit tactics. The playing pieces in the game represent companies of infantry and cavalry or sections of artillery Each infantry and cavalry unit has one strength point and is equivalent to between 45 and 100 men, depending upon the scenario. Each artillery unit has two strength points and equals two guns. The players of Rebel Yell assume the roles of divisional commanders.

Each game turn is broken down into segments. During an action segment, the units of a particular player may conduct a single action. In the beginning modules these actions are: Move, Fire, Assault, and Rally. During any Small Arms segment, the units of a particular player may only fire.

There are no movement phases, fire phases, etc., as there are in other Civil War games. This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.

One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the problem of approach,in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of modern weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.

Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.

Once players have learned all the rules (or even before), they can design their own scenarios. The game includes six geomorphic maps. Because the maps can be aligned in a variety of ways, the players can recreate a microscopic examination of virtually any Civil War engagement.

Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area. Rebel Yell is big only in the sense that it is detailed.

9250,UNO Madness,1995,4.87222,18,1.5,2,4,20,20,Children's,Action / Dexterity Children's Game Electronic ,Tile Placement,"UNO Madness is an implementation of the classic card game UNO with a mechanical gimmick.  The game is played on a spring-mounted tray.  After latching, the tray springs when a mechanical timer expires.  The tray has 24 slots lined in a spiral path; the final slot (in the centre) is labeled with the word UNO.

At the start of the game, the tray is latched and the timer wound up.  Each player draws five tiles and keep their hand secret from the others.  The first player places a numbered tile in the first slot on the tray and starts the timer.  Continuing with the next player in sequence, the players follow the standard UNO rules in playing their tiles (color succeeds color, number succeeds number, draw when unable to play, etc).  They also have to say Madness to signify the end of their turn.

Play stops when a player has played his or her last tile, has played a tile on the last slot, or when the timer expires.  In the first two cases, the player records his score (according to UNO rules, summing up values of the tiles in other players' hands) and the game is reset (tiles reshuffled and redrawn, etc).  For the last case, everybody keeps their hand and the player who has yet to finish his or her turn when the board has sprung draws four more tiles.  Play then continues.  The game ends after a certain accumulated score has been reached or a certain number of rounds have been played.

9255,Thataway,1992,5.77778,9,1,2,2,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"A two player abstract strategy game played on a board which is developed by the players over the course of the game.

Each player starts with ten pawns on a six by six chequered board. Each turn consists of moving one of your pawns and placing a card. To begin with, pawns can only move one square forwards or backwards and cannot capture your opponent's pawns. However, once a pawn is moved, a movement card is placed onto the square it vacates. Movement cards have arrows showing possible moves - directions and lengths. The more possible directions (eight being the maximum) the card shows, the shorter the maximum move. Pawns which begin their move on one of these cards follow one of the arrows and are allowed to capture enemy pawns. When a pawn moves off a movement card, the next movement card may be placed in any vacant space on the board, in any orientation. Thus there is scope for clever placement to limit what your opponent can do. Gradually the board fills up with movement cards which show the possible moves from each square. Moves are essentially chess-like, but some are more limited, for example some movement cards allow movement in a straight line in only three directions, or diagonally in only two.

The game ends either when one player has captured all their opponent's pawns; when one player loses due to having no legal move; or when all 36 movement cards are placed, in which case the winner is the one with the most remaining cones.

I've no idea if any further issues were produced eventually and this appears to be one of the first attempts at Desk Top Publishing.
 The components for this game consist of the following: 11-inches by 17-inches paper Mapsheet; 2-sets of thick paper counters-1-GREEN(U.S., French, British), 1-TAN(Germans  Italians); a Set of BASIC  ADVANCED Rules; and on the BACK of the Magazine are the Map Legend; Terrain Effects Chart; Combat Resolution table; Turn Record track; and Weather effects tables. The Mapsheet, Unit Deployment  Reinforcement Charts and Counters will have to be separated from the magazine while the Counters will have to be cut apart for use.
 The Map sheet is TAN overall with BLACK print for all terrain details. The thick paper counters have Nationality indications on top of the UNIT Type symbol, Historical Formation numerals, and basically have separate COMBAT  MOVEMENT numerical designations ALL printed in BLACK.
 The BASIC game Sequence of Play is as follows: A)Reinforcement Phase-Advance the TURN marker one, then BOTH players conduct placement or withdrawal of any Units indicated; B)AXIS Movement; C)AXIS Combat; D) ALLIED Movement; E)ALLIED Combat; F)Victory Determination.
 The ADVANCED game adds Replacements, Weather Determination, Tactical Air, an Operations Phase, Headquarters Units, Special Units Abilities, Cohesion Factors, Variable Forces allowances, Operations Points Allocations, Movement through Enemy Zones of Control,  Overruns.
 During the Operations Phase, each player rolls a single 6-sided DIE with highest die-roller going first. He then rolls a 6-sided DIE and that's how many Operations Points he uses at that time. Then the other player gets to roll 2--6-sided DICE for HIS O.P.s. After this, then EACH player will roll 2--6-sided DICE, consecutively, until BOTH decide NOT to spend anymore O.P.s. Units can be Moved  then Attack including Overruns, but once they DO conduct Combat, then they're done for the turn. There is an Operations Chart with action COSTS indicated for use during the Operartions Phase. An interesting approach with somewhat novel concepts for being the first attempt at publishing a very limited run edition for this company.

9260,Hoplite Warfare,1980,6,1,0,2,2,10,10,Wargames,Ancient Miniatures Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Hoplite Warfare (650-330BC) tabletop Miniatures rules

These rules are designed to simulate the warfare of Archaic and Classical Greece, from the rise of the Hoplite (along with the polis as the typical political unit in Greece) to his eclipse by other systems and the decline of the polis as an important institution. By extension, the rules also cover areas and times where other races were equipped as and fought in the same style as Hoplites; The rules will also cover races and civilizations which clashed with Hoplite armies.

The period of Hoplite domination in the Mediterranean we have taken as beginning c.675 B.C. However, there can be no set date for the end of the Hoplite. In the Eastern Mediterranean world we have taken the battle of Gaugamela 331 B.C.; in Italy we have taken c. 386 B.C. when at the Allia a Roman Hoplite-style army was defeated by Gauls, signaling the end of Hoplite tactics in Italy; but in Sicily Hoplites still seem to have been dominant till the time of Agathokles (d. 285 B.C.). Thus, unlike the established ideas in ancient wargaming, these rules are restricted to a narrow time span and a limited geographical area. They do not pretend to universalize, nor are they immutable dogma  they may be adapted to suit the individual wargamers research.

9261,Hellenistic Warfare,1980,7,1,0,2,2,240,240,Wargames,Ancient Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Hellenistic Warfare (329-146BC) table top miniatures rules

This is designed as a supplement to Hoplite Warfare, to extend the latters time period from its rather vague endpoint at some point in Alexanders campaign in Persia to 146 B.C. when, with the destruction of the cities of Carthage and Corinth, Rome stamped her authority over the Mediterranean world. So to use this booklet you also need Hoplite Warfare.

The political and military history of this period is set on a great canvas. In the Eastern Mediterranean the armies of great monarchies replace the small wars of Greece, and the Greek cities band together into political leagues in an attempt to match these large kingdoms; while in the West, was Romes vast struggle against Carthage. Finally Rome faced the Hellenistic kingdoms and the Greek Leagues; those that opposed her, one by one succumbed.

This was one of the great ages of scientific warfare. In the Hellenistic world armies of professional soldiers were led by generals who knew their business, the founders of the great kingdoms being, as it were, schooled by Alexander. Roman generals usually incompetently led soldiers whose length of service made them equally professional. The Carthaginians relied almost totally on professional mercenary soldiers.

Despite initial apprehensions, it was found that the modifications needed to simulate this period were not huge. The changes that have been made are an increase in armor classes to cover more heavily equipped cavalry, some changes to morale to cover the effect of elephants, shooting is modified to cater for the Roman pilum (as is handtohand combat), the system for catering with unformed and disorganized troops is changed and the major addition, rules to simulate elephants. The training classes are slightly altered and rules added to simulate cavalry dismounting to fight as infantry taking the Omens is catered for.

The rules are a spinoff from Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age (by Lin Carter and Scott Bizar) which embody a functional combination of systems that lead to a playable and accurate simulation of medieval warfare when played without magic

Medieval battles were set piece affairs usually leading to an uncontroversial decision. Opposing armies deployed in sight of each other, just beyond maximum missile range, and received the sacraments before the engagement began. When infidels fought against them, European Christians displayed a special fervor to conquer all before them. Ironically, there were occasions, such as the sack of Rome in 1084, when commanders dispensed with the sacraments owing to the mixed composition of their armies. Feudal cavalry was the dominant battle winning component for most armies in this period, but its success often relied upon a close sense of coordination with civic militia and archer units, or special elite mercenary menatarms who formed the base from which the attack sprang. When peasant levies were included in any army, they were placed where they could do the least harm to the enemy or their own allies.

Woods, marshes, rivers, rocky terrain, or ocean fronts sometimes covered an armys flank as an anchor, but most battles took place in the open on a plain or in defense of a dominating height. Western armies rarely employed fancy turning maneuvers, and most battles between similar forces were resolved by direct brute force. Even so, the value of committing the last reserve for the ultimate decision was well appreciated. Islamic, Eurasian, and Byzantine armies, of course, applied much more sophisticated strategems, such as feigned retreats and sweeping double enfilades.

I mention this because in my 1975 2nd edition of Jedko's the African Campaign, they list DUNGEON! as a part of their product line. TSR later on packaged some Jedco(new sp) games releases under their company logo which became the Wizard symbol.
 This Rules Booklet has 50 pages including their Select Bibliography, 3-Musketry Tables(Point Blank, up to 6 distance, up to 12) with from 1-50 figures firing for each  uses a single 6-sided DIE, an Artillery Roundshot Fire Table, an Artillery Cannister Fire Table, a Melee Results Table, a Terrain Effects Table,  a Constructions Effects Table.

The only thing lacking is the numerous and voluminous Uniforms colorings associated with this era. Osprey publishing has made an entire industry with just this Historical era although they do produce lots of books for many others as well.
 Overall, a well detailed depiction of Napoleonic warfare which can be scaled to your liking from individuals to entire Armies if you prefer.

Tape measure, a Protractor for determining Gunfire  Observation, Artillery Facing changes, Gatling Gun Firing Arcs, and Cannon  Howitzer firing arcs.

It is suggested that players provide Figures for their characters in the following positions: on Horseback; on Foot; Kneeling; Prone. I would also suggest Figures displaying various armaments such as Pistol wielding, Rifle Armed, Knife or Sabre displayed, etc. The Rules CAN also be used for 25mm Figures and there are annotations in ( ) for this scale. There are Character Record, Artillery Record, and Horse Record Sheets which will have to be copied in order to provide enough for everyone. It is suggested that each Player control no more than 6 Characters per playing. There is a Pregenerated Character List to help gets things started quickly, but most folks will want to create their own Old West figure they have in mind. Players will find a Regional Map of the Plains section of the U.S.A. with various Native Areas located upon it and State's borders with numerous Forts  Towns of the Old West. There is even a Detail map of an imaginary Old West area for assistance in starting up a Campaign for whatever the player's desire. The Back Pages of the Rules Booklet contain Movement Charts, Movement Modifiers, Skill Challenge Damage Chart, Observation Modifiers, General Skill Challenge Modifiers, Missile Combat Chart, Melee Combat Chart, Campaign Observation Modifiers, and Weapon  Range Chart.

The Sequence of Play is as follows: 1.Initiative; 2.Movement; 3.Observation; 4.Missile Combat; 5.Melee Combat; 6.Artillery Fire; 7.Static Actions. NOT all of these will be followed since not everyone will be using some such as Artillery everytime. During Static Actions, players will do anything NOT covered in previous phases, such as Draw Weapons, Reload, Gamble at the Saloon, etc. There are even provisions allowed for conducting a Campaign while it is suggested that a Referee be employed for obvious reasons. The Designer has included some of the more well known names of Western characters as well as the better recognized encounters. Another section provides a Bibliography for Western Novel Authors, Western Themed Movies, and Western Non-Fiction books. So Circle the Wagons and Keep them Doggies Rollin'...yee-HAAAAA...*ker-RAACK*...Rawhide!

The Game is contained in a Ziploc Baggie with a 22x34 7-Color mapsheet, 100-Glossy Color Cardboard Counters, a Large Rules Booklet, 2-Casualty  Ammo Record sheets with a reduced planning mapsheet printed on the reverse(1 for EACH Player) while it is suggested that copies be made of these, and Players will need to provide their OWN writing utensils  ORDERS paper as well as at least (1)-10-sided DIE.

The mapsheet is primarily TAN  Light TAN overall, with Light BLUE  BLUE water features, RED Road lines, GRAY Slope hexsides, Gullies,  Higher Levels, and BLACK print for the Narrows  Buena Vista buildings. Included on the mapsheet are: the Game Turn Track; Terrain Effects Chart; a 4-Part Impulse Track; the Mountain BOX; the Saltillo BOX; 2-Gun Fire Tables(Case  Ball); a Small Arms Fire Table; a Fire Value Modifiers Table; and a Morale Modifiers Table.

The game Counters are GREEN with large WHITE Unit Symbols and BLACK print for the Mexicans  BLUE with large WHITE Unit Symbols and BLACK print for the Americans. There are also informational counters in both GREEN  BLUE colors as well as WHITE with BLACK print.

The scale of the game is 90 yards across for each hex, a Strength Point represents 25 Men or 1 Gun, and a Turn equals 20 Minutes split into (4)-5 minute impulses. A Game Turn Sequence consists of the following: 1.RAIN phase(only on Turns 27 through 31); 2.1st Impulse-a)Reinforcement phase, b)Command phase, c)Cavalry Charge Initiation phase, d)Tactical Movement phase, e)Charge phase, f)Simultaneous Fire phase, g)Shock phase followed by 3 MORE similar Impulses as the latter detailed previously. Once the 4 Impulses are completed, then there is a Strategic Movement phase, a Rally phase, and a Mountain Skirmish phase rounding out the Turn. It is during the Command phase that Players will write out and conduct activation of their Orders, which require a certain number of Impulses before they arrive at their intended destinations.

The Rules go into details such as Sighting, Force Marching, Multi-hex Units(line extension), Stacking, Facing, Formations, detaching Rifle Companies(U.S. only), Attacking in the Mountain  Saltillo Boxes, Casualty marking, Ammunition depletion, Routing, Rallying, Special Rules such as RAIN, Mexican Units besieging Saltillo and their conditional release as well as the American's Forces there, Optional Units, and Resupplied Mexican Forces continuing the battle beyond the actual time limits. There are 2 Scenarios: 1.February 23, 1847 starting turn 10 to turn 40;  2.February 22  23, 1847--40 turns long beginning with turn 1. An extensive Historical Notes is written up accompanying this with Bibliography  designer's notes and an Example of play with commentary.

This appears to be another attempt at introducing a miniatures based concepts  game mechanics into a conventional cardboard counters game. Although the thought processes involved are more adept at producing the desired effects of delayed Orders implementation than some previous games, only devoted wargamers could adequately appreciate this facet of play. This is definitely NOT for the casual wargamer, but more for the dedicated Historical feel for the era enthusiast.

9276,Medieval Warfare,2008,7.72222,9,3,2,8,120,120,Wargames,Fighting Medieval Miniatures Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Miniature rules for wargaming tactical level combat from 450 AD to 1500 AD.

Medieval Warfare (MW) was awarded GAMA's Best Historical Miniatures Rules of 1998 at Origins 1999.

The scale is 1 figure equals 20 men, with 1 inch equals 25 yards (for 15mm figures). One turn equals 5-10 minutes. An army divides into a number of Battles (Divisions), each Battle commanded by a general.

Units contain a number of stands.

MW contains a large amount of research into Army lists: 93 are in the back of the rules, from Late Patrician Roman (mid 5th Century) to Burgundian Ordinance (late 15th century). These are presented in WRG 7th style, with unit name, type, weapons, and purchase points. Four scenarios are also in the rules.

The sequence of play consists of Recovery (Rally phase), placing tactical orders, conducting movement, missile fire, and melee.

For command, a commander receives between 3 and 5 orders, depending on his competence. These can be assigned in the second phase of each turn--you receive a choice of 6 orders (charge, move, hold, defend, retire, and recover). Unlike the random pip system, the number remains a constant each turn, rather than a random number from 1 to 6.

MW contains two kinds of movement: strategic and tactical. Strategic occurs when units are beyond 12 of the enemy--they receive additional movement of between 25% to 100% more, depending on the unit. However, they cannot come closer than 12. Again, this is similar to march movement in WRG 7th--although a lot more restricted.

Tactical is just that. When you want to close, you must use the slower tactical movement. For example, armored and close order infantry move 4 inches, loose order move 6 inches, and so on.

Terrain can slow your move. When charging and routing, each unit receives a random move amount.

For example, close order armored infantry go 1 inch plus an averaging die roll (2-5) for a total of 3-6 inches. Defenders have the option to counter charge.

There are several times during a turn, for example, such as charging and counter charging, when morale tests are necessary. This is a d10 roll, with various modifiers. If you fail by a little, not much happens. Fail by a lot and suffer extreme consequences.

Missile fire is by stand, with a d10 random roll.

Melee uses an averaging die (2-5) to which modifiers are added and then multiplied by the number of stands. The resulting number is divided by 10 to get the number of casualties. When a unit receives a number of casualties equal to the number of figures on a stand, the stand is removed.

When you lose 1/3 of your troops, it's morale check time for everyone. And then every time you lose a unit, more morale checks.

The game ends when a general either concedes defeat or all his troops run away or are destroyed.

Travel like a water droplet around the world.

Water is the source of all life. The players of AGUA experience our exciting world in the shape of a droplet of water and collect all those experiences that water droplets can make on their way through the water circulation.

The players travel as droplets of water on various waterways through the world and collect experiences (i.e. experience points). At the beginning of the game four of the water ways on the game board are interrupted by 10 holes and cannot be used by the droplets. In the course of the game these holes are filled with experience points. The players will collect their own experience points. Their value again depend on the other experience points placed on the game board which can be modified by the players during the game.

The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner. The game is over when all holes in the waterways are filled, so that all waterways are permeable to the water droplets.

--end of rules description

The board is modular and has several sections which can be changed and several of each so the board will be different every time.

Two players compete to find the mountain (presumably mineral-bearing and therefore valuable) portions of the planet, using four playing pieces each of which can move across only one of the four terrain types. Terrain tiles are placed face-down, and are turned up when a player attempts to move a piece into the tile. If it's a mountain tile, the moving player scores a point. Tiles are turned over even if the moving piece isn't allowed to move into that type of terrain. The game ends when all the tiles have been turned face-up, and the player with the high score then wins. The counter mix deliberately provides more tiles than spaces on the board, but only 16 mountain tiles.

9322,Goal Line Stand,1980,5.25,6,2,2,2,360,360,,Sports ,Hex-and-Counter,"Remember Scrimmage (by SPI)?  Well, Goal Line Stand is Scrimmage done right.  This is a game of tactical American football played on a hex grid field with each player represented by an individual counter.

The heart of the game is the movement system, which is complex and, IMHO, realistic.  Player counters can occupy a hex center, a hex side or a hex corner (vertex).  Players spend movement points to move forward (straight or diagonally), backward (ditto), or sideways.  Players can be facing in 1 of 12 directions.  However, not all types of movement and facing are possible at all times - it depends upon where the counter is located (hex center, side or corner), and upon the position played and game situation.  Some movement bonuses are available.

Each player is rated for: mobility, power, blocking, tackling, rushing, running, passing  pass receptions.  Substitutes are available at some positions.  A player may be in 1 of 2 stances: decelerated (as at the snap) or accelerated.  In an accelerated stance, a player can move much farther but has less maneuverability.

There are extensive rules governing illegal movement locations and player contact.  Blocking, tackling  rushing are resolved (after contact) with percentage dice and a variety of die roll modifiers.  Movement after contact differs depending upon success or failure of the attempt.

Fake and real handoffs are possible.  Forward and lateral passing (fake and real) is handled in a realistic (and, again, complex) manner.  Passes may be lobs, lofts or bullets - each is handled in a different way for passing accuracy calculations and the chance of a deflection or interception.

Like Scrimmage, Goal Line Stand ignores the kicking game.  Fumbles and penalties are not accounted for.  Four learning scenarios are provided and, in my experience, are necessary to grasp this unique game system.

The game still suffers from a problem inherent in the concept - moving each player in 1/2 second intervals means it can easily take an evening to play 4 downs (between experienced players).  That said, it is an interesting play for true football fanatics.

9331,Tic-Tac Dough,1957,5.77273,11,0,2,3,30,30,,Movies / TV / Radio theme Trivia ,,"Tic-Tac-Toe with trivia questions.

One player plays X and the other player plays O. Each space on the board is assigned a category. In turn, a player wins the space by answering a trivia question in the category chosen correctly. Each correct answer adds money to the jackpot. The first player to get three of their own symbol in a row wins the jackpot. Stalemates are common, however, and the jackpot keeps building until a winner is declared.

The player with the most money after a set number of games is the winner.

Transogram also released a Junior Edition for pre-teens. Following the scandal concerning rigged quiz shows, which cast a pall over the television industry, the Tic-Tac-Dough games were rebranded as 3-In-a-Row Home Quiz.

The Ideal version, released in 1978, added a solitaire game for the first to get three-in-a-row: the player chooses from nine random cards (six money amounts plus one each of Tic, Tac, and Dragon) one at a time. The player wins additional money by accumulating $1,000 or finding Tic and Tac, but loses if the Dragon is found.

The games are faithful to the television series they are based on.

9334,Ancient Warfare,1998,6.96667,6,2.5,2,8,120,120,Wargames,Ancient Fighting Miniatures Wargame ,,"Ancient Warfare (AW) is a set of miniature rules for wargaming tactical level combat for the period 1500 BC to 450 AD.

1 inch equals 25 yards (for 15mm figures). Each turn equals 5 to 10 minutes. The figure to man ratio is 1:30. For a typical 3 to 4 hour Romans versus Gauls game this will simulate a full legion plus auxiliaries or two under strength legions plus their allies of 6-8,000 men against 8-10,000 Gauls. This equates to 300 to 400 Roman figures (about 100130 elements/stands) and 400 to 500 Gauls (about 130-160 elements/stands).

The rules are published in Letter format (8.5 inches x 11 inches) and consist of:

the main rules,
optional rules section,
ship-to-ship combat rules,
advice on playing AW solo,
advise campaigns,
design concepts,

85 army lists for the period starting with the high chariot-era armies such as Canaanite, Mycenaeans, Hittites and Egyptians and ending with the Huns and Late Imperial Romans.

The rules also come with a quick reference sheet and a pre-printed green order marker sheet. There is no book keeping required, markers and element positioning being used to visually indicate unit status.

An army consists of 2 to 5 Divisions each commanded by a general. Each Division is made up of 2 to 6 units; each unit consists of 2 to 8 elements/stands.

Generals are allowed a certain number of order markers per turn which can be used to initiate tactical moves. Units outside a 12 inch command range need two markers to place an order. An element of randomness is introduced at deployment where the quality of the generals are determined by a set of die rolls with better generals being able to issue more orders. Orders available are Charge, Move, Maneuver (i.e. change face or formation), Defend, Retire, and Recover (from disorder or resupply with missiles). Units without orders may not move but can shoot. An order once issued must be executed, even if it puts the unit in a disadvantageous position. Orders apply for one turn.

Movement is either strategic movement (outside 12 inch /30 cm of enemy) or tactical movement (within 12 inches of known enemy). Troops carrying out strategic movement do not need to expend order markers, the assumption being that they are less nervous and more controllable while they are at some distance from the enemy. Some special formations are allowed:

Locked Shields, which confers an advantage in melee at the expense of speed of movement,

Square, which confers morale and close combat bonus but limited movement,

Testudo is similar to square but only available to Romans, who can move faster than a square,

Wedge allows a close combat advantage, and

Echeloned Line, which allows trained infantry to form a refused line while moving as a line.

Morale and cohesion are closely interrelated in AW. As morale deteriorates so does unit cohesion. Cohesion (and hence morale) is reduced through several causes including terrain, combat, interpenetration or failed morale tests. Units test morale by rolling a D10 die, the result being modified by a series of factors. The test isnt a simple pass/fail test. If a unit fails a test the outcome will depend on how badly the test is failed. A failure by 1 less that the required pass score may result in the unit halting disordered, a failure by 2 results in the unit retiring, and so on. Obviously, the higher the morale grade, the more chance a unit will pass its test.

Units can recover from a deteriorated state. A Recover order marker can be issued to the unit during the Order issue phase. Therefore over time a routed unit can be recovered. Given a limited number of orders available to a player each turn, the player will have to decide whether to charge, maneuver, or recovering units during each turn.

Shooting is calculated by whole elements/stands. An element/stand will hit its target if a D10 die achieves a high enough score. The score necessary to hit depends on the range to target, modified by several shooting factors including the targets armor protection.

Close combat is calculated on a unit-by-unit basis. Weapons, enemy armor, morale, number of ranks fighting, number of elements fighting, combat modifiers plus a random die all contribute to melee calculation. Units that suffer greater losses are pushed back 1 inch and are disordered with the winner usually following up. Units will break through morale failure or, indirectly, through accumulated pushbacks.

Losses in combat or shooting will result in figures being marked as lost. When the figures lost equals the number of figures on an element, the element is removed (there are no individual figures removed in AW, figures are removed in whole-element increments only). Therefore two hits will remove a skirmisher element, three hits will remove a loose order element, four a close order element. A units morale starts to suffer once it loses elements and each whole element loss through shooting or combats triggers a fresh morale test.

A game ends when a player concedes or his army collapses. Collapse becomes possible when an army loses one third of its units; all remaining units being required to take a morale test. This test is retaken in subsequent turns if a further unit is lost.

Ten cards are dealt to each player. You start by drawing the top card of either the draw or discard piles, and end your turn by discarding a card --or by playing nothing and saying Pass (to build up your hand).

You may play tricks of three cards of any event suit to roll the two dice for your piece in that event. Free cards are used to round out incomplete tricks.

If you have a trick on the table from a previous turn, you may add the appropriate Good Start card to it --this gives you an extra roll of the dice. You may also play Bad Start cards on other players' tricks, to prevent them from playing Good Starts (but not from adding tricks).

A player who goes out (played all his cards, with or without discarding) gets a free dice roll in the event of his choice.  The deal then passes left, and both the draw and discard piles are picked up and shuffled anew (as at game start).

No two pieces may occupy the same spot; if you cannot pass, you stop behind.  As pieces pass the finish lines, medals are awarded as appropriate for that event.

Three players: the fourth team isn't used.  Two players: Each player runs two teams; each trick is good for two separate rolls in that event, one per team.

Scoring: Gold is worth 8 points, silver 4 and bronze 2.

Each player leads an expedition on an island that is going to be destroyed soon by a volcanic explosion, to save dinosaurs with their eggs, fossils and cubs.
Everything happening is determined by the videotape: Professor Darmin is at the screen of your tv as if he was at his spaceship window. The succession of events is known, after a few games: but the trick is that what the professor describes happens in the same area where the spaceship pawn is at the moment, so the strategy is to get near to it (or to move it in the most advantageous spot).
The game sold about 32.000 copies in the first year. Authors are Andrea Angiolino, Fabrizio Casa, Luca Giuliano, Massimo Casa, Stefano Giusti and Marco Bardella of the C.UnS.A., or Cooperativa Un Sacco Alternativa: a Roman group of designers. When the game went into print, the publisher cut the names to three since he thought they were too many and erased the name of the team because a company could not be considered an author under its standards.

For example: how do you solve the social-economic-political problems of a rural society?  How do you feed the people?  Build public works?  Collect taxes? Fight wars?  Defend yourself? Revolt?  Grow crops? Accumulate money?  Become powerful?

The variables involved are as numerous as your personality.  And how you move up the social ladder depends on your ability to interact with the other players.

To solve each problem, a specific combination of Resources is needed: laws, money, petitions, media campaign and so on. When a player has the right set, he can go on a ZAT case and roll the die: the result is compared to the difficulty level of the Problem. If he succeeds, he gets a certain amount of Green points. Anyway, he looses all the resources.
The flavor of the game is given by the trading possibilities: players can cooperate, exchanging resources for other ones or for a certain amount of Green points. They can choose to give them for a little amount of points, or to try the die to hope for a larger quantity.
The winner is the one who collects the most Green Points. But if in any moment the map of Italy is totally covered by problems, all the players loose.

Get involved in the challenge of planning our nation's energy reserves.

The Game Equipment consists of the following: a mounted Gameboard; a tri-folded Rules sheet; 1-(6)-sided DIE; 60-Ration Cards; 1-Coupon Disbursement Packet; 6-Various COLOR Ration Coupon Cards; 20-Barter Certificates;  $2,140 in various denominations ($10s,$50s,$100s).

The OBJECT of the Game is to Collect(through buying, selling, bartering, or auctioning), one of EACH of the SAME Color Ration Coupons which are portrayed upon their COLOR Ration Coupon Card. There are various spaces on the gameboard which indicate when a Player can: Collect an amount of Money; Sell, Buy, or Choose a Ration Coupon for some amount of money, BARTER with some other eligible Player, Collect another BARTER Certificate, and on the Supply  Demand spaces-an AUCTION will take place with the Player landing there acting as Auctioneer. There are 2 LARGE Sections of the gameboard designated the Energy Market Place and Coupon Disbursement Center with a canceled Ration Coupons place for when there are less than (6)-Players participating. On each of the COLOR Ration Coupons Cards, there are (3)Sections denoting INDUSTRY, CONSUMER,  GOVERNMENT requirements.      
 To Start the Game, each Player chooses a Color Pawn and a COLOR Ration Coupon Card, which DOES NOT have to BE of the SAME Color as their PAWN, and then picks one of the (4) corners of the BOARD to begin from. The Players are NOT allowed to perform any action depicted in the CORNER space they begin IN.  
 Before starting the Game, MIX  place ALL 60 Ration Coupons within the Packet. Then PICK someone to be the Treasurer and then 3 Ration Coupons are picked from the Packet and placed FACE-UP in the Energy Market Section of the gameboard. The Players are EACH given $200 and starting with the Treasurer(banker), randomly pick (5) Ration Coupons from the Packet, placing ANY identically corresponding ones on his OWN Ration Coupon Card. This is performed until EACH Player is left with (5) Ration Coupons in their hand.

Then the DIE is rolled by EACH Player with the HIGHEST Rolling Player going first, RE-Rolling the DIE and MOVING in a clockwise direction from where they Started,  then performing any Action as dictated by the space they've landed on. This is performed on every TURN so the ORDER in which Players MOVE and CONDUCT any ACTIONS can be different each TURN. When a Player Lands on the Supply  Demand space, they MUST then Auction ALL (3)Ration Coupons one at a time, in the Energy Market Place and can even participate in the Auction, then the next Player can take their Turn. Once the Auctions are completed, then the Energy Market Place is replenished with (3)MORE Ration Coupons picked randomly from the Packet. When a Player lands on a Barter space, he is considered to be the Head Broker for any Barter offers. Bartering can only be conducted between the Head Broker and another Player as long as THAT Player has a Barter Certificate and once concluded, then a Barter Certificate is given up by the BARTERING Player but NOT the Head Broker, and placed back with the Bank. The Head Broker can listen to ALL eligible offers and even REFUSE them if they are insufficient to his desires.

There are 42 cards in the deck - 10 each of 'Granny' cards. 'Elly May' cards and 'Jethro cards and 12 'Jed' cards. The 'Jed cards include two set back cards.

Each player is dealt 10 cards for 2 3 or 4 players, 8 cards with 5 players and 7 cards with 6 players and is given 35 units worth of chips to bet with.

The object of the game is to win the most chips.

When the cards are dealt each player looks at the hand that they have been dealt and then bids on the exact number of tricks that they plan on winning with the dealt hand.

If you win a trick with one of the two 'Jed' set back cards you are allowed to either keep the trick or give it to another player, most often pushing that other players bid over the top.

If you are correct and win exactly the number of tricks that you bid, you win the number of chips equal to that bid, if not, you pay chips equal to your total bid. If you are correct you also score the number of tricks that you bid, if you are wrong you score nothing. The first player to get to 10 points collects all chips remaining.

               For battle group level games 1950-1995

These rules I hope balance playability with the complexity of modern warfare and cover the use of most of the weapon systems in use or likely to be used in the next decade.
The sequence of play is designed to give a fully integrated move and fire system between the players and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of Anti-Tank Guided Weapons. The system is akin to many boardgames and once learned flows as quickly as any alternate move system.
This second edition highlights the increasing use of sophisticated fire control systems as well as other electronic aids on the battlefield, the use of many of which are covered by optional rules.
The main difference from the first edition is in the handling of armour penetration, with the increasing use of composite and active armours. Each armour factor on a vehicle is still 25mm of actual armoured effectiveness at QO slope being taken into account in the thickness, but a 0 factor now represents armour upto about 15mm on light vehicles. The penetration value of weapons is however nearer their true value and a new set of penetration tables and effectiveness charts are used. HESH or HEP are not the super round that it appears in some rules, it has a maximum effective engagement range of 800m, after that you need to start lobbing it using the direct area fire rules. Modern infantry fire stresses volume rather than accuracy and I have therefore considered it a form of area fire and combined it on the same effects table as artillery. In this edition I have also taken the opportunity to reduce the infantry scale to that of a section as was done with the companion Firefly WWII rules.
Helicopters are treated as very fast vehicles and are highly effective but fragile anti-tank vehicles, the full range of their capabilities are covered. Aircraft are an important part of the modern battlefield, but I have limited their impact on the game to direct support of ground elements, although with an increased effectiveness over the first edition.

9393,"Pony Wars, Miniature rules",1980,7.05556,9,3,2,2,180,180,,American West Fighting Miniatures Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Pony Wars, Miniature rules

The grizzled sergeant turns to the young rookie, Listen! The rookie cocks his head to one side I cant hear anything, Sarge. Thats just it came the reply, its quiet, too damn quiet. THUNK! The arrow comes hurtling out of the dark and the sergeant is bowled over backwards by the impact.

But dont worry folks! The arrow is usually stopped by the sergeants pocket book/Water canteen or photograph of his mother. This is surely the stuff that the Hollywood western is made of - and we hope that this is what Pony Wars is also made of!

Forget Realism! Throw accuracy to the four winds! Were not playing Once Upon a Time in the West now! Just put on yar yellow neckerchief, mossey out in yer yellow stripped trousers, boot yer Winchester and climb into the saddle. Raise yar hand and bring it down, pointing forward, at the same time yelling; Column of Twos  Forward, Yo! The entire 7th. cavalry will ride out of Fort Laramie behind you. (Probably to the strains of Gary Owen)
This is Hollywood! Everyones a hero and theres legends to be made. The Sioux are on the warpath and theres white folks out there! As our grizzled sergeant would say: The only good injuns a dead injun.

If your idea of a wargame is to spend time choosing a suitably rigged army and playing with a set of rules which you can corrupt, by pointing out the intricacies of the grammar , with the intention of winning at all costs then, please, put this volume back where you found it and go and find a nice national convention somewhere.
This game is intended for FUN (remember the word? We used it quite a lot before wargaming became serious). The rules are not legally binding, merely suggestions and you wont find every single situation that may occur in this volume. You may have to make a few decisions yourself. If you dont like the result the rules are giving then change them  we dont mind. The idea is to enjoy yourself  do what you will.
The basic concept behind the game is to allow an unspecified number of wargamers (from one upwards) to fight a battle WITH ALL THE WARGAMERS BEING ON THE SAME SIDE (as officers of the U.S. army). Your opponents, the Sioux nation, will look after themselves. The game is ideally suitable for use at a convention where experienced players can teach the rookies (either gamers or the public) the basic rules without any concealed motives  theyre on the same side! Each new command arriving should be allocated to a person picked from the observers, that person taking the name end rank as appropriate to the command. If the character is killed then the player leaves the game. Thus a continually varying clientle is established.
Alternatively, a small group of wargamers can have a great game. Each takes the name and rank of a number of officers. Any new coming commands are either given to new players (if available) or allocated to one of the existing players. There again, Pony Wars makes a great SOLO GAME! We provide suggestions  you do what you want!

The game is designed for an eight foot by six foot table and uses 15mm. figures. There is no reason what so ever why the game should not be adapted for a different size of table

9394,Battles with Micro-Tanks,1975,0,0,0,2,2,10,10,Wargames,Miniatures Wargame World War II ,,"Battles with Micro-Tanks Miniature rules

These rules are designed primarily to permit you to recreate WWII engagements, both small and large scale, using microscale (1:300) units.

The variety of combat situations which occurred during WWII was almost endless. Battles were fought in deserts and mountains, in good weather and bad, with a wide selection of unit types and equipment, and this era therefore offers the wargamer an opportunity to create practically any type of combat situation he desires.

Those rules will allow the wargamer to simulate both small and large scale actions, which retain a high degree of realism, yet are very playable. They permit the players to easily control the large quantity of units sometimes used when gaming in this scale.

The basic ground scale is 1 inch equals 50 yards, and the basic time scale is 1 turn equals 120 seconds. At this particular ground scale, each unit would represent from 4 to 5 actual units, and you may, of course, play this way. However, it was found that using a 1 for 1 vehicle/unit system works out quite well also. For infantry, one (1) 1/2 inch marker, or 1/2 inch base, with 2 or 3 microscale figures mounted on it, represents a 6 to 10 men squad. When an infantry squad is referred to in these rules, this is what is meant.

The equipment lists in the tables describe most of the common pieces of equipment used during WWII. If you wish to use others, it should be a relatively easy procedure to add them, adjusting their values relative to the other equipment.

When playing a micro-armour wargame, it usually works best when a disinterested third party is used to settle all judgment disputes. This will help the game to move quickly, with a minimum of disruption.

Another recommendation which can enhance realism, and can also make the game easier to control, is to maintain some form of unit integrity. There are many references available which can be used to determine the actual composition of the units in question. As a rule of thumb, you can use the following:
3 to 5 units per platoon
3 to 5 platoons per company
3 to 5 companies par battalion. Other specialized types of units may be attached for a given scenario. As a minimum, it is required that you maintain at least company integrity. The farthest any unit can be away from any other unit in the company is 2 inches.

9396,"Fire Fight, Modern skirmish rules",1985,6.25,12,0,2,2,240,240,Wargames,Miniatures Modern Warfare Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Fire Fight, Modern Miniature skirmish rules

These are a comprehensive set of rules for small unit actions since 1945. They are designed to give a playable game whilst recreating the uncertainty of modern warfare, to this end the old fashioned method of drawing chits is used to control initiative whilst for playability the hit chance of some weapons has been reduced, however it still does not pay to advance in the open towards an alert sustain fire machine gun.
With these rules any action from the desperate battles of the Israeli War of Independence as described in 0 Jerusalem, to the siege of Hamburg from the Zone series can be fought, not just those in Vietnam on which many other rules concentrate.
I would like to thank the staff of Heroic Miniatures and Wallasey Immortals Wargame Club for their help in testing the rules.

A game turn is thirty seconds long, composed of a variable number of phases between five and ten seconds depending on the initiative of the troops. The ground scale is one centimeter equals one meter which is near enough one to one for 20mm or 1/76th figures. If you wish to use 1/200th a ground scale of five millimeters to one meter is more appropriate.
