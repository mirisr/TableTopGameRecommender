Each player has twelve checkers on his side of the board.  On his turn, a player may move one checker one square in any orthogonal direction.  Each checker must always be adjacent to one of its teammates, or it is removed from the board.  The further a checker is advanced into enemy territory, the more it scores: the first rank is worth 2 points, the second rank 5 points, and the third rank 8 points.  The winner is the first player to score 16 points.

1600,Russian Roulette,1986,3.25,4,0,2,6,45,45,,Dice ,Betting/Wagering,"Each player selects a different doubles and places a marker on the board to signify that it is his. All players then ante one chip to the jackpot. The first player then takes the dice and rolls and continues to roll until he rolls a 7. Each rolled number is kept track of unless a 7 or doubles is rolled.

If a double is rolled the player who has the double marked adds it to his score and must ante a chip into the jackpot. On a seven the total that the player has rolled is added to his score and a new round is started. If a 7 is rolled by way of a 6 and a 1 the player forfeits his entire score and must ante 1 chip. The first player to achieve a score of 252 or better while it is his turn to roll wins the game and collects the jackpot.

The rules do not assign any significance to the jackpot so I can only think that it is supposed to be a betting game. The rules are provided in English and Spanish.

The track is your standard circular track with movies(properties) and actor, award, dead or alive (chance, community chest) spaces.

As you travel you buy movies.  There are two actors (houses) associated with each movie and upon landing on a actor space you draw three actors for purchase.  Any actors in which you own the corresponding movie you may buy or if non match you may still purchase one card.  Card prices are driven by dice.  If you own both actors for a movie and you land on an award space you can draw to see if you win anything.  If it is a major award (hotel) you place it on the movie and anyone landing there has to pay you a premium.

1610,The Worlds of Boris Vallejo,1984,4.14583,24,1.8,1,6,60,60,,Adventure Fantasy Fighting ,Modular Board,"From the 30 world tiles (each featuring a different painting by Vallejo) each player, 1 at a time, chooses one and places it so that it touches at least 1 other tile. This is done until each player has placed 5 tiles. This makes up the playing board.

Each player then receives 8 cards from the card deck. Cards come in 4 flavors. World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.

Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.

During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.

Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.

Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.

Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there. If a pawn is in a world occupied by another player you would then have a battle. A battle is fought between the cards on the tile as defense and the cards from the attacking players hand. Calls from allies can be made and other players can contribute to the battles as well.

The first player to control 8 worlds wins.

Players take on the roles of the major characters from the book (Frodo, Gandalf, Sauron, etc.).  The large paper board is a representation of Middle Earth with various paths on it.  Players move along the paths using standard die rolls, conducting combat when opposing pieces cross each other.  Spaces on the board (Bree, Entdowns, etc.) are havens or hazards for different players.  The Fellowship players win if they get the Ring to the Crack of Fire, or destroy the Dark Tower (Sauron's fortress) through combat.  Sauron wins if he brings the ring or Ringbearer to the Dark Tower.  Saruman wins if he brings the Ringbearer to the White Tower.

The game is played on an 8x8 board, with each player controlling one King pawn. On your turn, you must move your King (as a normal chess king) and then place a pyramid on the board. Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.

Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a  symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover. Even the rules for the game are printed on the back of the box (in English  German) as opposed to being included on a separate sheet inside.

1639,Archie Bunker's Card Game,1972,5.22222,18,2,2,4,30,30,,Card Game Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Trick-taking,"This is a simple Oh Hell! variant. There are four suits -- Archie, Edith, Gloria, and Mike -- of 10 cards each, plus two special cards. Players use their Ding Bat Tally wheel to predict how many tricks they will take that hand of 7 cards. If they're right, they score 10 points. You must follow suit if possible; if not, Archie cards are trumps. The two special Ding Bat cards, which are ranked 0 and 11 in the Archie suit, allow the trick's winner to give the trick to any other player, or keep it for himself, allowing for some opportunistic hose-age of one's opponents.

From the box:
A Message from Archie: In my neighborhood, we ain't much for playing Contact Bridge or cannestoga or any other leftist games, so we play my card game. Even Edith plays it, so ya know it's gotta be real simple to learn. Meathead plays it too, but he's got trouble counting so we gotta stop to coach 'im. I highly recompense this Ding Bat card game for all youse right-thinkin' Americans.

The message comes with the following disclaimer: The above quotation from 'Archie' is printed the way he talks on the famous 'All in the Family' TV Show. It is not intended to be correct English.

1658,Police State,1976,4.4,5,1,2,8,120,120,,,,"A game of strategy, survival, power and wealth

This is a sort of communist Monopoly.  The players go around the board, but which leg of the board they're allowed on depends on how far they've risen in the hierarchy yet.  The most visible status symbol is your apartment size --and the competition for the one and only full-size Dacha can be ferocious.  There are a number of other status perks, such as use of the State Car.  All in all, a very amusing game that actually does capture a fair amount of the flavour of life in the communist USSR before its fall.

The game was invented by Harley Sachs in 1969 under the name POLICE STATE, and sold in England and the USA, even as far as Ireland and South America.  It was copyrighted, patented, and published by the IDEA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (IDEVCO), licensed by Gameophiles and later by the L.A. Producers' Partnership under the name COMRADES.

Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks (ABZ, NBZ, ZBS, IND), and the goal is to have the most money when the game ends (which is either when only one network is left on the air, or when certain tiles run out).

Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events: drawing an event card, auctioning off a new TV show or star or academy award movie, or triggering a ratings war. During a ratings war, players lay out the tiles representing their prime-time lineup of shows and movies, along with bonuses for stars and reviews.

1704,Attacke,1977,0,0,0,2,4,45,45,Wargames,Bluffing Wargame ,,"A game of strategy with bluff and tactics for 2-4 players whose object is to eliminate all other players.

At first glance, this is a Risk knock-off. A closer look reveals a different game.

For starters, each of the 42 lands can only be occupied by a single token, which act more as visual aids than as armies per se. Combat is card--driven, each player playing from a hand of five cards. There are Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry cards, of various values; you're allowed to play up to one of each kind when attacking or defending. Joker cards can substitute for any given type. You can play your entire hand of five cards if you wish, but you only draw two per turn, so this could leave you exposed.

Treason cards allow you to take over a non-contiguous land; Desertion cards allow you to get army cards from another player. The Revolution cards are very powerful as they will take over an entire continent! Luckily, there are Counter-Revolution cards in the deck as defense.

A refreshing change from Risk, and certainly playable in a lot less time.

1733,Iago,1972,6.53571,14,2,2,2,30,30,,Word Game ,,"The perfidious game of confrontation in which two players steal words and time from each other.

The Game In Brief:
The letter-tiles are blue on one side and red on the other. One player enters words with the blue side up, the other with the red side up. At each move the object is to take the lead and end up with at least one more tile on the board then ones opponent. But words entered on the board are by no means permanent-they may be stolen-which is indeed the main point of the game. Whenever a player is able to change both the form and the meaning of an opponents word, by substituting one or more letters in the word and/or by adding letters to either end, that player may steal it by turning over all its letters, so a previously blue word becomes a red one, or vice-versa.

The game ends when a player is unable to take the lead on his turn and over-steps the time-limit.

Revised version:

     Vice Versa (the games appear to be extremely similar but not identical)

Cows caught in the rain (i.e. are not in the stables or under a tree) catch a cold and cannot eat in the next turn. If there is dry wind (after a sunny turn), new grass grows. Wind after rain also damages the cattle's health.

The game has a push your luck element - which locations are safest while offering good grazing grounds? The stables are safe, but the cows don't get fat.

When all eighteen events have been played, the player with most grass chips is the winner.

Ogres see the world as one long series of meals: enemies mean lunch or breakfast. Depending on the time of day. More often than not, Ogre duels are vast eating competitions. Although violent brawls make a good substitute. As enemies, Ogres are ruthless foes who show no mercy once their appetite has been whetted. Anyone brave enough to do battle with Ogres must be sure of their own fighting prowess. Otherwise, they might not end up just dead, theyll end up as someones dinner!    Ogres are not evil as such. Just permanently hungry and frighteningly violent. Often they just wander about alone. At other times they group together in clans led by an Ogre Lord, also known as a Tyrant. These are some of the meanest, nastiest and hungriest of all Ogres. It is possible for both the Empire and the forces of Chaos to hire Ogres as mercenaries, so long as they are guaranteed a good time, a brawl and plenty to eat (usually as a result of the fighting). But their habits make them unpredictable and horribly dangerous.

As the rain lashed down and thunder rumbled across the sky, a brief flash of lightning illuminated a bedraggled group of travelers. Their slow climb up the rocky slopes to the foreboding tower at the summit seemed to last an eternity. At last the figures escaped the storm and entered a dark hallway. As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a rocky throne. A solitary traveler stepped forward from the huddled and dripping group and addressed the presence on the throne. My lord Morcar, we come bearings grave tidings. We must report the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once again we were routed by his accursed Champions and once again we were forced to flee. The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the silence. I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have learned from my failures. Firstly I have learned not to underestimate the Emperors Heroes. Secondly, I have learned not to rely on fools. I have therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperors Heroes forever. I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my Lieutenants. With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows. Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako. An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue. Fanrax, the Malicious. At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group. Boroush, the Storm Master. With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees. And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes. The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party. I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure. With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows. From here he watched with great satisfaction as his four sorcerous Lieutenants erased all trace of Festral and his followers. Mocar smiled. These were indeed the ones who would finally destroy the Emperors Heroes forever.

Right answers win money, wrong ones lose it. At several points throughout the game, players are offered the chance to buy discounted merchandise using the money they have built up. The catch is that no player knows just how valuable the item is, only that it is offered at less than full value. After fifteen questions, the player with the most money can either buy a more expensive prize with their winnings, or keep their money in hopes of winning again, and being able to buy something even better. After each person has had a chance to host, the player with the most money and merchandise is the winner.

Two editions were made of the original 1969-74 series, although the first was reprinted (in 1971?) with an altered cover: one prize was changed to a TV, and the set shot cuts off the left side (where the host is) in favor of another prize.

Scarlet Empire took place in a different period in that game's world, and further to the south of the original map.  It was designed as a stand alone game that could also be played in combination with the other one.  The campaign game pits most of the players against the one playing the Scarlet Witch King.

If you liked Divine Right, you'd like Scarlet Empire -- everything that made the first game great is also present in the other.  Mercenaries, special locations, diplomacy, magic, etc.

Scarlet Empire was supposed to be published by Excalibre Games and made it as far as the advanced play-test stages, but the publisher hemmed and hawed and tried to cut costs, so much so Glen eventually gave up in disgust.  A very few play-test copies are in existence as a result.

The mechanics are mostly borrowed from Nuclear War: you play food cards followed by fart cards.  The damage to the target's fresh air points is the product of the two card values.  Upon having to leave the room because you ran out of fresh air, you get an act of ultimate flatulence: firing off all remaining food and fart card pairs.

The only parody of Magic here is the title. The game is a variation of Nuclear War, The food cards are the warheads and the Phart cards are the delivery system.  There is no propoganda-peace phase though.

Sacrificing to the gods or consulting the Oracle can help or hinder you in war or trade.  Your nation has a ruling dynasty, and if you have daughters and sons to marry, the more power to you.  One can even mount a raid on another player in order to kidnap his daughter!

Combat is simple, and the overrun rule maybe a little too powerful.

There is a companion game called Troy which is concerned with the siege of Troy.

    Buys cards from the display (using an 8, for example, to buy a 5 and 3, or an 8, or all three cards)
    Builds a pile of cards (by adding or subtracting the card played with a card or pile already on the table, or vice versa)
    Plays to the table (making the card available for piles or buys on future turns)




After players play out the few cards in their hand, they receive a few more cards. After a certain number of rounds, the game ends and players sum the points of the cards they've collected, earning additional points for collecting the most cards and for buying all cards on display during a turn.

At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a Doomsday date in the month of December, 1999 (play commences on December 1st, and each turn is one day long). From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or deprogram (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.

When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds. If you do successfully end the world, you win; if you fail, you pick a new Doomsday and start gathering a Flock again; if the world hasn't ended by January 1st, 2000, everybody loses.

Dexterity game with a bit of memory

Players: 2-4
Ages: 6 and up
Duration: 15-20 minutes
Bits: 36 cups in 3 different sizes and 4 colors

Setup:
All cups are placed on the table. Players put together a mix of different colors under their largest cups. Each player then grabs a set of the largest cups of one color. With 2 or 3 players, only use 2 or three colors.

Object: To only have your own color under your cups.

Game Course:
The starting player chooses a player, and points to one of his cups. He then says something like, The smallest cup in that stack is my color. (He may also choose  the middle sized cup in the stack.

The player spoken to uncovers the named cup.

If the guess is correct, the player receives the cup of his color, and gives the other player a cup of the same size from beneath one of his cups. Both sets of cups are uncovered visibly so that all players may see what is beneath them.

The players may then shuffle their cups to try to obscure which cup was just revealed.

A player who made a correct guess goes again. He may choose a stack from the same player, or of a different player. A player can keep going as long as he is right. Once the player misses his guess, then the player whose cup he was guessing takes the next turn.

Mixing cups:
Whenever a player has to reveal his cups, he is allowed to mix them. Players who have not shown their cups are NOT allowed to mix theirs.

Each player may peek under his own stacks secretly at any time.
End of Game:
The game ends when any one player has only his own color cups under his stacks.

1868,Conquistador,2001,5.125,8,2.25,2,4,60,60,,Card Game Economic Renaissance ,,"A simple card game of empire-building rivalry.

There are some 15 territory cards rated 1 through 3, some of which are dealt out to the players at the start (each gets a 1 and a 2 territory).  There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.

When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1, 2 or 3) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.

Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.

Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.

Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.

A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.  The cards are printed in French, English and Dutch.

It is good strategy to build your hand for the end game, so you can, for example, protect a territory with a Revolt, then unprotect it, redeploy Development cards with a strong Cannon, and complete the territory's development with your last few card plays.

The game board is constructed by the players at the start of the game.  During the setup, initial terrain tiles are placed (mostly face down) starting at the center of the board and moving out in rings (similar to Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)).  Only a portion of the tiles are uncovered at the start and the board is different every game.

Players bid for starting areas and play begins.  
Players search (or discover) terrain (similar to the search process used in 2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt).  This phase also allows players to apply various counters that affect terrain (help themselves or hurt other players) and to discover mines.
Then players use labor that they have procured to build tracks.
Finally, players get paid.  If a player has track to a mine, the railroad services the mine and collects income.  Coal mines pay the least and Gold mines pay the most.

But watch out for the Dalton Boys or the Clinton gang.

Meanwhile becomes the characters better on fighting and defending themselves against monsters, guardians and opponents.
You play two different fractions and with more than two you play co-operative. According to the rules one player should be an administrator if you are 3 or 5 players! Probably it's best to play with 2 players.
The combat system is pretty complicated, with a lot of dice rolls.
There's an expansion (expert game) with some more monster quest cards, money tokens, but most important character dial-boards with all statistics about the characters, so you don't need to use paper and pen for this.

Twenty-eight cards 
An A4 sheet of rules 
a piece of cardboard 
You have to provide your own money and 'Spit' tokens. 
packaged in an envelope

The end of the world is nigh.  The only commodity left is ... camels!
The Future. Camels. Space Bucks. You.

A dangerous combination. Can you assemble the most impressive herd of camels?
It's the future, and camels are more valuable than gold or any other commodity for that matter. You've got money to burn and camels to buy in this quick bidding game. While quantity is important, it's camel quality that really counts. Will you put your money into the single-hump Arabian or Saharan Dromedary? Or do you prefer the more exotic two-humped Bactrian? Such is the nail biting excitement.
All the other animals have died and all you can buy are camels. There are three types and they come in groups of one to four. The cards are then numbered 1 to 9, the higher the number, the more camels. Your camels are worth more if you have the largest herd (most cards of a type), a train (sequence of three or more) or a 'Big Three' (three cards of the same number). All in all it's difficult to know how much cards are worth - but that's what makes for a good bidding game.

Bidding is just one round, so the last bidder has a big advantage. The only way to counter this is by 'Spitting' . You play your spit token and get an extra bid after the last bid. You can only do this once. Once all the spit tokens are played, you're left calculating how much money players have got left . The player purchasing the last card, bids first in the next round. This player enjoys the title of Space Merchant
The winner is the person who has the most money when the game ends!

Players weave their webs of influence through the company, starting from the bottom and spreading through the connections among departments.  To establish control over a department, a player must spend kudos (the game's currency) and he or she must outspend other players with similar interests.  Each player also has a deck of cards that can help them to establish control, or to hinder others from doing so.  Each controlled department gains the player income; higher level departments yield more kudos.

Once a player controls twelve departments, he or she is declared the winner and the game ends.

It is played on a 3x3 or 3x4 board with a supply of red, yellow, and green markers. The object is to get a line of three of the same color.

On each turn, you may do ONE of the following:

(1) Put a red counter in an empty square.
(2) Replace a red counter with a yellow one.
(3) Replace a yellow counter with a green one.

So ultimately the board will fill with green counters.

From the Publishers website:

Salamis, one of the most famous naval battles in history, was a direct result of the Persian need to keep their large, invading army supplied by controlling the sea lanes. With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.

With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.

At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.

To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.

There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This action appears to have been a stand off, with both sides blockading and not fighting.

At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.

The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.

Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.

The game board shows the pathway to 7th Heaven divided up into many spaces. Each player takes a partner figure and places it on the start space. The 6 partner cards are shuffled and each player takes one - this card shows which partner you want/need in order to get into the 7th heaven. (Partners are not the fellow players at the table - but the chosen partner card of the same color as the wooden piece).

Each player is dealt 12 sympathy cards. These cards are played on your turn and are used to move or exchange a partner figure. There are 3 different types of sympathy cards: the cards with the numbers are used to move the corresponding colord figure on the board; the cards with an arrow moves the corresponding piece forward to the space of another playing piece; finally the cards with the text are played and the actions carried out immediately.  Alternatively, each numbered or arrowed sympathy card can be used to exchange partner cards with another player.

The game starts with a player playing a numbered Sympathy Card and moving the corresponding piece forward that number of spaces, then drawing a new card. The next player then takes his turn, etc. Play continues in this manner - moving or swapping pieces until a player is able to get to the finish (7th Heaven) while holding the correct colored partner card for his playing piece. If no-one makes it to 7th Heaven, the game ends when the last sympathy card is played. The winner in that case is the player with the correct partner card who is closest to 7th Heaven.

Goal
Getting as many points as possible by collecting egg cards and avoiding cards with fried eggs.

Game play
The 12 egg cards are put into a stack.
The other cards (in four colours, each with values 1-24) are shuffled if the game is played with 8 players. If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.

The start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.

When all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.

If nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control. If any cards have been revealed, the player with the highest card takes over control.
The player in control can choose between

     continuing
     ending the round
     doubting a player.




If the player in control continues, the same colour stays active and all players put a second card on top of the previous.
If the player in control ends the round, the biggest liar is determined: the unrevealed cards are revealed and the player who played the highest card in the called colour gets an egg card. Then all played cards are put into a stack next to the player.
If the player in control doubts a player, that player has to reveal his/her played card. If it is of the called colour, the doubted player must take all the played cards. If the player in control incorrectly doubts a player (i.e. they played a card in a different colour), the doubter must take all the played cards. Some cards have fried eggs printed on them, which count as negative points.

The game ends when the last card has been played.
Each egg card is worth 3 points, each fried egg on one of the cards a player has received counts as -1. After five games, all points are added up and the player with the most points wins the game.

1955,Star Wars Episode I: Attack on Naboo,1999,3.53125,16,1,2,4,45,45,,Dice Fighting Movies / TV / Radio theme Science Fiction ,Partnerships,"4 armies are fighting to be the first to reach Queen Amidala on the green planet Naboo, to get her to one of their own bases.

The armies are 2 different teams: The Good ones and the Evil ones. Each player control one army (or sometimes 2 if you are 2-3 players) and tries to move any of his characters to Naboo, throwing 2 dices per turn, each for one character. When getting doubles, all four characters can be moved. On the way can you attack your opponents and with luck and skill render them harmless. But be careful, so your not attacked and eliminated yourself.

Armies from the same side are allies during the game and has to cooperate, ie to open a gate to Naboo, as the planet is protected by a shield. It's done when 2 allies from different armies meet at an alliance field, where 'Star Wars' is stated. Throwing 4 dices and adding attack value, they must get at least 22. Enemies cannot go trough the opened gate.

The combat system is simple, by adding attack values and defence values of each character to the dice throws. Regardless who attacked, the player who got smaller number, loses the character. The lost character can be conquered back if ventured in the enemy base and both characters are moved back to own base.

When character reaches Queen Amidala, player takes control of it and tries to move it back to allied base. If Queen loses battle, the winning character is moved to center and control of the Queen is changed.

The game is based upon the the movie Star Wars Episode I.

The game does probably only exist in Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Kampen om Naboo = Fight for Naboo.

After a robbery you and the other robbers try and get the most loot from the haul. There are master thieves, pickpockets and thieves cards and 1-8 numbered value cards in a deck of 112 cards.

The game uses matching of cards to raid your opponents loot and has an element of role selection as you can use cards to choose to raid another player or the discard pile. The mechanism involves using your cards matching them and plundering points from other players. For example the master thief card allows you to steal a pile of loot from another player, the pickpocket allows you to get a card from an opponents hand. The game ends when the draw pile is empty.

This was a shameless attempt to capitalize on the Quebec question, which has dominated Canadian politics recurrently in the last century --and shows no sign of being over yet.  At least Waddingtons got a decent game out of it instead of a propaganda tool like some of the others.  It doesn't seem to have stayed long in the catalog, for some reason.

The puzzle-cut board shows the provinces, and each player plays a provincial premier.  Each turn, you try to attract foreign investment and to weather the ups and downs of the economy.  If you are a federalist, you join your board piece with other federalists'; otherwise, you separate.  Going separately increases the benefits when they happen, but makes it a lot harder to survive the bad turns of events.  Each player can make demands for concessions every turn --according to his own agenda-- which, if pushed for too hard, run the risk of seeing him expelled from the confederation.  Ah, politics!

Haven't tried it yet, but a quick reading of the rules leaves me sorely tempted to do so.  It looks like this one requires a nearly full complement of players (nine) to be truly enjoyed.

The unique game VOTUM allows you to play the exciting role of a party leader, who might belong to the generation of the grandsons of the present-day greats. 
Votum is a fast and talkative, sometimes loud and often clever game: it requires decisive bargaining, a little luck, and, above all, else the gift of negotiation. 
Each player is responsible as the trustworthy chairman of a political party, whom he leads through three legislative sessions, that is, game rounds. During each session, five elections take place followed by the formation of the government. The goal is to advance as far as possible in the parliament. Advancement comes, on the one hand, through luck (namely, your cards) and the way you use it, that is, playing the right cards at the right time, and, on the other hand, through skillful negotiation with your fellow players about posts and their related points. 
Success is measured in points. Each player has a sixth of the game field (the plenary hall) in front of him, his points are marked in the track of his color. After 15 elections, the strongest party-chairman wins; that is, the one with the most points.

The magicians have three movement possibilities. In each round a movement can occur in only one of these three ways.

2. With his own magician he may jump over an adjacent game stone, whether it is his own or his opponents, or a magician or a wisdom. 
Multiple jumps are allowed. Also one can change direction during such a jump.

3. The magician moves between Space and Time. If one's magician stands at the board's edge, so one can move out from the square and emerge on the opposite side of the board again. A player can push another piece over the edge to the other side.

It is not allowed, to move figures off the edge of the board and back to their old places.

One can move magicians through fire spaces and they may also stand there. One's own wisdoms may not be pushed in the fire. Foreign wisdoms are burnt immediately, taken from the game and immediately scored.

Scoring is determined by the opponents wisdoms, which are pushed in the flame fields. The points are indicated on the scales at the board edge.

As soon as a player has burnt wisdoms of the adversary that are worth five points, the game is finished and the appropriate player is victorious. Return to Main Email me.

Then players take turns moving their pawns until only one colour remains.

This is the lay of the land.

This is the nature of the people who reside upon it.

In the mountains live the people called the Neemahk. Who wear the thick woolly skins of the tiger and mammoth, and carry spears tipped with sharp, shiny, black rock. They are fierce warriors. But even better hunters.

A day's journey downriver, at the edge of the forest there, live the men who call themselves the Treg. They have learned to reap the bounties of the water. They harvest
the river with nets woven of soft, pliable reeds and roots; and make stories out of symbols painted on hides.

On the broad open plains to the south live the Marmar. Who plant seeds, and raise animals for work and food. They are a peaceful people, desiring only to be left alone. And the strong walls they have built around their village do much to help them maintain their solitude.

Lastly are the Dermen, who are a tribe of raiders. They know the land well, being so traveled -- getting direction from the patterns in the stars. They go wherever the warmth of the sun and the wealth of nature lead them. And if they cannot find food enough for themselves, they simply take it... from others.

Welcome to the World of Nomad...

Nomad is a game based on the life and times of the early tribal societies at the dawning of the Neolithic Age. It is the story of their growth and expansion, their struggles against the elements of a harsh and unforgiving, prehistoric world, full of rivals and predators; every day, a walk through the borderlands between perseverance and
extinction.

As the chieftain of one of these early tribes, it will be your job to make the decisions that lead your people to prosperity. Will you lead them into the new era, or will
you simply become history?

In a space dock you build up starships. Cards represent prows and poops, and everything in between --missile launchers, laser turrets, shuttles...Special prizes appear as pairs of cards; should you be lucky enough to draw both halves and play them side by side, it is worth more. Each of these prizes is worth even more if played in the same starship as a specific accompanying card.

At any point, you have to choose between closing a starship (and scoring) or building it up some more. In addition, complete starships can attack the other player's starships...

There is little control in this game, as the players simply draw then place cards - but there's still some reasonable amount of strategy in the placements. The simplicity makes it accessible to children, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults as a light, quick game.

The board is 9x9 with the corners clipped; the middle row is made out of deeper pockets.  Each player controls two cue balls; in addition, there are 10 neutral balls, moved by the cue balls.  The object is to maneuver five neutral balls into the pockets (once there, they are removed for score).

On your turn, you pick a cue ball and launch it in one of eight possible directions.  Your cue ball may travel any distance in a straight line before hitting a neutral (or another cue ball); at that moment, its momentum is transferred and the ball hit moves the same distance.  Should you hit a row of balls, only the farthest one moves (as in a Newton's Cradle).  All balls bounce off the play area's walls, either straight back when hitting head on, or reflected when hitting at 45 degrees.  Note that a move that doesn't hit any balls is illegal.

Includes solitaire problems where the object is to find the least number of moves required.

2062,Deal Me In,1988,6.30769,13,0,2,4,45,45,,Card Game ,Set CollectionTile Placement,"Briefly: Scrabble with poker hands.

Deal Me In is a board game in which players collect tiles (which represent playing cards) and attempt to lay them on the board so as they form poker hands. The higher the hand, the greater the score. The poker hands interlock in the same way as the words on a scrabble board, so it`s possible to score for more than one hand on a turn. When a player scores, he/she takes score chips from the box. the player with the highest scoring number of chips when the cards run out is the winner.
Simple, fast and fairly enjoyable; but very lightweight. An opener/closer.

The bits: One board, comprising an 11x11 grid. most of the spaces are blank, but some have representations of playing cards on them; these are bonus squares, a la scrabble.

56 playing cards. These are actually good quality cardboard tiles.

30 No Entry tiles.

4 playing racks

Poker chips in various denominations

Each player starts with chips worth 150 and 7 tiles. These are placed in the playing rack.
the four joker tiles are laid on the Joker squres on the board.

Players must, on their turn lay at least one card on the board to form a legitimate poker hand, or failing that change one or more tiles at a cost of 10 per tile.

Tiles laid must extend hands already played, again in the same way as scrabble. 
Players do not have to lay five cards at a time. For example, a player could form four of a kind simply by laying three tiles of the same denomination next to a previous tile with that denomination.

bonuses are scored by laying tiles on the special bonus squares on the board. Again, these squares have representations of playing cards on them and in order to score, you must lay the tile of the same denomination as the bonus square in order to score.
When a five card poker hand has been formed on the board, it can no longer be extended, so a No Entry tile must be laid at either end of the hand to stop any further tiles from being added.
If a hand is played so it covers a Joker tile, this tile is taken up and added to the players` hand.
If a Joker is laid as part of a hand, it may be replaced with the correct tile which it represents on a later turn.
When a player lays a hand down, he/she takes poker chips to the value of the hand. This varies from 10 for a pair, to 1000 for a royal flush.
When the cards run out, scores are totted up and the player with the highest value in chips is declared the winner.

So I envisioned one big map showing the planets orbiting around, then a bunch of little maps showing the players' satellites orbiting the different planets, trying to blow the other guy's satellites out of orbit so they can claim the natural resources of that planet for themselves.

As in Monopoly, players roll dice to move around the outside board edge. Other similarities include an extra turn when doubles are rolled, two decks of cards (Production and Exploration), income tax, income upon passing the start space and even incorporation of the unofficial Free Parking variant, here called the Slush Fund.

Different is an interior board path and an elevated 6x6 drilling board. Landing on an outer board space usually offers the chance to lease a plot on the drilling board if not already leased. Travel on the interior board, possible only by landing exactly on its entrance or possession of a plastic permit token (obtained by landing on other spaces), permits drilling once one has a drilling company. This is very much a costly hit-and-miss affair, especially when drilling without any other proven oil fields nearby.

If the player does not go bankrupt, eventually his plots should be populated with a lot of black plastic pegs indicating gushers rather than the yellow ones which signify dry holes. Then each time a player passes the start, he is paid based on the number of barrels he is pumping.

Unlike Monopoly, the idea is not to drive others into bankruptcy, but to be the first to reach one million dollars. While there is a good atmosphere of real drilling situations, there is also much chaos in the dice, cards and spinner.

Building coal mines involves building rails through coal mine spaces which causes a load of coal to be available at the nearest coal city.  Since West Virginia is naturally mountainous, the competition for the best routes is extremely competitive, even in a two-player game.

Players take turns rolling one die, moving the corresponding number of steps: 
- if they are carrying a ring, they move towards the exit
- if they are not carrying a ring, they move towards the center of the cave. 
When two dwarves meet and one is carrying a ring and the other isn't, the one whose turn it is kicks the other one out of the cave (stealing his ring first, if applicable). 
Whenever a 1 is rolled, the dragon laughs. The active player then rolls two dice to determine two or more fields (such as 31 and 13, for instance - special rules apply for rolling doubles). All dwarves on these fields lose their rings and are kicked out of the cave. The first player who carries two rings out of the cave is the winner.

The game is entirely dice driven, there is no decision-making involved.

The three dimensional board is made up of 11 rows (circles) and a middle pit. The first 6 rows are safe and each player has their own along with a pit for prisoners. There are then 5 circular rows that anybody can move into and a pit in the middle for scoring.  To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.

When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over. Each piece captured is worth 5 points and each piece in the middle pit is worth 10 points.

You clobber enemy pawns by landing on them --they're sent back to their home space.

The winner is the first player to place his pawns on their arrival spaces (by exact count).

(The board consists of a three-lobed track; it touches the central star circle at its three innermost points.  The player home/start spaces are arrayed around the outside of the track, whilst the ending circles are inside the track (but each uses an outer circle's exit space as its entry space).

Is the porcelain vase really from the Ming Dynasty or from Joe Bob's Ceramic Creations?  Can you tell?  If you think a seller is a black-hearted pirate, you can challenge the scoundrel.  If you're right you get the goods for free!  But, if you wrongfully accuse an honest merchant, you will pay dearly.  What's your selling style?

The object of the game is to make money.  You do this by renting spaces and selling your Big Deal cards.  Once a player has sold all of his Big Deal cards, it's Closing Time --any Big Deal cards leftover in other players' hands are deducted from their score.

Big Deal cards are displayed for all to see during play, with the Fair Price hidden on the back.  There are duplicates of each item, with sometimes wildly different fair prices.  Sets of four Big Deal cards of the same colour can be cashed in when passing the Wholesaler (Start Space).  You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.  The agreed-upon price is multiplied by the number of cards of that colour the buyer already holds (but never more than four times).

If you think the seller was asking for more than the Fair Price, you may call a Challenge.  You are secretly shown the Fair Price to resolve the challenge.  If you were right, you get the card; otherwise, you must pay the Fair Price multiplied by *twice* the number of cards of that colour you already hold.

Of course, role-playing (haggling) is encouraged.

In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay in check. The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.

The Community Chest/Chance cards have been replaced by Spot Market and Commodity Exchange decks, which are used to simulate a player's speculating on the spot market.  A key difference from Monopoly is that you can build up your military and use it as an alternate means of conquest.

The back of the box gives the following description:

Elves, Dwarfs and Dungeonbowl contains 32 finely - sculpted plastic models - complete Elf and Dwarf Blood Bowl teams - plus rules and components for Dungeonbowl, a Blood Bowl variant sponsored by the Colleges of Magic.

Dungeonbowl as its name suggests, is played in a Dungeon.  The teams move about using teleporters, and must begin the game by searching for the ball hidden in one of the trapped chests scattered throughout the Dungeon.  Once the ball has been found, there's a furious battle for possession - the first team to score a touchdown wins, so the game is hard-fought and fast pace.

2292,Rubicon,1990,2.4,5,0,3,6,45,45,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Economic Negotiation ,Roll / Spin and MoveTrading,"Players roll a die to move towards Rome (26 spaces forward), when the last player crosses the river Rubicon (10 spaces from Rome) the round ends, and everybody in Rome shares the money in the pool.

Players can make deals that either forces them not to move next turn, or that forces them to move next turn. Players that have not entered a deal have to move.

Whenever a player crosses the Rubicon, they pick up a card that can; affect movement (of their own and/or of opponent pieces), end the round prematurely, negate other cards that might be played, or nullify deals.

The game does not mention if you can keep cards from round to round, and does not mention how many rounds a game lasts (or in fact how the game ends).

Cards are played in a series of tricks, with the highest black card always taking a trick. The highest numbered red card also takes a trick if only red cards are played. Players need not follow suit. Cards - both negative and positive - are actually worth their face value at the end of the game, with the highest scoring player (after deducting negative points from positive points) the winner. The 48 cards in this older German game each have unique artwork with the numbers incorporated into fanciful, colorful animal drawings.

2305,Murder Mystery Party: Revenge in Rome,1985,5.4,5,2,6,6,60,60,,Deduction Murder/Mystery Party Game ,Role PlayingStorytelling,"Games in the Murder Mystery Party series are a throwback to the parlor games of medieval Europe. Guests assume their roles and stay in character throughout the party in an attempt to solve the murder.  All guests are given information to read privately which reveals their motives and hidden pasts. A lively cross-examination should ensue.  All players must answer questions truthfully, but are not required to provide more information than asked.  An exception is the murderer who may lie freely. Accusations are made at the conclusion of the final chapter, the winner being the player who guesses the author's solution correctly.  The setting of this particular mystery is Rome in the year 1985 where an American citizen has been found dead in one of the catacombs. The roles in the game are the son of the deceased, the son's wife, the wife's parents, the secretary of the deceased and the   lawyer of the deceased. A 33 and a third phonograph record is included to provide a sense of atmosphere.

Some bite - they have a magnet that is attracted to some (not all) of the frogs - others just lie still.  Flowers are collected as an antidote to snake bites.
Players can move a cat each turn instead of a frog. No frog would dare walk past a cat, so they are placed in the way of frogs to hold them up and allow or prevent the theft of a book.

2309,Noah's Ark,1986,4.75,4,2,2,4,45,45,,Nautical ,Modular BoardPick-up and DeliverSet Collection,"This game is a distant relative of Survive! which introduces a number of interesting twists.

You are Noah's helpers and are competing to bring the best variety of animals on board before the waters rise too much.  The board and bits are very nice plastic, except for the animals which are cardboard (and whose bases tend to fray after a while).  There is a big Ark sitting in the middle of the board that acts as a four-slotted piggy bank.  A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.

The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.

You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an expedition to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two berth spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.

Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.

As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.

The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.

Be the first player to to make a word using ALL of the cards in your hand. The dealer decides how many this is, from 3 to 8, and can change from one hand to the next. The more cards that you deal, the more challenging the play. If, for example, the dealer deals 5 cards, then only words with 5 letters can be made. 
Each letter in that word is then worth a certain number of points, giving you a score for that hand. 
The first player to reach a pre-determined score wins.

The game has elements of a Trivia game to it, as you must often recognize an illness from a list of symptoms and remember the appropriate cure (if any).  This lowers the replay value somewhat, but the game does have an educational vocation, so this is excusable.

The expansion adds no new card types, but doubling the number of available cards makes the game much easier to play.  In the original game, especially with 4 players, the late game could sometimes stall as there weren't enough resources for the players to drive to a win.  The additional cards prevent this stall and add many options to the game.  They also bring in almost every iconic Groo character, event, and location.

2355,The Artifact,2001,7.6875,16,4,3,8,120,120,,Adventure Deduction Expansion for Base-game Negotiation Science Fiction ,Grid MovementRole PlayingSecret Unit DeploymentSimulationSimultaneous Action SelectionVariable Player Powers,"Description from the publisher:

THE ARTIFACT is a space opera using the Last Frontier: The Vesuvius Incident game system (published  by Fat Messiah Games). Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.

The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.

Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.

The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.

Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.

The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon. The action never falters until the last lifeboat is away, the final alias revealed, and the last storeroom explored.

2360,Sekt oder Selters,1992,6.5,6,0,2,4,30,30,,Dice ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Theme
Lola's Bar is very popular and crowded. The way to the counter is long, and everyone else is trying to get there too in order to get the best drinks. Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.

Goal
Collecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.

Game play
The board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine (Sekt) or soda (Selters). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.
On each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). 
Sparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.
If you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).
If you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.
There can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.

The game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.

The Barons of Fyn is a card based strategy game in which competing players each try to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn.

The Great King Timothy has decided he will leave his kingdom, Fyn, and fight in the great crusades.  While he is gone, he trusts the nobility of the land will behave themselves, as good nobles should.  Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.

The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.  The standard game is played until King Timothy returns to Fyn, at which point, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.

Do you have what it takes to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn?

The game features a dynamic board that is generated as the players lay land cards; however, instead of a Kings-and-Things style board, this one combines some features of Illuminati, in the sense that each player's layout is independent of the others', except that when a group of cards is captured, the entire group is slid to your layout for hook-up, possibly discarding cards that can't fit (that would cause an overlap).

2438,"LNL: Laplace, Newton & Lagrange",1994,5.2,6,0,2,2,90,90,Wargames,Print & Play Science Fiction Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemHex-and-Counter,"BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.

LNL - Laplace, Newton  Lagrange (briefly known as DeltaVee in its early stages) is a game of ship to ship combat in outer space.  Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.

The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.

The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.

Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.

Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.

2439,Queen Victoria's Navy,1996,6.875,8,2,1,2,90,90,Wargames,Nautical Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemHex-and-Counter,"Queen Victoria's Navy is a nautical combat war game for two players which simulates the period from 1880-1906.  The game scale is 500 meters per hex and about 5 minutes per turn.  Capital ships are modeled individually.  Complexity is medium.  Time to learn is from 30-45 minutes.

Players take the role of squadron commanders, the principal tactical leaders in the battle fleet.  As such, they are in charge of a manageable force of capital ships, generally 3-12.  Designed for 2 players, Queen Victoria's Navy is also suitable for solitaire or multiple players, each scenario taking about 1 hour to complete.

This game manages to blend three often contradictory goals together seamlessly: affordability, game-play, and authenticity.  The focus of the game is to recreate the conditions of a capital ship battle.  Torpedo boats, gunboats and sundry other smaller vessels have been left out of the game as they were not critical components of the Battle Fleet concept, and their inclusion would have added complexity and cost to the game.  However, thanks to the simplicity of the rules, it is an easy task to design these craft for your own games.

Bones is a two player strategy game in which each player tries to be the first to get 5 squares of his colour in a vertical or horizontal row.  It may seem similar to other games, but Bones has a unique aspect that makes game play very different from what you might expect!  Can you deal with the overlapping of pieces better than your opponent?

The game is played on a 9x12 grid, with pieces that measure 1x2; each player gets a set of 18 pieces, but more can be made if necessary.  The first tile must be played so it occupies part of the middle; later tiles can be played anywhere as long as they're entirely within the playing area and as long as it does not cover up an already played tile in one move (in other words, it's OK to cover a tile completely, but this must be done in two turns).

Tiles is an abstract card game for two or three players.  Players play tiles to try to close areas of their colour to score points.  The larger the closed area, the more points scored.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

There are 45 square tiles, each subdivided into four triangular areas which are either white, black or gray.  Each player is assigned a colour.  Tiles must be played so the edge colours match already-played tiles; if one cannot play any tile, one must discard instead.  You can score only on your own turn.

2445,Chaseback,1962,4.83333,6,1,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"This is an unusual two-player strategy game.  The board consists of five columns, within each of which a man moves back and forth.  The men are moved by both players.  At the ends of each column are the players' goals (one end belongs to one player, the other end to his opponent).  Each player tries to reach his goals by exact count, scoring a point every time this is achieved.  First player to reach 15 points wins.
   The spaces within the columns are numbered in seemingly random fashion, except for the centre row, which is all numbered 4.  The game starts with all men in the centre.  One player calls out a number from 1 to 5.  His opponent then moves a man that number of spaces in either direction (no back-and-forthing allowed).  The number on the space onto which the man lands gives the move for the next man --and this mechanism applies throughout the game, so the only random element is the initial call of 1 to 5.
   Each player moves three different men, then his opponent does the same (the first man he moves cannot be the last one you moved), and so on.  Every time a man reaches a goal (by exact count), a point is scored and the man teleports back to the centre.  To complicate matters slightly, there are two safe spaces in each column, those on one side of the centre belonging to one player, those on the other to his opponent.  A player may not move more than two men onto safe spaces at once.  You cannot move a man from your opponent's safe spaces, so this is used to constrain the opponent's possible moves.
   A software version of this would be very interesting, particularly if the board could be randomised...

You try to go out (empty your hand) during each hand; score is kept and the first player to reach 100 wins.
   Each player is dealt 6 cards.  You begin by placing two cards of your choice in front of you, face up, to create two discard piles.  The two cards played must match either by colour or by number.  In turn, you play one card from your hand onto any of the discard piles.  To play onto a pile, the card played must match the other pile's card in number or colour.  If you can't or don't wish to play a card, you must draw cards until you can play one.  Should the draw be exhausted, a new deck is made from the discard piles, keeping only the topmost cards.
   To go out, your discard piles must at least tie all the others in number value.  Score is 10 points for the player who went out, plus the combined values of the cards left in the other players' hands.  The discards aren't scored.
   Rainbow cards are wild, being of all four colours at once --they match any card.  The card value is zero, which may be handy to reduce an opponent's discard piles value.  X cards (also worth zero), on the other hand, can only be matched by Rainbow or X cards.

Slasher Flick:  Revenge of the Bogeyman in Exciting 2-D
This Butcher Does More Than Bring Home the Bacon!

Simulates the action in body-count movies such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, Silent Scream and others.  One player represents the Bogeyman, a superhuman maniacal mass murderer, and the other takes the part of the collection of victims he intends to murder. Movement of the 14 characters including a Bus Driver, Whiz Kid, Football Player, Surfer, BMOC, Biker, ROTC, Psych Major, Cheerleader, Jockette, Preppie, Valley Girl, Ingenue takes place on the map. The victims try to stay alive as long as possible. Each character has a unique set of attributes for movement, special abilities, disadvantages and damage.

Can be played as a board role-playing game (and thus expanded past just two players). One player takes the role of the Bogeyman; other players take the roles of only a few of the victims. This can lead to some animated conversation between the Victim players, sounding suspiciously like the real thing.

The entire deck of 62 cards is dealt out, minus two cards. The first and last player exchange two cards, the next-to-first and next-to-last exchange one.

Each player is dealt 7 of the 108 cards. On your turn, you either draw 1 or 2 cards, or pick up one or more cards from the playing area (more on this later). Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).

Going out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.

The number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!). However, if played as a Special to go out, it zaps someone else's (of your choosing) round score!

As warefare and technology have advanced, battles are fought over the limb of the horizon with no edges to the battlefield. This is the transformational premise of Global Chess. There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.

Think of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.

The easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form. The possible strategy is yet to be written! The board is annotated to record game play.

Introduction
This year the Massai celebrate the beginning of the rainy season with a big party. The best architects in the two neighboring villages show up at the dry river bed and will try to join the two towns together with a series of huts.. The first who manages to do so will become the architect of the year.

Each player receives 15 huts of his/her color, 4 yellow pawns used as guards in order to protect some of the huts. and 1 red pawn and 1 tactic sheet which contains the plan for the game seen from either side of the board.  Each player secretly sets up his huts on a tactic sheet. Once both players have done this the tactic sheets are exposed and then the huts are transferred from the tactic sheet to the board.

Each player has two possible moves on his turn. He may either build a new hut or he may attack an opponent's hut.

In order to win an architect must establish an uninterrupted chain of 6 huts between the 2 dry river beds or an architect can also win if his opponent has no huts on the game board.

This game is part of the Abacus wood box series.

In DH:A, the 10-sided die is used to generate the random results to determine the outcome of battles, spells, and incidents.  Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.

The battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.  Individual figures can be grouped together with a leader in combat, supporting their leader in its fight and dying together with it if its roll fails against an opponent.

The winning conditions for a battle can include total destruction of the enemy, seizing an objective, or fleeing the battlefield after being surrounded.

A turn consists of simultaneously selecting an action (at the start from four: colonise, build ship, build port, explore/prospect) Then in turn - Collect Income; Execute action; Take and execute an event card.  The length of an epoch is governed by the number of event cards, so the        more  players, the fewer actions you get.The victor is the player with the most money at the end of the last epoch.

Individual board squares may be colored to match one players color, or in a neutral color. The color of the landing site indicates which player (whether or not that is the active player) places one floor of a new building at this square.

The active player must then pay points to owners of all buildings over which the Helicopter has just flown. The pay rate is based on the total floor count for each color involved, and escalates steeply with increased floor count.

Turn ends with one additional floor of the appropriate color being added to each building flown over.

Some players may be eliminated early when unable to pay.  Game ends when one player cannot move (cannot reach an empty square), or when one player has no more floors to place.  Player with the most points wins.

But the emperor was tired and ready to retire. So one morning he summoned his children.  I am prepared to hand over the kingdom to one of you., he said. But first, you must pass a test --the same test I passed, and my father before me, and my grandmother before him.  You must go out into the land and find four Jewels of Justice and a crown which I have hidden.  You must uncover the Ruby of Love, Emerald of Faith, Sapphire of Wisdom, Amethyst of Truth and the Crown of Enlightenment.  The first of you who finds these precious objects and brings them to me will have demonstrated worthiness.  This is the one who will rule the kingdom.  Not wanting to be recognised by their enemies and delayed in their quest, the children disguised themselves as sage old men.  And, leaving the safety of the castle, they ventured out into the world --each with a guardian dragon, each hoping to be the one who returned with the four Jewels of justice and the fabulous Crown of Enlightenment.

The object of the game is to find a Crown of Enlightenment and one of each color of the four Jewels of Justice and return to home base with them.  The first player to do so inherits the kingdom and wins the game.

The rules include several variants.

Also included are rules for Emperor's Chess, which is considerably different, and two more two-player games (The Emperor's Secret and Sage  Dragon Sets).

A crosshair appears in the corner of each card, and distance is measured by the closest crosshair on the flicked card in relation to the closest crosshair on the target card. The number of cards to be scored is determined by the number on the closest card to the target (i.e. if a 4 card is closest to the target, the four closest cards all will score). Each card scores a number of points equal to the face value of the card multiplied by the number of crosshair symbols on the card that remain uncovered. If all four crosshairs on the target are covered, the player covering the last takes a penalty, as does any player causing the target card to fall off the table. Suggested game duration is as many rounds as the number of players; highest point total wins.

According to Zeethvah tradition, every warrior is eligible to rule. The rules of succession are simple.... one year from this date, the warrior that has aquired the most riches or has performed the most heroic deeds will become OUR NEW LEADER!

The goal of the Snarf Quest Card Game is to take our hero Snarf through a grand adventure and acquire as much treasure as possible. Each player is making his own adventure for Snarf. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure is declared to have the best Snarf adventure and becomes king of the Zeethvah village and WINS!

There are two basic departures from most card games. One, everyone draws from the same deck (known as the storydeck). Two, nobody ever holds cards in his hand. All cards are displayed where everyone can see them.

During each players turn, he controls Snarf (represented by the supplied miniature) and his actions. You must spend Action Points to move Snarf up and down the storyline (ten cards placed side by side next to the storydeck). As these storylines are activated, they are removed, the story line moves together and a replacement card is placed in the storyline next the the storydeck (the draw pile). Activated cards can help you or hurt your opponents, depending on what happens in the storyline. At the end of the game, the player with the most Treasure Points, Wins.

The basic game comes with 50 cards, a snarf miniature and is made for 2 to 3 players. However, with each additional 20 cards you add to your deck, one more player can be added. 5 is the recommended maximum. 20 card expansion sets can be purchased that also include a new miniature. Each of these expansions is based around a different character from the Snarf Quest comic strip. This is not a collectable card game, all starter and expansion decks are identical.

In 2003 the game was reproduced as a new version of the game which comes with a 100-card deck and one Snarf miniature. There are no expansions for this edition of the game.

2561,Pollyanna,1915,6.16667,15,1,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Racing ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Pollyanna is a race/pursuit game published by Parker Brothers between 1915 and 1967.  During those years, several editions appeared with differing artwork and game pieces.  Some of these editions are entitled Dixie or Dixie-Pollyanna and some are subtitled The Great Home Game, The Glad Game, or Parker Brothers Track Pursuit Game. In 1917 it was completely rethemed as The Popular Game of Broadway, with artwork of New York scenes featuring famous buildings of the time.  Pollyanna itself gets its name from the title of the 1913 children's novel by Eleanor H. Porter.  Each piece color in the game is associated with one of the characters in the novel.  In the original 1915 edition blue was Aunt Polly; green was Nancy; red was Jimmy; and yellow was John Pendleton.  These color associations changed in future editions.

The game is widely recognized as a variant of Parcheesi, which is itself derived from Pachisi, a classic game of India.  The object of Pollyanna, as in all games of the Pachisi family, is to be the first player to move his or her four men from the start space around the board to the home space.  During the course of the game, players may also land on single opposing pieces and send them back to start.  Two or three opposing pieces on the same space can neither be captured nor passed.

Pollyanna differs from Parcheesi in several important ways.


     The track is laid out as a square and is 62 spaces long between start and home (in Parcheesi it is laid out as a cross and is 72 spaces long); furthermore Pollyanna employs four turnoutsshort semi-circular paths off the main path (known as the broadway).  Only single pieces may occupy a turnout space, but pieces there may not be passed and are invulnerable to capture.  Turnouts are the most important difference between Pollyanna and Parcheesi.  They make the two games play quite differently.  



     The bonus move for capturing an opponent's piece is only 10 spaces, and there is no bonus for a piece reaching home (in Parcheesi these pay a 20-space and 10-space bonus respectively).  



     Doubles are handled differently. In Pollyanna each double earns the right to another roll, provided that the player was able to use both dice. (In Parcheesi, on the third consecutive roll of doubles a player loses his/her turn and must return one of his pieces to start.) In addition, only the obverse faces of dice are counted in doubles.  (In Parcheesi, both the obverse faces and reverse faces of the dice are counted.)



     Up to three pieces of the same color may occupy a space on the broadway.  This effectively means that a player can pass his or her own blockade, by first landing exactly on the blockade and joining it, and then moving on.  This is not possible in Parcheesi.



     Pieces are started on a roll of six (on either of the two dice or as the sum of the two dice).  In Parcheesi, the roll required is a five.  This means that starting a piece in Pollyanna is somewhat easier than in Parcheesi.   



     There are safe spaces for each color; there are no general safe spaces.  If a pawn is on a safe space of its own color no other player's pawn may land there, but it may pass through.

Certain combinations of monster sets may only be captured using specific monster-catching devices. As quickly as possible, players check their reference cards to determine which monster-catching device will work for the monster pair currently on display and place the appropriate card in the center of the table. The fastest players are rewarded while the slowest players or those selecting the wrong monster-catching apparatus are penalized.

Mutabohn allows different sorts of beans to be planted in the same field.  The box contains 33 Bonus cards and 4 pages of rules in German.  The cards contains 7 different pictures which have no influence on play, being flavour only.  There are 24 different combinations of bean types, in three Bonus values (30, 50 and 70).

The Bonus cards are shuffled and placed as a pile face down next to the draw pile.  Each player receives 2 Bonus cards (3 cards in a two-player game).  The Bonus cards are placed anywhere in the hand, they do not follow the strict order of the Bean cards.

In Mutabohn, genetic manipulations allow the beans to mutate while they are growing in the field.  Gartenbohnen may become Rote Bohnen.  Rote Bohnen may become Augenbohnen, etc.  Each bean type can be transformed into the next lower value (which has the next higher number of cards) simply by planting this new type of bean on top of the old beans.  Each Bonus card features a series of icons in the corners showing a pattern like AABBC (Small coloured pictures are used instead of letters) --this forms a gene-code which must match the pattern of beans in the field in order to play the bonus.

2595,Moon Dragon,1997,7,10,4,2,4,0,0,Wargames,Miniatures Science Fiction Wargame ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"In MoonDragon, players engage in tactical starship combat over the surface of the moon.  The spaceships are mounted on antennae and plastic joints, which combine to allow a remarkable range of positions -- for example, one could have a ship positioned upside down seven inches off the playing surface.  Movement is determined simultaneously and then resolved, often resulting in disaster for the inexperienced pilot.

Tactical space combat over the surface of the moon, using miniatures mounted on custom 3D telescoping flight stands. Each player is given two figures and stands for each of his ships, allowing him to see his old position while figuring his next movement (the extra ships are in play only during that ship's movement) - optional rules allow play with single figures. Each ship has a fighter display for tracking status. Weapons include a variety of lasers; the advanced rules add the paralyzer glue gun; resource rules also cover bombs, rockets, and missiles. Data is provided for four fighters plus non-combatants. The rulebook also provides Mission Builder random mission and campaign rules, a pilot development system, and a brief introduction to lunar terrain.

Boxed set includes:

80-page, 8.5 x 11 rules booklet
    Quick Start/Frequently Asked Questions sheet
    4 Ship Display sheets
    Assembly Instructions sheet (for the flight stands)
    Example Engagement pamphlet
    two template sheets
    blister pack containing 2x Wardog and 2 x Moondragon ship miniatures (manufactured by Rafm)
    ziploc bag containing 2 6-sided dice and 36 red and blue plastic disks (tokens)

        40 plastic 3D joints

Tactical. Scale unstated. Each figure represents an individual space fighter. Designed for use with the MoonDragon line of miniatures.

2618,Westwärts,1995,4.5,6,0,2,6,60,60,,American West Transportation ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"On his last long ride through the wide and wild West, the experienced expedition leader McTrucker realizes that he's getting too old for the job  but who will take his place? One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?

To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition  and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.

To set up Westwrts, twenty wagon cards  along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger  are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.

The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.

Gliders fly to a central island, pick up a fictional precious mineral and then fly home again.  Minerals are represented by actual small rocks.  Winds come from the four cardinal directions, apply the same for all players and are represented by six dice which hold the four colors.  Movement of a glider is handled as the additive result of these dice.  Players dial their movements simultaneously and one hopes without error. But one must beware of other gliders which if they land on one, send the glider immediately home without the mineral, much as in Backgammon.  Turbulence points in the four corners behave like warp points and permit gliders to teleport across the board.

2620,Schwimmer in der Wüste,1999,5.8,5,0,3,4,0,0,,Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Auction/BiddingTile Placement,"In English the title means Swimmers in the Desert which for some will give away the setting as that of the novel and film, THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.

The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.

The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called 2F or 3F marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the 2A or 1A markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.

When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.

A typical game usually last about 30 minutes.  Players take turns placing their fence pieces on the 8x8 grid.  The grid starts fenced in by neutral gray fence pieces.  The goal is to enclose a square so that you have more fence pieces surrounding it than any other player.  Once this occurs, you place your color stone on the square and then replace the surrounding fence pieces with neutral gray fences (this may now trigger scoring of adjacent squares).  The game ends when no more plays are available.  The winner is the player or team with the most stones on the board.

The basic grid size of the board is 8x8 squares.

2630,Die Bombe,1998,5.51429,21,1,3,6,20,20,,Card Game ,,"In each round, 2 cards are placed face up. Players then secretly bid on for those cards. The highest bidder can pick one of the two cards to keep. However, that player also receives minus points in the amount of his bid. The player with the second-highest bid gets the remaining card for nothing.

The cards
There are 6 bombs, 12 red and 12 green value cards. The value cards are worth from 3 ?25 in both colors. The values ascend by twos: 3, 5, 7, 9 ... 25.

Preparation
Each player receives a paper and a pen. Each player prepares a small table for the minuses on his paper. Leave enough space for bids beside the table.

The bombs and the value cards are first separated. The value cards are mixed, and 2 are put on the table face up, side by side. The remaining value cards are now shuffled well with the 6 bombs and the stack is placed face down in the middle of the table.

Play
Each player secretly makes a bid.  All players must bid at least 1. Bids can be no higher than 40. Now all players announce their bids.

1. The player with the highest number writes it in his deficit table. Now he can select one of the two face-up cards and keeps it in front of him.

2. The player with the second-highest number takes the remaining face-up card and keeps it in front of him. He does not write in his deficit table.

Now all players cross out their listed bids. The top two cards of the face-down stack are uncovered and the next round is played in exactly the same manner. Subsequent rounds are played in this way until the stack is completely spent. Then the final scores are announced.

Each player must display all cards won in plain view, with colors separated. Each individual number must be visible.

The bombs
When a player takes a bomb, it must be played immediately. The player gives the bomb to a player of his choice covering one of his red or green value cards! The player receiving the bomb must set it and the covered value card aside so that it will score nothing at the end of the game.

What happens if several players tie for the highest bid?
 Only the players who tied for the highest bid continue to bid on the card. Only 1 card is up for bid  and the remaining face-up card is put aside.

Final score
First the red cards are totaled, then the green in the same manner. Each player adds the values of his red cards. The player with the most red cards doubles the sum of his red cards; all others receive only their normal red-card points. If several players tie for the most red cards, all these players double their red points.

The points for the red and green cards are added. Minus points are subtracted. The total value of all cards won and minuses are announced at the end the game. The player with the highest score is the winner.

2644,Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,1987,4.19444,9,1,2,4,60,60,,Deduction Movies / TV / Radio theme Murder/Mystery ,Pick-up and DeliverRoll / Spin and Move,"Based on the movie, this game's object is to discover your opponents' identities, find the Will and return to your home space.

On your move, you roll two dice (black and white); you move as indicated by the white die (1-6), adding the black die (1-3) if you choose to.  Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).

Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.

You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each Dip rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the cancel dip die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.
