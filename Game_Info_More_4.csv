In I Drank What?, it is the party of the year, and all your worst enemies have been invited. You have brought along a bottle of poison to help spice the evening up. Funny, so did all the other guests. With all the witty banter and bumbling of the staff, you have lost track of which glasses of wine were poisoned.

The only thing certain is that someone is going to die, and the survivors will have a good laugh. It's all in good fun, so long as you have the last one. So propose a toast, and drink as if there were no tomorrow, because, for you, tomorrow may never come.

I Drank What? is the fast and furiously funny card game of poison toasts and split-second treachery. It's a wine tasting to die for...

Game Play
Each player has a card representing a glass of wine, face down in front of them; one of these glasses is poisoned. Eventually, everyone will have to take a drink, and someone will die. The last person left alive in the party wins.

The game is for 3 - 7 players and takes less than an hour to play.

Dubious Alliance is best described as a 'cooperative backstabber'. Players work together to survive the Orc realm of Hirntodia. To win, a Player must 'lie, cheat and steal' to negotiate favorable cards (magic, treasure, victory) and gain the highest Prestige value in trading cards by trading away negative cards (Traps, Monsters and more).

However, because you are a band, you can't out right kill your competition. If an Orc player dies, the game ends and everyone loses! So on the one hand, you are working together to survive and on the other, you need to keep your competition weak so you can win... truly a Dubious Alliance.

Each player starts with a hand of two cards from a deck of 104 and (optionally) ten Brawl cards, with the gnomes placed at the start of the track. On a turn, a player rolls the die, then moves along the track or into a business (exact roll not needed).

If on the trail, a player plays one card, then draws one card. Green cards give you items to sell later at businesses; purple cards provide an immediate action, such as additional movement, gem theft, missed turns, and so on; red cards allow you to attack another player or defend against attacks. If in a business, the player sells as many green cards as desired, collecting gems for the goods sold.

If being used, Brawl cards can be played when two gnomes land in the same space. If they agree to brawl, each player chooses one card from his personal deck, then simultaneously reveal them. The player with the higher card wins the difference between the cards in gems from the loser.

Players score extra gems or are penalized gems based on their order of finish, with any remaining green cards on the table selling for only half their value. The player with the most points wins.

The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an expert price can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.

This is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.

Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.

Title translates to The Spice Route.

While the core of Trivial Pursuit is still found in the 25th Anniversary Edition, there are a few differences from the original board game.  The original six categories are still used: geography, entertainment, history, art  literature, science  nature, sport  leisure.  Each category now has its own card, with six questions and three difficulty levels.  What you roll determines the level of difficulty of the question.  A roll of one or two results in an easy question, three or four a medium question, and five or six a hard question.  Play in the middle of the board is just like the 1981 version where you roll the die, move your scoring token that number of spaces, and try to answer a question in an attempt to roll again or, in a special case, win a wedge of the corresponding color.

The object of the game is still to win all 6 wedges and answer one final question in the center of the board.

The biggest difference of this new version is the addition of an outside track, which you move a 2nd playing piece, a pawn of the same color, around.  If you get a question correct, you get to move your pawn a certain number of spaces depending on the difficulty of the question answered.  If your pawn lands in one of the four specialty zones, you are granted a special power used either to help your chances to win the game or hurt your opponents.  These zones are the Face-Off Zone, the Slow it Down Zone, The Easy Cheesy Zone, and Freebie Zone.

Players can move by rolling the die and trying to pass through a country space to get a card.  Some paths have checkpoints which require a Passport to avoid losing a turn.  Ambush and Hostage cards are played against opponents to steal one of their cards, or make them lose a turn.

As soon as one collects the Ark, Staff, and Map cards at once (only 1, 2, and 3 of which are available), they move to a designated country to win.

122868,Blackrock City,2012,5.46648,91,1.9091,2,4,30,30,,American West ,Auction/Bidding,"In Blackrock City, you are the chief of your group of outlaws, and you want to claim as much gold and silver as possible by attacking cities and stagecoaches. You will have to be clever to estimate the number of outlaws needed to attack  and watch out for the Sheriff and your opponents!

The game is played in rounds. Each round, players bid on the right to perform the next bank robbery by placing a number of outlaws in the center of the playing area; each player starts with eight outlaws. Alternatively a player can skip the round or postpone an attack until after other players bid, but doing so will cause one or more of his outlaws to become wounded. When a player bids outlaws, the sheriff token moves a number of city tiles equal to the number of outlaws bid (in most cases). If a sheriff lands on a player's Chief of the Outlaws token  as these tokens are located on city tiles and not used for bidding  one of that player's outlaws is wounded.

The winner of the bid attacks a city, most likely netting him gold and possibly giving him new outlaws (as they are freed from that city's prison), but which city is attacked is determined by the difference between the winning bid and the lowest bid. Thus, bids from the other players will influence the winner's gains  and if the winner lands on the city tile where the sheriff is located, he gets nothing. The player with the second highest bid attacks the stagecoach and gains one silver.

If a player claims something from a city tile, it's flipped over and now has a different power for the remainder of the game, allowing a player who lands on the tile to steal gold or silver cubes from an opponent or wounding one of that player's outlaws. After each round, players collect the outlaws they used to bid and wound the healthy outlaws by flipping them over to their wounded side. A wounded outlaw who is wounded again is removed from the game. (Prisoners come into the game wounded, so they can be used only once.)

The game ends when no player has any outlaws remaining or all players refuse to bid in a given round. The player who has collected the most gold and silver wins!

The game plays in 4 rounds. Each round has 2 phases.

1- Each player receives as many habit cards as there are players around the table. E.g.: 4 cards for 4 players. You are always late, You cheat at games, You have the same Pink Floyd t-shirt since 1994.
Each player give to OTHER players the card of his hand that fits him best. Therefore, in a 4 player game, you give 3 cards (and receive 3). The last one is discarded.

2- In turns, each player reveals the cards he has received. All players (including the concerned one) secretly vote for the best matching habit. Players who voted for the most popular score one point. The chosen card is then kept by the player for the fourth round.
NOTE: The vote from the concerned player count as 1 vote only. He does not choose the habit alone, but he breaks ties.

On the fourth round, instead of distributing new habit cards, players skip the first phase and use the cards selected in the 3 first rounds. Each good vote is worth 2 points for this last round.

Player with the most point wins.

Players receive a random ice cream card at the start of the game and every round.  The ice cream card shows a carton of ice cream in one of six flavors.  It can supply an unlimited amount of that flavor during a round. During the round, players take turns drawing an ice cream scoop card, placing it on an existing ice cream cone or starting a new cone.  Once all the cones are made, players take turns serving cones, collecting the scoop cards from a cone that they can supply.  They must be able to supply the flavors for all the scoop cards in the cone, except possibly the flavor for a single scoop card, which they would discard.  If a player cannot serve a cone, they must draw another ice cream supply card instead.

At the end of a round, a player receives a point for each scoop card collected, as well as for excess ice cream supply cards.  All scoops and all ice cream cards used to supply scoops are shuffled back into the deck and a new round begins. Whoever has the most points after four rounds wins.

179956,The Arabian Pots,2014,5.39613,31,0,2,6,3,10,,Arabian Memory Puzzle ,Memory,"In medieval Baghdad, a boy named Afumed was working for a general shop. There were many pots containing many kinds of items. His boss gave orders to sort the pots, but Afumed lost the tags on them. Before the boss comes back, he must sort all the pots.

In The Arabian Pots, you try to sort the pots by listening to the sounds they make when you shake them. The game includes three groups of three pots, with each group making a different sound when you shake it, as well as one pot that makes no sound.

For the basic game, your goal is to create a row of three pots that make the same sound. To set up, set aside the quiet pot, then place the other nine pots at random in the 3x3 grid of the game board. While all other players look away from the board, the first player swaps pairs of pots three times, not shaking them in the process. All of the other players make three swaps in a similar manner, then the game begins. On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:


    Shake one of the pots.
    Swap two pots in the same horizontal or vertical line, without shaking them in the process.


If that player thinks a row contains pots that all have the same sound, yell Complete!, then shake the three pots to see whether the guess is correct. If so, the player wins; if not, that player loses their next turn and the game continues.

To use the quiet pot, during set up the first player replaces one of the regular pots with the quiet pot (without shaking anything), then does the pot swaps as usual. If someone shakes the quiet pot during the game, that player must then swap that pot with an adjacent pot while everyone else looks away from the board.

To play The Arabian Pots with people who are blind, announce which pots (1-9) you are shaking or moving. The notch in the game board indicates the bottom of the board.

As an alternate set-up, place the nine noisy pots on the board and the quiet pot to the side. Players then remove one pot at a time from the board, shaking them or not as desired, then place the pots in front of themselves. Place the quiet pot on #5, then take turns placing the pots on the board, leaving the final pot aside unshaken. Then play the game as normal except that whoever shakes the quiet pot must swap it with an adjacent pot (while others turn their back) and miss their next turn.

Draw at random one card from the deck of Game Word cards and put the letters of its Game Word in the blocks at the top of the score pad. The objective of the game is to earn each of the letters of the Game Word and be the first player to get back to the Starting Block.

Players earn letters of the Game Word by rolling the die, correctly answering a question drawn from the level of difficulty equal to the die's value (i.e., Levels I, II, III, IV, V, or VI), and moving along the alphabetized playing track. A correct answer allows the player to move to any space up to the value of the question. For example, a correct answer to a Level VI question allows the player to move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 spaces.

To earn a letter of the Game Word the player must land on its space.

WARNING! Opponents who land on your space have the right to move you to any other space on the playing track! The most devious of these will move you as far as possible from the letters you need.

To win the game, earn all the letters of the Game Word and be the first to get back to the Starting Block.

So they practice a lot and eat lots of fiery-hot dragonfruits. Today they are having a fire-breathing contest. The participant who manages to blow the floating fire ball into the right volcano field gets to collect the highly sought-after dragonfruits.

Dragi Drache is a dragon-themed action game for children. At the center of the board is a cardboard volcano that divides the board into six sections. Underneath the board (in the box) is an airblower that when switched on keeps a little ball afloat. Each player gets an individual game board and six dragonfruit chits in the same color. One dragonfruit chit per player color is then placed on each section of the game board.

To play the game, someone turns on the air blower, then places the ball on the air jet at the center of the board so that it floats over the volcano. The active player each turn tries to blow the ball into one of the board sections with a dragonfruit chit of her color, with only one chance to get the ball in the right spot. If the ball lands on a board section with a dragonfruit of her color, she takes that chit and places it on her game board. Whether she gets it or not, though, the next player then takes his turn.

The first player to collect six dragonfruits of her color wins!

The Baton Races of Yaz is played by two teams of Skadingles, Flibdills, Tarnoses and Luggants. The team that breaks all its bulges with its baton in the shortest time is the winner.

Each side has 2 batons, 5 Skadingles, 5 Flibdills, 5 Tarnoses, 8 Luggants and 10 Bulges

The game consists of a setting phase, when the bulges are placed on the map, and a movement phase.

Skadingles are fast but can only move through mud (clear).
Flibdills are slower but can move through mud and muck
Tarnoses are slower again and can travel through all 3 kinds of terrain.
Luggants are the slowest, can move through all 3 kinds of terrain, may not carry the baton, and can throttle opposing Yazzites.

The interesting mechanic is that the baton may be passed from one Yazzite to another with no movement penalty - allowing long moves.

// INTRODUCTION 

In 1930, the Pabodie Expedition left for the Antarctic Continent to carry out Geological prospecting operations. 
Part of the crew died and some of its members returned suffering from terrible psychological trauma due to the unfathomable primeval horrors they encountered.
In late 1934 all contact was lost with the Starkweather-Moore Expedition. It had followed in the footsteps of the first expedition, but all its team disappeared without leaving a trace.
In 1937 the millionaire philanthropist Alejo Crow begins investigating these strange occurrences.
On board the battleship Gigamesh, following the geographic indications hidden in the Necronomicon, the Crow-Yutani Expedition, comprising a select group of explorers and a commando of clone soldiers known as macutes, must face the sinister creatures that await them in the polar ice.
    
// OBJECT OF THE GAME 
A cooperative game in which players must try to survive the attack of primeval beings and kill all the monsters. Players lose if the attackers completely destroy the battleship Gigamesh or all the explorers of the resistance die.

They learned that these ancients simultaneously built pyramids towards the sky and had an extensive knowledge of the stars. It was rumored that perhaps they were the original colonizers and space-farers of the first human age.

Now, at the edge of a colossal black hole, a pyramid-craft known as the Zoneplex has emerged with legendary markings and glyphs of the deep past. The known empires have sent their elite warrior-monk mystics on a one-way mission to gain control of the Zoneplex, to emerge victorious and ultimately control the pathways of the universe and time itself.

Zoneplex is a game that combines a tile-laying/exploration mechanism, a collaborative battle system and a zone control system to create an intriguing adventure in an alien pyramid.

The game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.

In phase 1 players strategically lay tiles determined by action cards to build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid whilst being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins. While building strategically players also confront creatures within the pyramid which they must collect to become worthy to enter the Eye and win the game. The players control the Zoneplex by gaining Influence points which occurs when a Player places a spirit-stone on the board. Spirit Stones not only sustain one's Influence points but can also be removed to gain bonuses in combat.

In phase 2 after exploring the pyramid, the players reveal their Sacred Symbol cards and count influence points, then a cutthroat race for survival and worthiness begins as players vie to enter The Eye of The Zoneplex to become the decisive winner or stand their ground with the most influence points as the action cards run out.

Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks, and the goal is to end up with the most money when the game ends (which is either when only one network is left on the air, or when certain tiles run out).
Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events -- drawing an event card, auctioning off a new TV show or star or academy award movie, or triggering a ratings war.
During a ratings war, players lay out the tiles representing their prime-time line-up of shows and movies, along with bonuses for stars and reviews.  Shows with the lowest ratings in their time slot are cancelled, and when a network has no shows left, it goes off the air and the player is out of the game.

The bombs have various effects hidden on their base.  The tunnels are built through tile laying, so each player (best played with four) digs furiously from his manhole in the corner towards the bombs, hoping to reach 'em first.  If you connect tunnels, then you'll be able to try to steal another player's bomb before he brings it home.

The basic turn goes like this:

First, you move your pawn to another tunnel tile.
Second, if you ended up or started on a bomb, test (with a special die) to see if it blows up.
Third, draw a tunnel tile (you have a hand of four) and play one.
Finally, if you get a bomb home safely, read its message.

In addition to the tunnel tiles, there are white, black and grey spy tiles.  They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).

1909,Nomadi,1995,5.38043,46,0,2,5,60,60,,Dice Racing ,Roll / Spin and Move,"A game of moving camels across the desert. Each player has a number of camels and tries to get them across the desert first. However no-one survives in the desert alone - each camel must always be adjacent to at least one other camel.

The game board depicts a desert with a starting area in one corner and a finish area in the opposite corner. There are two oasis spaces in the middle of the desert and a gorge which approximately splits the desert in two.

After the initial placement of the pieces in the starting area, each player rolls all six of the dice, and moves whichever camels they want - restricted by the rule that a camel may never be by itself, but must have at least another camel in one of the 4 adjacent spaces (diagonal spaces do not count). The die roll determines how a camel may move: A 1 allows one space of diagonal or horizontal movement; a 2,3,or 4 allows the camel to move in a straight line (but not diagonally) that many spaces - it may also jump over any intervening camels; a 5 or 6 allows the camel to move that number of spaces and allows one right angle turn in the move - it may also jump over any intervening pieces.

Being the first person to move a camel onto an oasis earns the player bonus points, and also being the first person to move a camel past the gorge likewise earns a player bonus points. These bonus points are added to the points earned by your camel's finishing position (ie 8 points to the first camel to get to the finish line, 6 for the second camel and 4 for the third).

The person with the most points at the end of the game wins.

The aim of the game is to be the first pair to get all their pawns in their homes, just like Ludo and Pachisi. Instead of dice you play with playingcards.
The first round everyone gets 5 playing cards. The second and third rounds everyone gets 4 cards. At the end of the third round all the cards are shuffled and then the second three rounds begin, until one pair has won the game.

If you dont have a King or Ace in your hand, the very first round, you must put your 5 cards aside and take 5 new ones. Repeat this until you have at least one of those cards.

When its your turn you play a card in the middle and do what you have to do.
To set a pawn on the starting position (the colored point in the color of your pawns) you have to put down a King or Ace.
If you can play a card you have to do so, even if its bad for you or your partner.
If you cant play a card anymore you put down all your remaining cards in the middle. Your turns are over in this round.

If everyone has put down all of their cards, this round is over and another round can begin.

These are the actions:

Ace: put a pawn (yours or your partners) on your starting space or a pawn 1 place ahead.
King: put a pawn (yours or your partners) on your (or your partners) starting space.
Queen: move a pawn (yours or your partners) 12 spaces forward.
Jack: swap a pawn (yours or your partners) with one of the other players pawn.
Seven: move 1 or 2 pawns (yours or your partners) a total of seven spaces forward.
Four: a pawn has to move 4 spaces backwards.

When a pawn is standing on its own colored space, this pawn may not be beaten, nor swapped with a Jack, nor be overtaken.

With any other card you have to go forward spaces as shown on the card. During the whole game you can beat other pawns if you land on them. The beaten pawn has to go back to its place at the beginning of the game.

With 4 players you play with 1 deck of cards. With 6 players you play with 1.5 decks of cards.

Players choose one of four characters and travel on a random board made of individual tiles. They face monsters which re-spawn until monster generators are destroyed. Monster generation and combat are resolved by rolling dice.

From the back of the box...

Across time, four souls stumbled upon secrets not meant for mankind, and died... but not before going insane. In the 17th century, a Mariner Merchant visited port of Innsmouth filled with occultists worshipping Cthulhu and mating with Deep Ones. A late 19th century Arctic Explorer escaped the clutches of the Gnoph-Keh to find a hidden city of the Elder Things. At the turn of the 20th century, a Miskatonic Psychotherapist analyzing the dreams of his patients tapped into nightmares of Leng Spiders and Moon-Beasts. In the 1920's, a Private Eye investigating the disappearance of her farming parents revealed Star Vampires and Mi-Gos as the culprits. All four have been given a second chance at life but must relive and overcome their last and most terrifying days.

Cthulhu Mash is an easy to learn, fast paced, expandable, random tile, monster generating game that can be played in under an hour.  Not only can the game be played cooperatively, but rules are provided for death match, capture the flag, and solo games as well. Set in the Cthulhu Mythos.

In the game, players have a stack of chips. Each chip has 0 to 6 clout points. Players have to make a stack 15 chips, while not spending more than a set amount of Clout on the stack. Players take turns throwing the chips into the play area, and depending on how they hit the table, the individual effects of each chip occur. Chips have stats, abilities, and powers that affect game play. Some of the powers and abilities include protection, poison, weaken, and the strengthening of other chips within a radius of where the chip lands. After the chips land on the table, players can decide to attack other player's chips. Further chip effects can come into play in these situations. For example, chips with the Taunt ability force attacking chips to attack them before any other chips. Chips are eliminated from the play area as play continues. After throwing and playing out all their chips, players count all their Clout still in the play area plus extra points for proximity to other chips. Whoever has the most Clout points wins.

Some chips are common, while others are unique, adding to the collectability factor. In addition, there are various types of chips including effects, characters, and bases, to name just a few. Where chips land on the table and how players throw will have a significant effect on how the game will play out. The chips are approximately the same weight and style as casino poker chips, not cardboard. Physical skill will be a factor in game play, so gamers can start practicing their chip tossing now with the poker chips they already own.

This is the first set in the Clout series of games.

Everyone gets little poker chips, like in many gambling games, and a player rolls as much as he wishes during his turn, earning points equal to what he rolls. A player passes the dice when he wishes, but if he rolls one or two skunks, points rolled during that turn are ignored and penalties (in the form of discarding some of their poker chips) are enforced.  First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish.  The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10).  Number of max players seems to be only limited by the number of poker chips you use (each player starts with 50). This game is no longer manufactured, at least under the theme of Skunk.

Game consists of 6 rounds and a bonus round. In Round 1, the guesser sets the timer, the announcer draws a card and announces the category. The guesser must name 3 things in the given category like things at the beach for example. The timer is stopped as soon as the guesser is able to name 3 items that fit in the category. Their scoring peg is moved ahead based on where you stopped the timer (labeled 1-6). In Round 2, name 4 things and so on. For each round, the peg is moved ahead according to the number on the timer.

The final round is the lightning round. The guesser starts the timer and the announcer gives the category. The guesser must name 2 things for the given category. Once completed, the announcer sets the card aside, a new one is drawn, and the category is announced. Once again after 2 items have been named, the card is set aside and a new one is drawn. This continues until the timer stops. One point is given for each card completed. The scoring peg is moved accordingly.

The player with the most points is the winner.

2854,Exploration,1967,5.55849,99,1.4444,2,5,45,45,,Exploration ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Exploration was a very popular 1970s game from Britain's best game company, Waddingtons. The dramatic  colourful box cover, showing the Kon Tiki raft, mountain climbers, ziggurats, and scuba divers on a wreck, inspired thousands of British kids to explore the globe, at least in their fantasies. To win, you must mount an exploration to one of four Objectives (Lost City, Summit, Island and Sunken Galleon), return to base and make the most money. Being first back was not enough, you've got to make the best profit on your trip.
The game is played in 2 phases; initially you move round the outer track on die rolls, collecting Personnel cards, buying Equipment cards and drawing Exploration Club cards (which may gain or cost you cash to the Prize Fund). When your group is assembled, take the appropriate dobber (Yacht, Lorry, Tent or Ship) and set off.
The 2nd phase has you moving over land or sea using the unique Diradice, a d6 with a 5 symbols. These allow you to move 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally or diagonally. The problem is that the spaces on the board are littered with symbols which you can only cross if you have the correct equipment, like the compass, dinghy or mountain boots. You must have an explorer with the Main Objective to reach your goal, but the other personnel allow you to avoid hazards and reach Lesser Objectives (Skeleton, Pearls, Rare Flower etc.) to gain cash. 1st, 2nd and 3rd home get cash and 1st back gets the Prize Fund.
A pretty simple game of dice rolling, the only real choice is when to launch your trip. But the theme, the striking board and cards and that weird die makes this a fondly remembered game in the UK.

The game covers the period from 1 July to 4 July, 1863, when these two armies fought the bloodiest battle in American history to that point. The game system is an adaption fo the popular Napoleon at Waterloo system. Various special and optional rules allow the Players to recreate a picture of an historical event. (from the rules folder.}

Cemetery Hill is one of four games included in the Blue & Gray Quadrigame set. The game includes a 17 x 22 three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder. A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.

Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn. Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control. Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.

A new concept, Attack Effectiveness is introduced in this set of games. Essentially, attacking units that receive an Attacker Retreat result in combat are rendered ineffective (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day. This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs. This makes what the heck type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly ineffective through a series of low-odd attacks.

Planes represented are from the early war in the European theatre. The game's namesake, for example, appears in the Mark 1 and Mark V versions only.
It uses a simplified system for maneuver and combat that emphasizes game play over realism, and is very playable. Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.
A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.

Each round, players place their votes for the item types and spell categories they're most likely to be able to play. Three times during the game -- at the periodic Tribunals -- players are presented with 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-place awards for creating magic items with item types and spell categories that match those with the most votes.

Out on the ice, the hunter becomes the hunted!

The realm of the white bear lies in a distant region in the Arctic, near the north pole.  There lives the polar bear, or nanuq as he is known among the Inuit.  It is the strongest and most dangerous creature for far and wide, feared equally by man and animal.  Therefore, only with great care do the Inuit hunters dare to venture onto the ice, jumping from ice floe to ice floe towards their main source of food -- the fish.  Then they must evade the dangerous nanuq and return safely home with their catch!  Only the cleverest and most courageous Inuit will succeed in catching sufficient fish...

Each player has a team of four Inuit, who use ice floes to move to the opposite shore to catch fish, and then return home.  The game ends once a player succeeds in returning four Inuit to the home igloo, with each bringing along one fish.

This game has some surprising similarities to the American game Polar Dare! that was designed by Dan Glimne and published by Milton Bradley in that same year (1991).

21729,Snake Lake,2006,5.48163,98,1.5,3,6,30,30,,Card Game ,Action / Movement ProgrammingHand ManagementMemorySimultaneous Action Selection,"From the publisher: The game is about a group of snakes wandering in the woods trying to eat the apples that fall down from the trees (and avoiding eating the poisonous mushrooms). The snakes' frenzy bring them to run between the trees and players must me able to pilot them to the apples, avoiding mushrooms, trees and the other snakes. The game is card driven (the cards are describe the possible movements).

SnakeLake is a cross between the old computer game Snake and the board game Robo Rally, but is much simpler and faster than RR. You have a simple board with a grid and place some apple trees around, then each player chooses a starting point.

Each player uses cards to program their next three moves in secret on their own chart, with the 2nd and 3rd move sliding down each turn when the 1st card is used and a new card going in the 3rd slot. The cards simply show forward, left, right (twice each) and one stop card. They also tell you to draw an Event card, which add some randomness.

If your snake runs into a tree, or off the board when incomplete, or into another snake's body, you start over again somewhere else, reprogramming your next three snake moves. If you hit another snake's head, they go off and you score a point for each segment of their body. If you get your whole snake on the board and then get your head off the board, you score points for the length of your snake.

But the big points come from eating apples which fall from the apple trees. These have 8-12 points on them, and your snake runs over them to eat them and reveal the points scored. Likewise, there are some mushrooms which deduct points if eaten. The apples and mushrooms are placed when an Event card indicates. The other events include removing an apple, sending an opponent's snake to sleep (miss a turn), and make your snake's body longer or shorter.

Snake Lake is a light, fast, fun game and will suit children more than adult's. The best strategy seems to be eat an apple then get knocked off the board to start somewhere else, near more apples. Getting your whole snake on and off is hard work, and scores few points in comparison.

The components are nicely made, good shiny cards that should wear well. The rules need a little proof-reading but were clear enough. Snake Lake might be better for 3 or 4 players than 6 though, it got very crowded very quickly, even on the large side of the board.

While Warriors can move in any direction (like the Queen in Chess), Sabers may only move cardinally (as rooks) and Tridents may only move diagonally (as bishops).  Defenders, as the name implies, cannot capture but are used to block or confound one's opponent.  Pieces are captured in a Checkers-like fashion of being jumped over, with special rules for corner captures, and piece substitution.  An unusual game combining very well-known mechanics from two of the classics.

Three in a row wins you a box, but carry on, you must get three boxes in a row to win the game. Your opponent may even be a box ahead, but a little luck and clever strategy can still cheat him of ultimate victory.

The molded plastic gameboard consists of boxes arranged in a three-by-three grid. Each box has holes also in a three-by-three grid. Each box has been assigned a number from three to eleven, inclusive. The object for each player is to win any five boxes or three boxes in a row: orthogonally or diagonally.

One one's turn, the two six-sided dice are thrown. The player must place a peg in any hole that has a number which matches the total thrown on the dice. A throw of twelve gives the player the freedom to peg any hole. A throw of seven lets a player peg any box's center hole. A throw of two lets one remove an opponent's peg. A player wins a box by getting three in a row or any five holes.

As head priest of an Aztec warrior house, you must command a specialized team of Aztec warriors in ritual combat on the battlefield to satisfy the gods. Drawing on the power of teotl from your temple stone, your warriors can wield specialized nahualli animal attacks to strike or capture opposing warriors standing in your team's way of capturing your opponent's temple stone. The gods may show you favor by giving you an advantage during battle, but will it be you or your opponent that quenches their insatiable blood thirst today?

Players of Serpent Stones sit on opposite sides of a game board featuring seven staggered rows of Serpent Stones and take turns drawing a card and playing/discarding a card from an initial hand of five cards. Serpent Stones features three types of cards:


    Warrior cards, which are played on the Serpent Stones to build your Aztec warrior team
    Nahualli cards, which strike or capture opposing warrior cards
    Teotl cards, which are god cards that can give a player some tactical advantage during gameplay


A player wins when either he captures his opponent's temple stone by placing a warrior card on it or he forces his opponent to suffer the Wrath of Tezcatlipoca, a fancy Aztecian way of saying the opponent ran out of cards.

103828,The Jam,2011,5.42109,64,1.5,2,4,40,40,,Card Game Children's Game ,Hand Management,"Ahh, jam, a favorite treat from childhood! A bright sunny day  scarlet strawberries, sweet-scented raspberries, tasty apples, still warm pink scum, the humming of bees... Or a winter evening  cold outside, warm inside, a burning lamp, tea is ready  all that's left to choose is cherry or peach? Gooseberry or currant? Why not open a few jars and taste some of each. Of and it would be lovely to bake some pies with jam...

Now you can not only eat jam, you can play The Jam. In this game you need to make all sorts of jam and bake pies. At the start of the game each player has a hand of four cards and a task sheet; the sheet shows different combinations of jam and pies that you need to make to earn extra points at the end of the game. Players receive points by completing tasks, and also for each jam they make and each pie they bake. The one who has the most points at the end of the game wins.

All cards in the game can be used as either an Ingredient (the image at the bottom of the card) or a Recipe (jam, pies or fruit salad  the upper part of the card). At the beginning of the game the top eight cards are placed on the table face up, forming the Basket with Ingredients, fruits and berries.

How do we make jam? A player plays a jam Recipe from his hand, then places the necessary Ingredient on top of it, which he takes from the Basket (Raspberry jam from the hand + Raspberry from the Basket and so on). Fruit salad and pies are made a similar way, only to make a pie you need to use a completed jam Recipe (by yourself or one you received from trade) instead of taking it from the Basket.

The game is turn-based, and each player's turn has a few phases:


     Draw a card  take the top card from the deck.
     Trade  players can trade Recipes they made with other players.
     Play a card  you can make jam, bake pies, make a fruit salad; you can use one of the special rules; finally you can play a card as an Ingredient and place it in the Basket.
     Discard  you must discard Ingredients used to make a Recipe on your previous turn. 


The game has a few special cards with special features:


     The Bear goes to the player with the most baked pies and awards him 10 points  but eats one of the pies.
     Karlsman goes to the player who can offer him the most jam; he grants 7 points but eats the jam.
     Cone jam can be made using any Ingredient, and can then be used to make any pie.


The game ends once all the cards are used, including cards in the players' hands. Points are counted to see who the winner is. Different players complete the tasks on their task sheets differently: Some try to make Winter jam or bake Pies for granny, while others collect Favorite fruit. At the end of the game it becomes clear who made the correct choices that led to sweet victory!

Can your clique come out on top?

In Rise or Fall, you represent a clique and try to hold on to your popularity points for as long as you can. Each turn everyone plays a card simultaneously, either attacking one opponent's clique, defending your own, or trying your hand at self-promotion. (Brag much?)

In Night of the Grand Octopus, you are one of the Elect and have been recruited by the Illuminati to form a cult to glorify the tentacled one.

If only one cultist group occupies a location, that cult gains strength  but if two or more cults want the same spot, they must negotiate or both lose cult strength. If, on the other hand, a rival monster occupies the location, the cultist is eliminated. Gulp!

116596,Fruit Ninja Card Game,2011,5.40987,76,1,2,4,15,15,,Card Game Children's Game Video Game Theme ,Press Your Luck,"SUMMARY:
The Fruit Ninja Card Game is based on the popular Fruit Ninja video game popularized on the iOS and Andriod mobile platforms.  In the video game, fruit (and bombs) are tossed into the air and the player makes gestures to slice as much fruit with their sword as possible while avoiding bombs.
The Fruit Ninja Card Game is a very simple push your luck card game that makes thematic use of simply cutting the deck of cards.  By cutting the deck and selecting cards based on the risk associated with the color coded card backs, players attempt to be the first to either collect one of each of the 7 types of fruit or collect 25 pieces of the same type of fruit.

GAMEPLAY:
After shuffling the deck of cards, the starting player cuts the deck while making the sound of someone making a sword chop.  That player chooses either the top card from the bottom section of the deck or the bottom card from the top section of the deck (a choice between the two inner cards of the split deck). By looking at the color of the card backs, the player can asses the risk of choosing a particular card.  Some cards have a higher risk of being a bomb while having the potential to contain more pieces of fruit.  The player continues their turn as long as they avoid choosing a bomb card.  As long as the player only finds fruit cards, they continue adding up fruit and splitting the top section of the deck remaining from their previous split.  If the player chooses to stop, they get to keep their fruit cards and pass the deck to the next player.  If at some point the player chooses to cut the deck and chooses a bomb card, they end their turn and loose any fruit that they have revealed during that turn (while keeping fruit earned on previous turns).  Three types of power bananas can be played from a players saved stash of fruit to perform one of the following actions based on the type of fruit: steal a fruit, ignore a bomb or take an additional turn.  While very simple, this card game remains thematically true to the simple video game that it is based on.

CONTENTS:
103 Fruit Ninja Cards + 1 sheet of rules in English

FROM THE BOX:
Based on the hit game.  Make Sensei proud!  Cut the deck--select the top or the bottom.  The first player to collect one of each fruit or 25 of any fruit wins!  The colors on the card backs will help you choose.  Be wary! Bombs end your turn and you forfeit this turns bounty.  Power bananas grant special ninja powers.

(more or less Get lost, idiot) to a man who refused to shake his hand.

In Casse-toi Pov'con! you take on the role of either a right or left-wing politician (with names like Nicolas or Sgolne). There are certain types of people you like to meet, and others whom you would rather avoid. Ever present journalists can also be an irritating nuisance.

A stack of cards, representing a large crowd of people, is spread on the table. All players simultaneously race to find the types of cards that agree with their chosen politician. Some cards, however, cause your character stress. When you pass a certain threshold beyond which you cannot keep your cool (8 stress points), you stop searching through cards to yell Casse-toi pauvre con! and then the round ends. You track your popularity points on the score track. Whoever is the most popular at the end of the game will win the election!

They sing with all their heart, cuddle the artifacts, and rearrange them in ever new patterns.

But what if you do not know the religious rules? The best thing is to watch what the others are doing and imitate them. But cautious: Maybe your neighbor just violated a taboo and made the High Priestess angry 

Each player takes the role of the High Priestess once and determines the rules of her own religion. The other players are novices trying to sense these rules and thus gather as much karma as possible.

The priestess player secretly chooses four cards that determine which actions are rewarded and which taboo. The other players simply move a pawn on the board and are awarded points by the priestess based on how their actions (including seemingly irrelevant ones like body movement or tone of voice) correspond with the rules. At the end of a round the priestess receives the same score as the highest-scoring adept, encouraging her to make the rules difficult but not impossible to guess.

Set in the Olaf mansion, one player is Count Olaf, while the other player(s) are the Baudelaire children. The game lasts roughly 24 turns, which is how long it will take Mr. Poe to travel to the bank and back to the mansion to visit the children. While he's gone, it is Count Olaf's job to successfully play Tragedy cards to damage The Guardians health (by moving into a room in the manor on which The Guardian's marker is in then playing a special card), while the children attempt to collect items in the manor with which they can thwart Olaf's schemes and restore health to The Guardian. The children win if Poe manages to get back from the bank, but Olaf wins if he drains all of The Guardian's health and kills him. The theme is extremely well used in this high-presentation childrens game.

Excerpt from the box:
If you wish to play a game where the hero always wins, the villain is forever defeated, and innocent children are brought to warmth and safety, then I encourage you to put this box down immediately and for something involving lollipops, ponies, or educational flashcards. The lives of Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire are fraught with sorrow, mis-fortunate, and unpleasantness, and the game in their honor contains the exact same things.

Its market has become one of the most popular on the coast, and merchants are fighting to be able to install their stalls. Competition is tough to make a fortune, especially since the customer is demanding. This requires having well-stocked stalls to attract the wealthy customers and increase its reputation.

The value of the die shows the number of times that the action may be made. The goal is to obtain the highest reputation at the end of the day by setting up stalls on the market to sell goods at the best price that the player will have bought in port.

This one covers the whole European theater of WW2, and while being the one that simplifies the most the combat mechanics (counters have just the nationality symbol, no movement/combat factors), it delivers many of the choices that were taken during the conflict: the Axis has an initial superiority, though not enough to fight a blitzkrieg on all fronts, and has to choose between a conservative approach on the East to try and take the Western powers out of the game before the US enters the war, or attack the USSR earlier than 41 before it is ready to battle back, and prepare an Atlantic Wall... without neglecting the North African shores!

A simple game that allows you and your friends to reenact the European WW2 in less than 2h.

Delta Vee is a tactical simulation of combat among spaceships in the 24th Century. The game is intended for two players, although more may participate in scenarios devised by the players. Each hex on the Delta Vee game maps represents a volume 20,000 kilometers in diameter. The game uses a two-dimensional movement system; the plane of the playing area represents the ecliptic of the star system in which each battle occurs. Each Game-Turn represents 15 minutes.

During play, each player moves one or more spaceships about the game-map using a maneuver system that abstractly simulates the laws of Newtonian motion. Each spaceship is composed of a hull with a varying number of attached pods. Each pod represents a system that improves the ships capabilities in combat, movement, and/or some other aspect of spaceship operations.

Each player controls his spaceships by issuing Maneuver Commands (so that the ship may alter its velocity or direction of movement) and Battle Commands (so that weapons and other systems aboard the ship may be prepared for use). A spaceships combat abilities include laser fire, particle fire, four types of missiles, and battle craft (two man fighter craft launched from larger ships). The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play. During the game, energy expended, missiles launched, and damage incurred by the ship are recorded on the ships log.

Delta Vee is the tactical space combat system for SPIs science fiction role-playing game, Universe. Although there is little open warfare in the vast human interstellar empire of the 24th Century (contact with another space-faring race has yet to be established), there are many types of illegal ship traffic and disputes among self-governing worlds. These types of small conflicts form the background for the scenarios in Delta Vee.

The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides. Possibly Doris & Frank's first game and related to their Bunny Zick-Zack.

Fleet Admiral is a card game about becoming a fleet admiral.  Take your intrepid crew on missions, earn prestige, upgrade your ship.  Solve a galactic crisis.  And do it all faster than your opponents, because they want to be in charge too.
End of box

You are in command of a space vessel from one of the major powers of the Portable Galactic Empire (Human, Brerasan, Hragsh or Jasl-Riin). You want to become the fleet admiral.

You begin the game with a frigate from your race with a power/up grade cost of 1.  One level 1 crew member (orange shirt AKA (also known as) Operations, or a green shirt AKA Marine, or a blue shirt AKA Command) think Star Trek shirts with the colors changed.

You also draw one level 1 Component card.  there are four types (weapons, power, sensors and defence). Each of these card types has three specialty sub groups in their category.  When you add these cards to your ship you put them under your player board (ship), similar to Glory to Rome.

Game play:
There are two decks of cards (component and crew).  On your turn you go on a mission.  An 8 sided die is rolled. Four symbols on the die match the crew deck, 4 match the component deck, 1 thumbs up and 1 explosion. If you roll a symbol with one of the two deck symbols you draw one card from that deck.  On the upper portion of the card there will be one or two symbols.  If you don't have Crew or Components that match the symbol or symbols the mission is failed. If you can match the first card you must roll again and draw another card. Now you must be able to match up evenly with what is on the cards to what is on your ship.  Lets say the first card required a missile.  This is a subset of the weapon card.  So if you have a weapon card on your ship it must also be specific to the missile to pass phase one of this mission.  The second card drawn required an orange shirt.  Lets say you only have a green shirt assigned to the security section of your ship.  No worries. As captain you count as one crewman of any shirt color.  You have passed the second part of the mission. You could push your luck and roll the die again for a third part of the mission, but if you fail the requirement of the third card the entire mission fails.  So you stop at two.  You may now attach these cards to your ship if you wish. The first card was a crewman. You assign his orange shirt self to your medical station. The second card was Defenses, sub-set shields. You put it on your ship.  These cards now help you win future missions.

If you roll the thumbs up symbol you pick a card from either deck and auto pass that stage no matter what.  If it is the explosion the whole mission is failed, no matter what.  There are a few more rules in this area but that's the bulk.

As missions progress you can use cards earned from winning missions to upgrade your ship.  Bigger ship equals more crew that can be attached and more powerful weapons.  When you upgrade to a battleship a crisis starts to perk.  This is abstract.  At the beginning of a players turn (battleship or higher in possession) a crisis chit is placed in a pool on the table.  Once that pool grows to double the amount of players a crisis has begun.  If the pool grows beyond four times the players at the table everyone loses the game.  You knock the chits down on your turn by taking cards you have won during the mission and instead of adding them to your ship you discard them. Each won card discarded removes a chit.

There is some coop stuff possible on missions and if you beat the crisis you add up the point totals on your ship cards to determine the winner or fleet admiral.

A light game that could be used as a filler or just with beer and pretzels.

A little tongue in cheek ship captain card play fun that takes about half an hour.

Ho Chi Minh had requested cease fire negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and the French government was looking for a way out that would give them peace with honor. Both sides felt that a big win on the battlefield would finally secure at the peace table what they had been unable to obtain in six and a half years of war.

The site of this battle would be near a village called, in Vietnamese, Seat of the Border County Prefecture located in a distant valley of north western Vietnam near the Laotian border. The French high command, under General Henri Navarre, reasoned that such a remote location could not be successfully attacked. General Vo Nguyen Giap thought the position was nearly impossible to defend. The siege of Dien Bien Phu would be the result.

La valle de la mort (Death Valley) is a simulation of this epic siege that ended the French colonial presence in Asia and marked the beginning of a 21 year struggle for national unification. The game is designed for 2 players, one taking the role of the French commander of the fortress complex at Dien Bien Phu, the other of General Giap, commanding the Viet Minh forces laying siege. The game and scenarios are small enough to be played solitaire, however.

Each turn of the game represents one week. Each assault impulse represents one day. A point of combat strength represents 150 to 200 men, 6 aircraft, 5 or 6 guns, or a single tank. An inch on the map corresponds to 700 yards.

In the game world of Banditos, the Mexican people responded poorly to these changes, resulting in a decrease in effective security and an increase in creative accounting at the new Banco de Mexico. Once some of the alternatively principled people in the land of opportunity heard about this, they looked south of the border for their ventures.

You will play one of several American characters making runs into Mexico to pull bank heists. You will need to acquire vehicles, weapons, seed money, and maybe even some inside information to make it all happen.

The first player to get his character home with the equivalent of one million US dollars wins.

Players can acquire cards (vehicles etc.) by drawing them each turn, by buying them from other players, or by stealing them from the discard pile.

Doing anything deemed illegal, however, will bring heat to your character (if you steal from the discard pile or pull a heist,) or your vehicle (if you steal gas or pull a heist,) or Mexican cities (if you pull a heist.) 
It's up to you as a player to manage your risk and decide how desperate you are to acquire what you need versus how much heat you currently have.

If you have the guts to try a risky heist, it'll either pay off or you'll land in a Mexican jail and have to play catch-up.

Demoludy is a reimplementation of a Reiner Knizia game Gem Dealer. This game is also a sequel to the game Pan tu nie stał! (which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).

The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).

Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.

The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.

The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.

Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences
- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.
- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.
- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.
- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.
- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie stał! (Great Wall of China): Bazar Rżyckiego (which would be translated to: Rżycki's Bazaar)

You must hitchhike your way there using planes, trains and automobiles and the occasional bike from the thrift shop. Hey it was 99 cents! 
On this journey through the continent, youll hop into cars equipped with NOZ, turbos, and furry dice. Youll encounter some crazy drivers who might occasionally be drunk and take risky jumps just for the hell of it. Youll wish for awesome upgrades to your lift, but the others are wishing just the opposite.

On your turn, theyll be praying evil things upon you. Whatever they can think of to hinder your speed. Theyll throw old ladies and moose if they have to. Theyll send birds in your engine or just simply wish for you to crash and burn. But dont worry, their turn will come and vengeance will be sweet.

Youll have to strategically manage your limited hand size and choose which deck to draw from. Will you draw transportation cards to hopefully get the best ride in the game? Or will you draw some karma cards to boost your current ride and slow the others down.
While on this awesome road trip, youll have to choose your path, or let the driver take you further on his own path. The GPS will determine this. Youll have to stop at train crossings and travel through snowy hills, sandy deserts, big cities and farmland.

The race also has two levels of play. You can play the regular way, which is with the special ability text of the cards, or the Junior way. In the junior level, simply play without the text and use only the numbers. This will help young players learn simple math, strategy, and have fun while doing so.

But just when you thought the race was over, theres more to come expansions with new maps, more vehicles, more upgrades and of coursemore mayhem are already in the works. Why do you think we put STAGE 1 on the box?
So pack light, head out there, and hope for the best!

208,Ex & Hopp,1996,5.39667,60,1.2,2,6,30,30,,Card Game ,,"A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.

On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.

When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.

The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.

This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.

25988,Asalto,1803,5.37879,33,2.25,2,2,20,20,Abstract Wargames,Abstract Strategy Religious Wargame ,Grid MovementPoint to Point Movement,"This game evolved from (or alongside) Fox & Geese and seems to have appeared first in Germany at least as early as 1803, where it has been known as Belagerungsspiel (Siege Game) or Festungsspiel (Fortress Game.)  In English speaking countries it was published as Siege, or German Tactics.  Since it is played on essentially a Fox  Geese board with additional markings and pieces, it was often included in a set with rules for Fox  Geese and Solitaire.  The markings outline one nine-point side of the cross as a distinct fortress or castle, typically in a different color from the rest of the board's points.  Also, the horizontal lines of the board are in a different color than the rest, but for the few closest to the fortress.  This is to indicate where the attacker may not move; in some editions these markings are absent and instead simply described by the player's rules of movement.

The defending player has two pieces in the fortress, either on specific starting points or anywhere the player chooses, depending on the included rules.  The other player has twenty-four pieces, one on each of the board's remaining points.  The goal for the attacking player is to occupy all nine of the fortress points with one of his pieces.  The goal for the defending player is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces, thereby preventing occupation of the fortress.

Attackers may move along the vertical or diagonal lines towards the fortress only, except on the few marked horizontal lines near the fortress.  They may not jump or capture any pieces.  The defenders may move in any direction along any line, and may capture (remove from the board) an attacker's piece by jumping over it to a vacant opposite point.

Siege evolved further into a larger edition with a sixty-seven point board, seventeen points for the fortress (and three defending pieces) and fifty points for the attackers.  Sometimes published in Germany and continental Europe as Neues Belagerungsspiel (New Siege Game) or Grosses Festungs-Spiel (Big Fortress Game,) it was known in English-speaking countries as The Royal Garrison Game and has been published under many other names since then.

Dead Money is the newest game in the Friedey's series (Give Me the Brain, Lord of the Fries, and The Great Brain Robbery). It's a wacky cross between poker and Give Me The Brain.

Players begin with a hand of cards and no Brains. The Brains are cards in the deck; there are eight of them all together. The object of the game is to get rid of your cards, which represent (among other things) the money you have left in this poker game. Of course, a lot of the cards make you draw more cards, and a lot of them require that you have a Brain.

Dead Money is a quick-playing and clever variation on a classic Cheapass game, and it features glorious cowboy zombies by artist Brian Snoddy.

Trade goods on the space lanes, work for crime lords, or engage in your own piracy - the big bucks are for those who can smuggle past orbital customs stations.

Use your credits to upgrade your space freighter and find other special equipment. Freedom of movement and diversity of choice don't keep Smugglers of the Galaxy from being a simple and easy play.

Some of the many options for players include: Space Trading, Smuggling, Piracy, Bounty Hunting, and Starship Upgrades.

SPACE TRADING
Every planet has different demands for Food, Robots, Weapons, Luxuries, and Medical Supplies.  Buy low on one world and sell high on another. Expand your ships cargo capacity and upgrade your Lightspeed to make credits quick - but watch out for pirates on the space lanes.

SMUGGLING
Some goods are illegal on some worlds - but that means big bucks to those who can smuggle them past customs! Larger worlds generally have larger starports - which means better security but also better profits. Crime Bosses offer the biggest payoffs but youll regret it if you fail them. Find friends and technology that will help you smuggle because you dont want to get caught with a shipload of illegal goods.

PIRACY
Become a space pirate yourself by arming your ship and blasting unsuspecting merchant ships (and other players) for their cargo. Be careful though - as your bounty stacks up, tougher bounty hunters will become interested in you.

BOUNTY HUNTING
So other players have bounties on their heads? Go after them and collect! But making powerful enemies in the galaxy may be your undoing. A good bounty hunter must know when and where to strike.

UPGRADE YOUR SPACESHIP
Whether peaceful merchant, shifty smuggler, or ruthless warrior - everyone could use a better ship. Upgrade your Lasers, Engines, Lightspeed, Shields, and Cargo Pods and keep your enemies off your back and increase your money-making potential. In addition to these standard upgrades, be on the lookout for unusual technology, such as cloaking devices, secret compartments, telepathic orbs, and more.

The board is a plastic table with 6x6 depressions, but the 4 corners are blocked so there are only 32 playing spaces. One player seeds the board with 11 grey discs.

Then each player fills a plastic tube with wooden discs, one with blue, the other with yellow discs. One player starts in the corner and moves the tube. If it goes over an empty space, the disc falls and occupies the place. The other player can choose to then take this tube, or start with the other, so removing the starting advantage. The players then continue to move their tubes around, until one gets 11 discs down for the win. The tubes can be moved orthogonally or diagonally any distance, but not jump or turn corners.

Reportedly a good abstract game and a clever physical mechanism.

The structure of Kit  Caboodle draws on the complexities of probability, set theory, the riddle of evolution, and the psychology of perception.

Actually, it is a dice game very similar in gameplay to Yahtzee or Kismet. Players have six dice, and roll any or all dice one, two or three times attempting to obtain dice combinations fitting a scoring category. Players fill scoring boxes and add them for a total score. The player with the highest total score wins the game.

Instead of number combinations, though, you are mixing and matching animals and their characteristics (plus a moon and and planet!). For each turn you must fill in a category on the scorepad. So there are decisions such as whether to use a bird for a Bird Caboodle, a Wings Kit, or a Shells Kit.

Not all seventeen figures are on all the dice, as they are six-sided, so you must keep in mind that some rolls would not work, ever. Also figures aren't represented equally but are merely an assortment. For example, there are 4 birds, all green; there are 2 boo but only one of all the other purple letters, 3 moons, 2 green planets, and 2 pterosaurs (one of each color).

The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are pie spaces, and from these there are spokes of track leading to the middle of the board.

Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.

Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.

3434,Golden Deuce,2002,5.542,80,1.7143,2,4,90,90,,Card Game ,Hand Management,"This game is based on the ancient Chinese game of Choi Dai Di (Known as 'Big Two' in English, similar to Pusoy Dos in the Philippines).  This special deck, however, has 60 cards, instead of the standard 52, which changes (for the better) the odds of the game and increases the strategy involved.  Another difference from the classic game, is that the publishers have added a game board for keeping score, adding even more strategy, because players have choices on how to move their pawns.

The game starts with a round of the Golden Deuce card game - lay down higher tricks than the other players for control of the lead. Be the first player to lay down all the cards in your hand, and you gain points for all the cards left in the other players' hands.

Moving to the game board, each player strategically moves any of their pawns the number of spaces to match the points earned in the card game round. Players can choose to move all of their pawns around the board at once (and therefore be able to block out opponents) or move one at a time (and capitalize on the amount of spaces moved).

Once all players have moved, another card game round starts, and the game ends when one player has moved all of their pawns to the finish.

146146,Galapagos,2013,5.39946,74,1.5,2,4,30,30,,Dice ,Dice RollingPoint to Point Movement,"In Galapagos, players move around the island searching for new species of turtles and trying to stay one step ahead of everyone else. With good planning and some luck on the dice, you'll collect more turtles than anyone else and triumph on this whirlwind island tour.

During set-up, players arrange the island tiles, then place five or six turtles on various tiles, depending on the number of players. Each player places his character token on the island and takes five color dice.

In each round, all players simultaneously roll their dice, then arrange them in the order they want to use them. Whoever first completes his planning grabs the sand timer in the center of the board, starting the timer for everyone else to finish their plans. Once time runs out, this player moves his character on the island, moving it to an adjacent space matching the color of the first die in his plan, then moving it again, and so on  ideally picking up lots of turtles along the way. The other players take turns in clockwise order. A player who lands his character on a corner space can move to either adjacent corner space (as long as he's placed the correct color in his movement chart).

Players add turtles to the board to bring the total available to five or six, then start a new round. Once all the turtles have been collected, the game ends and the player score for the turtles they've collected: 8 points for a set of six differently-colored turtles, and 1 point for each other turtle. Whoever has the highest score wins!

The game has been designed with the fun strategy player in mind. Playing time 40 - 180+ mins depending on the number of players.

The game Cat Attack is based on the trials and tribulations of the domestic cat. The board represents a local neighborhood. Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square. Some of these cards are good news but you know what happened to the curious cat!

13513,Skåål,2004,5.45075,134,1.875,3,6,60,60,,Exploration Fantasy Humor ,,"From the publisher, Tilsit Editions:

In the country of Skaaland, each player heads up a clan of dwarves with only one idea in its collective head: to become Skaal, the royal clan the most respected among all of the dwarves. But getting the respect of the dwarves, who are small but proud, is not a simple matter. You need to be a good gold prospector but also an honoured beer brewer!

After a preliminary placement phase during which the pieces are set up on the game board representing Skaaland (with its regions and villages), each player tries to win respect points.

Each turn, each player may only carry out one of the six available actions. Players can bring new dwarves into the game, move those already on the board, prospect in search of gold, mine discovered gold, open a tavern or move a tavern.

The problem with dwarves is that they're sometimes a little impetuous. For example, if a player discovers gold in a region, a rumour of its discovery immediately propagates across the land and the dwarves from the neighbouring regions arrive at top speed to see the new discovery. Not a moment's peace!

Sometimes, while prospecting, a player runs into oops instead. That's annoying because the effort was wasted, and it means that there will never be any gold in that region.

But gold isn't the only thing that matters in life! Digging is thirsty work and if a clan has a majority in a region, it may open a tavern. If the dwarves are too drunk to dig, then the clan that owns the tavern gains, each turn, respect points equal to the number of dwarves from opposing clans around the tavern. And that's good!

The drunk dwarves either flee this village of debauchery, or return with their buddies and take over the den of iniquity.

Contents: 1 rules insert, 1 game board, 90 dwarf figures, 12 tavern markers, 1 sack of 'gold', 1 sack of 'oops', 1 prospecting pawn, 1 special die.

This game is the 3rd in the Tilsit Collection series.

You move your characters around the board from city to city, and you ultimately win the game by taking over cities. You as a gang boss get Notoriety Points by having your characters fight and hurt other players' characters. If you miss in a fight, you do Collateral Damage to the city (thus the name of the game).

With the confusion surrounding the surrender of Italy, seizing those islands struck Churchill as easy pickings, with a vast potential for future Allied operations. A single British brigade, the 234th, began a bold island hopping campaign. In time, the Germans countered and checked the advance, first at the island of Kos, and then later at Leros. The war in the Aegean highlighted a clash of weapons systems, with the Luftwaffe controlling the air while the Royal Navy dominated the seas.

Each Game Turn represents one week. Each Impulse of a Game Turn can represent a variable amount of time within that week. A hex is approximately six and one half kilometers across. Ground units range in size from companies to regiments. Naval units represent a single vessel, although Torpedo Boats and MFP counters represent 2-3 vessels each.

The four-game series included Mighty Warriors, Ultra Marines, Kerrunch, and Space Fleet. The game includes dice, floor tiles, door stand-ups, 36 highly detailed Citadel Miniatures, and reference cards for army lists and spells.

In Mighty Warriors, players choose from either a band of Heroes or Skaven Ratmen. The Heroes are led by a Noble Knight, a Fearless Dwarf, and a Heroic Elf while the Skaven Ratmen are led by a Chaos Wizard and four Skaven Champions. The Elf and Chaos Wizard can cast spells. The other characters have differing combat abilities.

Players set up the castle from modular floor tiles, which are then connected by stand-up doors. The players then position their forces throughout the rooms of the castle. Finally a shield for each side is placed.

The game is played in phases including Magic, Movement, Missile Combat, Melee Combat, and Recovery from Stuns. Each player attacks the other while moving from one room of the castle to another. A player wins by capturing the opponents shield.

This game is basically a light version of HeroQuest or Warhammer Quest, more of a skirmish style than exploration, Dungeon Crawl. The instructions state that the game is compatible with Ultra Marines so that players can have a fantasy versus science fiction battle.

A slight error in calculation and an errant asteroid put an end to that idyll. A deadly collision occurred...

All hands on deck! The central computer has turned on the emergency power supply and displayed a list of repair instructions. Time to act!

Manage your astronaut team, and bring all the damaged systems back into operation. Use your wit to move crates and tools. Delegate people for spacesuit duties in the cosmic void. Use robots for assistance. Do the tasks you've been assigned, or undermine the work of others! Will you succeed in planning your actions efficiently in tight claustrophobic spaces with zero gravity?

Set in outer space, Astro Jam is a fascinating game of logic for 2-4 people. The emotions that the game releases must go hand in hand with the best of your analytical thinking skills.

In Astro Jam players operate on a modular game board by playing action cards from their hands and arranging them in sequences. Using the cards, the players move their or the opponents astronaut tokens, use the assistance of common robots, transport crates in narrow space of the orbital station, and send themselves or other astronauts on spacesuit duty. The central computer orders tasks for the players to deliver the objects located at the station into one of three active sites crucial for the operation of the facility. In this way, the players earn points that may ensure the victory. The first player who scores 5 points wins the game.

Frederic Vester designed kolopoly in 1980 and it was first published as a supplement in the journal Nature. At the Munich International Horticultural Exposition 1983 it was first offered as a board game designed by Vester information pavilion of the Bavarian Ministry of the Environment. In 1984  Ravensburger launched kolopoly for the general market. While the magazine version had used marker stones on the tables, the final version used adjustable dials. Later a computer version was developed and published under the title ecopolicy. (Source: Wikipedia, http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96kolopoly)

OVERVIEW

An attempt to turn an ecological/economic/sociological computer simulation into a board game. Since 1993, players can choose between two scenarios: Kybernetien is an industrial nation, Kyborien a developing country.

One or more players adjust 9 wheels each turn, representing current conditions. Settings influence each other as well. E.g. high production increases waste, which in turn decreases standard of living, which in turn decreases action points (political acceptance) for the next round.

Goal is to guarantee stable conditions, but often the game ends in disaster. Optionally, the game can be played with event cards (good and bad).

In the middle of a lake deep in a jungle, a centuries-old Idol sits atop an ancient tower. Its a race to see who will be the first player to build a path across the lake and up the tower, seize the priceless Idol and escape to a waiting boat. But dangers lurk on every turn -- your opponent might block your escape route or steal the Idol from you -- or even bury your Explorer under a stone block!

The Strategy Game of Capture and Escape 
Using a team of Explorers and an array of action cards, place blocks across the lake to create a 3D path to the top of the tower. With each roll of the die, your Explorers get closer to the Idol. If you draw the right card, you can leap ahead of the other players, steal an opponents card or send a player back to the start. But the game can change in a heartbeat - your Explorers might be stranded on the shore or buried beneath a block -- so every move requires strategy and planning.

The first player to reach the top of the tower, capture the Idol and escape to a waiting boat wins.

Idol QuestTM is fast-paced fun for the entire family!

You start out in life with $200, a Credit Card and a Business in the Working Class (outer ring of the board) and your objective is to get into the Middle Class and eventually High Society (inner ring). You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.

With six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to Other Purchases. Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.

You can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.

To enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again. The risk with marriage is that you may end up on a Divorce square...

From a Waddington ad dated 1976:  A macho game of Social Climbing - Do you have what it takes to be a success? Start with $200 in the working class. Then try to make it to the Middle Class and High Society. You'll have to face all of life's anxiety's along the way, but there is always the chance of making it rich! Get in the Ratrace! You'll bite and claw your way to the top. You'll never know when you might need the skills this game will teach you  -  in real life!

The action cards are used for tactical advantages. Movement of the players is die driven. There are slightly different rules if you are a defending team than if you are an attacking team, because the attacking team is currently in possession of the ball, the defending team's objective is to 'steal' the ball and become the attacking team now.

A start set of tiles are laid such that no color touches itself on an adjacent tile.  Through the game, tiles are added to the board by the players with this same restriction.

On your turn, you add a marker to claim one of the colored spots on the board; up to two markers can be placed on a space.  When you have four adjacent markers that are all on different colors, you can place a tower. Once the tower is placed, this spot is no longer usable for any other marker connections. The game ends when no more towers can be placed or when someone manages to place all 10 of their towers.  The player with the most placed towers wins.

Tile placement and marker placement are both critical, as is where to place your tower so that you don't shut off further growth options.  It is possible to end up with a bunch of uselessly placed markers once all four colors will not be available to any of them.  The game nicely comes with English and German rules.

Following an ancient plan, the grail shall be brought to its designated place. But do the other initiates have the same goal as you? Whom can you trust?

Assassins, Templars, Rosicrucians and Illuminates start the hunt for the grail. The pawns on the gameboard belong to nobody, each player may move each of them. Throughout the game, however, each player may try to gain control over the pawns by secretly exerting influence on them. The winner of the game is not the one who brings home the grail, but the one who controls the bearer of the grail; in other words: The one who proves to have the highest influence...

Clockwise, the players move one of the pawns on the gameboard, or invest hidden influence points. Displeasing moves by other players may be rejected if you reveal to have a higher influence on that pawn than the player who made the move. Furthermore, displeasing pawns can be removed from the game by uncovering them. But in order to do so, you have to control the pawn which blows the other pawn's cover, and the amount of influence you can spend during the game is limited.

The game is named after the ancient Greek mathematician, famous for describing the principle of the lever.

The game consists of: a wooden board affixed to a rounded base, forming a teeter-totter assembly; 14 white marbles and 14 black marbles; and a specially numbered die.  The length of the board is engraved with a grid of spaces in which to fit the marbles, 16 rows of 3 spaces each. The goal of the game is for the winning player to move at least 4 of his marbles to one end of the board without either end of the board touching the table at any time.

The game begins with no marbles on the board, and the board balanced level.  Each player receives 14 marbles of one color, and chooses one end of the board as his goal.  On the player's move, the player may choose to either place a marble in one of the two central rows of the board, or to roll the die. The die will indicate a number from one to three.  The player may then move any of his marbles already on the board the number of spaces indicated by the die roll.  The player may move a single marble, or split the move between two or more marbles.  Marbles may be moved in any direction except diagonally.  The player may jump the opposing player pieces, but not his own. If at any time during the move either end of the board touches the table, the player loses and the game ends.  Otherwise, the first player to place four of his marbles in his goal spaces (last two rows on the end of the board) wins the game.  The rules also contain several variants of the basic game.

Not as easy as it sounds.  You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comess when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.

Players must continue increasing the bid clockwise around the table until someone decides to call the bidder.  Then, all dice are revealed, and 2 additional community dice are rolled, mirroring the river and the turn.  If the bidder can make his bid, the caller must pay him the number of chips equal to the difference between his bid and the actual count, otherwise the bidder pays the caller.  If the bidder made his bid exactly, he wins the pot.  In any case, the loser of that challenge also loses one of their dice.  A player is out of the game if he runs out of chips or dice.

934,Die Kette von Saba,1984,5.38194,72,1.5,3,7,60,60,,Economic ,Auction/BiddingTile Placement,"extrapolated from session report:

The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.

The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.

The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.

Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  
Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.

The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:


     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. 



     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. 



     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. 


Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.

The game ends once the necklace is completed. The player with the most money is victorious.

They have convinced Bilbo to embark on a most unexpected journey  but first Gandalf, along with the Dwarves Dwalin, Kili and Fili, must find the other ten Dwarves who are lost in the Hobbit holes of Hobbiton.

In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the players first build the game out of LEGO bricks, then they take turns rolling a special six-sided die. If a player rolls 1-3, he moves his figure the number of spaces rolled and uses a torch to lift a piece out of the Hobbit hole on which he landed. Hopefully the bottom of the piece shows a Dwarf. If so, the player keeps the Dwarf and play passes to the left. If a player finds a Hobbit instead, he lifts a piece out of any other Hobbit hole on the board in an attempt to locate another Hobbit; if the player finds a match, he keeps the pair of Hobbits and is rewarded with the opportunity to peek at the bottom of a piece from any other Hobbit hole.

Instead of a Hobbit or Dwarf, some pieces feature a picture of breakfast. Matching two breakfasts allows a player to take a Dwarf piece already obtained by an opponent and return it to the Hobbit hole of his choice. The last possibility when revealing a piece is to find a picture of a rune. Matching two runes allows a player to select another Hobbit hole of his choice; if he finds a Dwarf in this location, he keeps it and play passes to the left. The custom die also features a picture of a map on one side. Rolling the map allows a player to move to any Hobbit hole on the board.

After all ten Dwarves have been found, the player with the most Dwarves wins. The game comes with variant rules, including one that shifts the location of Hobbit holes by swinging portions of the board into different configurations. Another variant requires players to find Thorin, the leader of the Dwarves, last. Another places Bilbo in one of the Hobbit holes.

On a turn, a player rolls the two dice, then catches a mouse of the color showing on the dice, assuming the player hasn't already collected that color this turn. If you roll the same color on both dice, you steal a mouse from your opponent! You may keep rolling but if you can't catch a mouse after a die roll, you lose everything. The game ends when there are no mice left, and points are scored for captured mice.

Polar Derby features the same game play as Catch the Mice but instead of mice players collect bears on roller skates, which is completely ridiculous and unbelievable. Bears on pogo sticks, sure, but not roller skates...

When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.

20018,Aloha,2005,5.46107,131,2.2,2,5,45,45,,Territory Building ,Press Your LuckTile Placement,"From the publisher:
Aloha, Holiday Island. Island tourism grew explosively around 1960 and travel agents searched desperately for new paradise beaches. Your travel office asks you to explore new holiday destinations. Your task is to find the best beaches and the most attractive locations.

Aloha is a nice mix of tile play and push-your-luck. Players are travel reps trying to secure the best beaches by placing sun loungers on beaches as they explore the island. The tiles show a good mix of land and water, with 1-3 golden beaches on most tiles. On your turn, you jump your rep to a new place, then draw a tile. This must be placed adjacent so you can walk straight onto it, otherwise your turn is over. If you walk on, and it has a beach, you have the option of dropping a lounger in your color onto it on its side.

Then you can decide to push your luck and draw another tile. Each time you walk on, you may drop another lounger, but these go onto their sides. When you decide you've done enough or cannot move on anyway, you stop drawing and turn your loungers upright. But if you draw a tile you can't place so that you walk on, you lose all the loungers on their sides back to your pot. The tile still gets placed, and the game has a clever rule. Whenever a tile is placed, it must go where it touches the most tiles. So if the tile is going next to where you stand, sometimes you have no choice, the game forces its placement. But usually you have a few choices and these are crucial to pushing your luck.

Finally, when all the tiles are down, the island is scored. The longest beach gets a 10pt marker, the next a 9pt marker and so on (with rules for tie-breaks). Then, the player with the most loungers on that beach collects to points markers (more tie-breaks). Also, any loungers still in your pot are also worth 1 pt each.

At first, you think you must fight over owning beaches, and try to wrest back control of a beach. But in fact you will only win by occupying several beaches, and often you only need 3 or 4 markers to secure control. Being able to start a beach, get control, then extend it to get most points will win. Players can be unlucky and draw un-walkable tiles a few times, but this means you are not picking the correct places when jumping.

As the game ends, your options reduce, but you should have done your work already. The result is a nice looking island, with lush jungle and bluewater inlets, dotted with lots of loungers.

You have nothing to do till your turn, but if you make the right choices, you should have a winning chance. Knowing when to go one more tile matters, and knowing when to stop. Players with lots of loungers left in front of them can still win, but may have wasted their opportunities.

Each player has 12 metal pawns (which feel great to hold and move!) and the object is to move these pawns into the back two rows on the opposite side of the board. The first player to accomplish this is victorious.

Movement is very basic. A pawn can only move by leaping over other pawns, ala Chinese Checkers. However, a pawn may leap over any number of pawns that are in a row, either vertically or horizontally. Players alternate making moves until someone wins.

The dice are numbered 1 to 5 (that is, each die has one of the five numbers), and the three you pick have to be played in order.  If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a Sponsor of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.

The game is played in 2 phases. During phase 1, all the cards of one deck are sold by auctions of 1-4 cards each.

Phase 2 is played with the second deck. Before starting, the winning cards are drawn from deck 2 and the paid jetons from phase 1 are put on these cards.

The remaining cards are revealed card after card and the players having these cards must discard them. The more cards are revealed, the more the chance of having one of the winning cards increases. Players are allowed to trade among each other anytime during phase 2. Such trades are more likely towards the end of the game.

Winner is the player with the most jetons.

The three six-sided dice show the numbers 1 to 3, twice each per die. A half-hearted attempt has been made to theme the game around two cannibal tribes trying to eat each other.

The columns on the board are numbered 3 to 9. Down the center of the board (column 6) runs a stream. The board is initially empty. Each player in turn rolls the three dice and then places one of their cannibals anywhere on the column given by the total of the three dice. If a player rolls three of a kind, they place a pawn and then take another turn. If a player rolls 1,2,3 then they do not place a pawn. If you enclose a line of the opponent's pawns between two of your pawns (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the opponent must take back their pawns except for those in column 6.  The enclosure may wrap around the top and bottom of the board, but not the sides.

The first player to place their final pawn on the board wins.

You can get as many goods as you want, but you can't take more than Aunt Trudel will allow you to take and she's a bit of a weirdo when it comes to making sales. If your goods weigh more than the goods that Aunt Trudel has set aside, then you get nothing!

In Tante Trudels Trdel, players shop from a 5x5 array of goods, each with their own basket. One item  a coat hanger, a vase, a dollhouse couch  is placed on most of the spaces in the array, while a few spaces are covered with vouchers. Three items are set aside at random, and those are the goods that Aunt Trudel will weigh at checkout to see whether you'd met her tough standards.

All players start on the same corner of the game board with a shopping basket. On a turn, a player rolls a die, moves her basket that many spaces around the game board in a clockwise direction, then picks up one item (or voucher) from the row that her basket is next to and places it in her basket. If a player's basket lands on the same location as an opponent's basket, then the player can take an item from the opponent instead. If a player picks up a voucher, she can exchange it later for another item on the board, putting the voucher in its place, in addition to taking an item. The first player to circle the board has the option of then moving counter-clockwise to pick up more goods; everyone else is finished once they circle the game board.

Each player in turn then weighs her goods against Aunt Trudel's holdings using the funky cardboard scale included in the box. If your goods weight more than Trudel's, you're out; if not, then you're still in the game. Of those players, whoever has the heaviest goods wins!

Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.

The player pawns move along a spiral on the outer part of the board. The player in turn launches his little hopper which flies and lands like a parachute. The space it lands on, in an arithmetic combination with the number on the space of your pawn, decides how far you can move. 
If your hopper lands on one of the 8 action fields, you have to perform special flying maneuvers.

First player that reaches the last space of the spiral with his pawn wins the game.

A number of monster tiles are spread face down on the table. The aim of the game is to collect as many families of three identical monsters as possible, without being fooled by similar-looking impostors!

When the game starts, each player (using one hand only) must turn over and pick up as many monster tiles as possible, one by one. Each tile thus collected is placed face down in the player's other hand. Once a player has placed a tile in their second hand, they cannot look at it again or put it back on the table. Any mistakes will cost you dearly, with penalty points at the end of the game for incomplete and mismatched families.

A limited number of trophy tiles are laid out face up alongside the monster tiles. Bonus points are awarded for each trophy tile at the end of the game. At any time, a player can pick up the highest-value trophy tile still available and place it in their other hand. The player must then stop playing. When the last trophy tile is taken, all the players who have collected a trophy tile and stopped playing start calling out a ten-second countdown.

More missions mean more points - as long as they're complete! If they're left incomplete by the end of the game, they score negative points and pretty much ensure you're not going to win...

Four separate decks are needed to play the game. The Mission Deck cards state what combinations are needed in order to complete a mission. The more specific the requirements the more points the completed mission is worth - some can be very difficult to finish but will prove very lucrative, but there's always the risk they'll count against you.

The other decks represent three different cities - London, Paris and Berlin - and contain the Agents, Tools, Intelligence and Locations you'll need. Intervention cards can be used as instants and will allow you to turn the game in your favour (as long as you play them at the correct time. Should that all important card you require be lost in the discard piles, you may be able to retrieve it, but that'll come at a high cost.

All the cards are placed face down in the center of the table. In each turn the players must always take at least one card from the top of this draw pile.

If a player picks up a 'castle' card, she places it in front of her, marking the beginning of a castle in the color of that particular card. If another player is already building a castle in that color, the player must place the card face up on her right-hand side. These cards can be discarded or sold later in the game. After having picked up a castle card, the player may take yet another card from the pile, or pass her turn.

If a player picks up a 'fairy' or a 'diamond' card, it also has to be placed face up on the player's right-hand side. As with a castle card another card may be taken from the pile after having picked up a fairy card, or the turn may be passed.

Diamond cards can be used to buy castle cards from other players. 3 diamond cards can be exchanged for a single castle card. A player may not refuse to sell a castle card. Furthermore, only a single castle card can be bought in a turn. A player is not allowed to take a card from the pile in the same turn in which she buys a castle card from an opponent.

If a player picks up a 'witch' card it's bad luck! Then a player must place the witch card, and 3 other cards next to the pile of cards in the center of the table and pass her turn. The 3 other cards can be diamond cards or castle cards, either from the player's right-hand side pile or from her own castle. If a player has less then 3 cards, she must hand in whatever cards she has.
A fairy card can be used to counter the witch card. If countered, both the witch card and the fairy card must be placed on the pile next to the cards in the center of the table.

Whenever there are no more cards left in the pile, all the cards that are next to the pile are taken, shuffled and placed back in the center of the table to form a new draw pile.

The player who manages to build her own castle completely (6 cards of the same color) wins the game.

It is a modern version of the game of Poch.  Each hand has three phases: Hearts, Poker, and Michigan Rummy.  All cards are dealt out, including one extra hand which remains unseen.  Players place chips in the spaces for the special combinations on the playing mat/board, the Poker pot, and the Kitty.  The first phase pays off for holding certain cards or combinations (that match the combinations on the playing layout/board).  The second phase is a hand of poker; each player selecting five cards from his hand to play.  A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the Poker pot, and the winner wins the Poker pot.  In the third phase, players play a slight variation of the game of Michigan (similar to Fan Tan), and the first to go out wins the chips in the Kitty.

The book Games We Play pictures a version of Poch published in ~1830 in Nuremberg by Verlag Fr Scharrer.  From this illustration we can see the evolution of Pope Joan to Poch, which was further refined into the Tripoley we see today.

This game is a Public Domain game known as Michigan Rummy.  This name comes from the third phase where the standard deck playing card game of Michigan (Stops Family) is played.  Michigan Rummy should not be confused with the game of 500 Rum and its variation called Michigan Rum from the Rummy Family.

The spots on the board are 10-J-Q-K-A of Hearts (5 spots), 8-9-10 all one suit (one spot), Q-K of Hearts (one spot), and the Kitty.

The White Elephant Card Game simulates this classic holiday game in a quick, light family card game.

In the White Elephant Card Game you play the part of a no-good cheapskate, unwilling to spend a measly dime on the people on your gift list. However, you will be attending several White Elephant parties. You can take some junk from your attic and exchange it for treasures to give as gifts. If you play your cards right you could fill your gift list for free and no one will be the wiser!

Each player has a Gift List Card, a list of three people for whom to acquire gifts. The Gift Cards in their hand constitute their attic. There is one White Elephant Party for each card in a players attic.

For each party a player brings a gift to the party by placing one Gift Card from their hand facedown on the table in front of them. The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and opens it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or steal an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.

This continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played. At the end of the game each player counts only the one highest-numbered Gift Card they received that matches each color on their gift list. The total of these cards is the players final score. The player with the most points wins.

Goal of the game is to find the 3 bones in the colour of your own puppy dog first. The bones lay spread upside down at random in a circle.

In the year 3085, four teenage heroes-for-hire and their pals warp through the universe to save adorable aliens and their worlds. When evil gets all fancy, they break that biz down...for hope!

In the Bravest Warriors Co-operative Dice Game, you take on the role of one of the Bravest Warriors or one of their best pals. Working together, you'll try to overcome Events and Encounters seen in Bravest Warriors episodes using your Portals and Special Abilities. Encounters require various symbols to beat them, and those symbols are found on the twelve custom dice, which are divided up between the players as evenly as possible. Each player rolls her own dice, but once rolled the dice are pooled together to use them as best you can as a team. If you don't roll what you need, you can play Portal cards (as seen in the Sugarbellies episode of the show) or use your character's Special Abilities. Conversion Portals, Re-Roll Portals, Gift Portals and more can make the difference between success and failure.

When you fail a challenge, the team suffers a calamity and the Encounter is placed into the Failed! pile. If you fail five Encounters, you lose the game! If you run out of Portal cards, you lose the game! If too many Bravest Warriors get K.O.ed, you lose the game! But if you score enough Victory Points or use up all of the Event cards, your team wins! (The actual number of VPs needed to win depends on whether you're playing easy mode (for younger or new players) or standard mode.)

9969,Speculation,2003,5.40882,51,2.3333,3,5,60,60,,Economic ,Auction/BiddingHand ManagementPress Your LuckRoll / Spin and MoveSet CollectionStock Holding,"Speculation is a game about having as much worth as possible when the game ends. And unlike some Monopoly-like games, this one definitely ends when one of the draw piles are empty.

You start the game with 150,000 and that's all the money you get from the bank. No beauty contests to win here, so you'd better spend them wisely. You will get cards with collectible items, though. And a the item value increases the more items you have in the collection. So getting lots of cards in one collection is good, but naturally there is a risk - each collection can possibly be fake and worth nothing. This is controlled by the Insider Information cards which sometimes are available for auction in the game.

Another interesting aspect of the game is the trading part. If you put cards down on the table, they are always for sale, and if an opponent happens to land on Trade, he can buy a category from you (for the market value). However, you can never lose money on showing your cards, but your opponent may increase his collection and therefore earn more - unless they are fake, of course.

The final balancing aspect is that the cards that you don't show are not declared properly, so if you land on Tax Razzia, you have to pay for those cards.

There are also bank-controlled auctions.

Speculation is a very well balanced, exciting and different economic game and you don't know for sure who's the winner until it's all over.

The game is in Swedish and scales well from three to five players. It works well for six players as well, but then you have to add a player marker and some money.

The battlefield, divided by hills and streams, became known as Austerlitz and would be celebrated as Napoleons greatest victory.

After fierce fighting amid the morning mists, the sun broke through the clouds. The French stormed the key Pratzen Heights, and after a bloody bayonet fight with the Russian troops manning the lines forced the Allied army into a disorganized retreat.

The 34x22 map features not hexagons but irregular-sized areas which relate to the actual topography of the area being depicted.  198 counters in two sizes (2/3 square and 1 and 1/3x2/3 long pieces) depict the infantry, cavalry, artillery units and the leaders so necessary in this activation system; the better leaders activate their troops more readily and more often.

This is a new rules set , bearing some resemblance to the earlier Napoleonic games by Avalanche Press, but also borrowing from their War of the States and Rome At War series.

A promising looking idea (and set of components) is Spin  Trap. 19 balls are arranged in a hex pattern. Each player has 8 balls in their color, and 3 green ones are added as well. The first player to get 2 of them is the winner. However, both players can move any ball they want. To do this, there are two tools available: they are plastic pieces that are placed over the balls on the board. The smaller of the two grabs 3 balls (in a triangle), while the larger one has seven openings  one in the middle and six around the edges. The middle opening must be placed over a ball of your own color. Once positioned, the tools can be rotated, moving all of the balls around. If a player manages to arrange it such that a green ball is surrounded by nothing but his own color, then he can take that green ball from the board. Its replaced with one of your own color, which means you have a slight advantage. The first player to get 2 green balls is the winner.

 The Volcano Has Spoken  Roll a black and you'll be subject to the whims of the volatile FURT volcano, which is sometimes angry, sort of bossy and always a bit weird.

To set up the game, shuffle the 45 target cards, then lay them out face up in stacks of 15 in the three card trays. On a turn, a player can roll the dice up to three times, setting aside any dice that she wants to keep after each of the first two rolls. If a player could claim a target card after the first or second roll  such as a card showing three-of-a-kind  but decides to roll again, she can no longer claim that card after a future roll. Once a player claims a card, her turn ends and the next player goes, rolling all six dice to start the turn.

If a player doesn't claim a card, however, the next player has the option of immediately claiming a card that matches the dice previously set aside or keeping those dice set aside and having only two rolls on his turn to try to claim a card.

Some cards have icons that allow whoever wins it to take a special action, such as a bonus turn or theft of a card from an opponent.

After a player has claimed a certain number of cards (4, 5 or 7 with four-to-six, three or two players), that player can decide to end the game. The game ends automatically once a player has claimed six, eight or ten cards (again, based on the number of players). Players then tally their points, and whoever has the high score wins!

The Ice token freezes a pawn in place and doesn't allow you to move it until the ice token is moved to another player's pawn.

The Fire token lets you move much more quickly around the board.

Other differences from original Sorry!:

1) A player can move a pawn out of the Start space with any number card except 4 (in the original game, only 1, 2, and Sorry cards could be used to leave the Start space). Players also only have 3 pawns instead of 4 like in the original Sorry!

3) The 2 card no longer entitles the player to draw another card (instead they get to place the Fire token).

4) The Sorry card can be used to advance 4 spaces when no pawn can be bumped (either player drawing Sorry has no pawns in Home, or there are no opponent pawns on the main track).

The game is unique in that there is no point system. The game is simply won by the first player to find and recover the artifact.

Players take turns rolling the dice, moving Scouts throughout the island, collecting jewels and other resources, and unlocking and trading clues.

The game's signature feature is its suspense inducing mechanism for trading clues: before any trade takes place, the two players involved must secretly decide whether to honor or dishonor the trade. Dishonoring a trade gives a player the chance to steal the clue from the other player without giving up his or her own clue, but is risky and can have serious consequences. Throughout the game, players balance the risks of earning clues on their own (which takes time), trading clues with other players (which means giving up hard earned secrets), or dishonoring trades and stealing the clues (and making enemies).

The game ends in a flurry of last minute deals and trades as Players try to outwit each other and unlock that one last clue...

HISTORY

Marauders was released in 2012 by Tolman Games. The 1st Edition is a prototype ready version and has a limited print run of 1,000 copies. Tolman Games released this 1st Edition through a Kickstarter campaign in September. The 2nd Edition will be updated based on feedback from Players of the 1st Edition, and is scheduled to be released as a larger print run in 2013.

Marauders can be played by 2 players, but 3 to 4 players are recommended.

On his turn, the player rolls a special die and uses it to move his equipment pieces toward an enemy HQ. The barriers can be breached by moving a ladder or wire-cutter onto them, or alternatively the passport piece can be moved onto the central checkpoint square to allow other pieces to pass through here. Each type of equipment has a point value (gun = 6, dagger =5, etc). When two opposing pieces occupy the same square, the one with the lower value is removed (both are removed if they are of equal value). Players cannot continue missions with fewer than five pieces of equipment and are forced to return to the outer board to acquire replacements before continuing. If a player manages to land a piece onto an opposing diplomatic bag, it is captured and he can start to move both pieces back towards his own HQ as a single unit.

While moving on both the inner and outer board, the player may have to draw a chance card of some sort, and this is where the game's chief gimmick comes into play and from where it takes its name. These cards all have the word 'Microdot' on them, written in dots. One of these dots contains a very small number or letter and the included plastic magnifying glass is supposed to be used to read it (but this is not really necessary). The letter/number is then referenced on the relevant 'decode' chart and the instructions followed.

This imaginative, play-packed game is sure to be a hit with clever little pirates.

In this game, players have to remove treasures from a wobbly hammock using a tool. Each turn, a player spins the spinner, and moves his pawn according to the number spun. The space that he lands on puts a restriction on his next attempt to get a treasure by either specifying the color of the treasure, the kind of treasure or the tool to use.

The game ends when all the treasures have been removed from the hammock; the player with the most treasures wins. The game also ends when Captain Hook (which is also in the hammock, next to the treasures) falls from the hammock. In that case, the player who caused him to fall cannot win - the player other than him with the most treasures wins the game.

In Ramses Return, Knizia and other designers, um, return to the setting of the first game, with players now trying to capture three different golden treasures to win the game. During the game set-up, six differently-colored crystals are hidden underneath six temples placed on the board. An additional eight crystals are laid out on the game board, with four types of golden treasures on display as well, one type in each corner. On a turn, the player rolls the die and gets one of two results:

 If the die shows one or two colors and the player has a crystal matching one of these colors, then she can move up to two spaces on the board. If she lacks a matching crystal, she picks up a temple and secretly looks inside: if the crystal inside the temple matches, she reveals it, moves her figure up to two spaces, then sets the temple down again, possibly in a new location; if the crystal doesn't match, she replaces the temple and doesn't move.

 If the die shows a mummy, the player moves her token up to three spaces and moves the mummy three spaces around the outer edge of the board. Any player caught by the mummy leaves a golden treasure (or a crystal if no treasure is held) in that space, then returns to start. The mummy and token movement can be done in either order.

Land on a crystal or golden treasure that you don't have, and you can claim it. Collecting crystals helps you move more consistently, and collecting treasures is how you win the game. The rules include a few variants for mummy movement and crystal power.

13333,Dead Hand Chaos Poker,2004,5.20025,40,1.8,2,10,5,5,,Card Game ,Betting/Wagering,"The Dead Hand Chaos Poker deck adds a twist on traditional poker. Play virtually any poker game you can think of (7-card stud, 5-card draw, etc). At the end of a hand, if there are still two or more players left for the showdown, the top card from the draw pile is turned face-up. 60% of the cards have a hidden message on the face of the card. By tipping the card back and forth in the light, a particular card or hand will be revealed in the varnish of the card. The named card or hand (if any) is dead and out of play.

For instance, if the King of Spades is flipped up, the hand with the low spade is dead. If a seven is flipped, all Wild cards are dead.

Even with its unique twist, Dead Hand is primarily a straight-forward game of Poker. The Dead Hand mechanic ends up only effecting approximately 20% of the hands played. So don't use the mechanic as a crutch, you've still got to play good poker.

That said, you may find that the added element of chance keeps people in the game longer and folding a bit less than they might otherwise. A reference card is included, so you can watch which cards have been played and have a better idea of which hands are more likely to be killed by the Dead Hand.

You can bail at any time, and score as many birthday cake pieces as the number of fish that came off the dance floor.

In an attempt to escape, 007 steals one of the villain Kanangas boats. Can you complete the escape? Find out in this thrilling boat chase through the Louisiana bayou with Kanangas men in hot pursuit. This game was designed for two players aged eight and up.

Extremely rare collector's item, to my knowledge only published in England due to copyright problems. This simple game (Ages 8 and up) is part of the then successful James Bond franchise of Victory Games. It was an attempt to create a simple 2-player game which would also appeal to kids (in contrast to their more complex efforts like the faulted James Bond Assault Game). It is basically the race from the movie Live and let Die - James Bond uses a motorboat to escape the evil henchmen of Kananga. Simple Action-System with small stand-up-boats and an abstract and slightly boring (small) board. Not a total waste of time - it actually works as a fast 2-player game.

76540,Formula 1: Officially Licensed Board Game,2010,5.31786,42,1,2,8,30,30,,Racing Sports ,Simulation,"You are an official F1 driver: choose your team among Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes and all the others and start with the qualifications! Decide your strategy, 1 or 2 pit stops or no one? Upon this, your tyres management is vital. Once the red lights turn off, insert the 1st gear and gradually speed up...you will feel like really driving! Pay attention to the curves: if you are driving too fast you could take the longer path or even go out of the track! But if you are good, you will enter the following straight at the best speed! Overtakes, accidents, tires wear, booster, engine damages and rain will add a touch of enchantment to all races.

Formula 1 IS A GAME FOR FAMILIES but SINCE no cards or dice move your car IS ALSO an interesting and appealing GAME FOR GAMERS.

HOW TO PLAY: cars are not moved by any die but according to the gear in that turn. The gear level is a pawn that can be moved on the own cars' card of one unit any turn, so the drivers can accelerate or slow down engaging a higher or lower gear every turn. 
The curves must be faced according to an optimal speed value shown on a sign. If the cars enter the curve with speed higher of 1 or 2 gears than the optimal one they will be forced to drive the entire curve on the outer lane or in the worst case to go out of the track and restart in the 1st gear.
The cars' movement can be powered by playing the tyres cards: at the beginning of the race any driver receives 6 tyres cards (35% of value 1, 48% of value 2 and 17% of value 3). These cards increase the cars' speed (not the gear) and playing them means to have a tyres' wear: the drivers can decide for 0, 1 or 2 pit stops during the 3 laps of the race, depending how they are spending the tyres cards. Actually in the pit stop the drivers will receive other 6 new tyres cards.
The booster can give a +2 movement by rolling two 6-sided dice but with the risk of damaging the highest gear compromising the race. Slipstreaming, engagement and weather conditions (with rain and slick tyres) complete a real simulative and easy to learn game.

Each turn a reader will read the actual definition to a word as found in a children's dictionary (so they're simple).  The first player/team to correctly blurt out the word that fits the definition gets to move their pawn forward the number of spaces rolled on the die.  There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly, so things tend to get a bit raucous!

The player to the reader's left becomes the new reader and a new round begins.  If a pawn land on certain spaces or the same space as an opponent, a one-on-one contest is held just between those two players with the victor getting to stay on the spot and the loser having to move back to where the trailing player started.

Each booster has the rules. 
You only need to buy two boosters to play with.

From a marketing standpoint this game should have sold well.  You do not have to purchase boxes of cards to play.  You buy a character pack and a story pack then find someone else who has done the same and play.

In the character pack you will get a character who stands up and all the cards you need to make him unique.  Each character has stats for might, resolve, savvy and combat.  You can add 5 points to spend upgrading your character.  You upgrade with 5 types of cards called merits with varying costs.  Abilities generally boost one of your 4 attributes.  Advantages are special skills available to the character. Allies are friends that travel with you and add their skills to help you.  Arts are magic abilities that help you in various ways.  Treasures are items that you can carry to help you or you can find them in your journeys.  If you want to add more then 5 points to your character you can add flaws which are worth negative points.  If you add 2 points of flaws then you would have seven points of merits you could add.  These come in three flavors.  Curses represent special liabilities of your character.  Enemies represent individuals or races with great hatred for you which if met fight with an advantage.  Weakness usually affect your stats.  Once you have created your character you can go on an adventure.

In your story pack you will find leagues which are put together to create a map. Each league has a terrain type or types, cost to enter or leave, special affects and what attribute you may recover if resting there.  In your story pack you will also find quest cards.  The quest card tells you what you are trying to achieve.  Each quest has four attributes.  These are Experience points received when the quest is achieved, Total points of waylays allowed against the quest, total points in treasures that can be seeded and the victory conditions required to complete the quest.  You will also find waylay cards in your story pack.  These will have indicators on them to tell you in what terrain you are allowed to play them in.  There is a point rating that is applied against the quests waylay rating.  Each waylay also has a test that must be passed.  Failing a waylay can have dire consequences or it may just delay you by one turn.

It is a very simple game that never plays the same way twice as long as you have a few boosters around to mix things up.

A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.

A series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.

The game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be. Long out of print, Canaletto stands up well with auction games like Medici.

This is a card game where players are promoting musical acts.

There are seven cards representing seven musical acts which are arranged in a column on the table. You get a hand of cards and each card corresponds to one of the acts. You start with one card face down in front of you. There is also a face-up pool of cards plus a draw pile.

On your turn, you turn up your face down card and play it beside the corresponding act. You then take on card from the pool and one from the deck. Finally, you place a card face down (which will be played on your next turn).

When one act gets three cards beside it, play stops for the 'Hit Parade'. Starting from top to bottom, each act moves up a number of spaces equal to the cards played beside it (this can push acts it passes down the column). The cards played are put into the pool and play continues.

The game ends when the deck runs out. You get points for the cards left in your hand - if you have cards for the act at the top of the column you get five points each, for each card for the second act you get four points, etc. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.

Or, if a player can capture a certain number of Citadel hexes, he or she wins immediately: four Citadels in a three- or four-player game, five in a two-player game. Ties are broken by adding up the combat factors of the tied players' remaining units.

Curiously, while the game features fantastic units and magic items, there is no spell casting involved.

Other games using a similar system are Tide of Fortune and the Italian Campaign series (Sicily, Salerno, Anzio and Med War).

To The Far Shore features the Allied invasion at Normandy, Operation Cobra, and the Falaise Pocket.

Scale is 1-2 days/turn (variable because of the Impulse system), 3 km/hex. Units are regiments/brigades.

The game has 2 22x34 maps, 500 counters.

The heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).

Players bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.

Losses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.

Low counter density, high maneuver. Medium-high complexity.

This game was included in Strategy  Tactics magazine #127.

The game is for two players and simulates the war between the United States and Mexico that erupted in April, 1846. Although the dispute was originally about a strip of territory between the Nueces and Rio Grande Rivers, the consequence of the war stripped Mexico of what is now much of the American southwest, including California.

The map consists of a number of important locations, each named for a city, and contains significant terrain features and numerical values for replenishment and morale. Units gain friction points as they move and represent a variety of factors: terrain, sickness, sagging morale, and lesser factors. Unit types are Infantry, Heavy and Field Artillery, Cavalry, Leaders, and Supply, with the combat units rated regular, seasoned, or conscript. A roster sheet allows for easy organization of friction point tallies, and the CRT is based on combat class. Some interesting rules involve a Mexican Invasion of the U.S., the Neutral Strip, the Polk Indecision Table, and the Veracruz Invasion.

On a turn, a player rolls eight six-sided dice up to four times, keeping dice between rolls if desired. After finishing, she claims a number card if she's rolled that number on that many dice; e.g., if she's rolled a 4 on four dice, she claims the 4 card. After claiming a card, she either starts a new stack with that card as its base or places that card on top of another card she already has  but only if that card is lower than the top card of the stack.

If a player takes a 1 card, she can place it either glass case side up on top of a stack  closing that stack (since nothing can be placed on a 1) and protecting it from being stolen  or mouse side up; a mouse side-up 1 can later be placed on a stack, and a player can have only two of these cards. When a player closes a stack with four, five or six cards, she takes a bonus card from the table, with earlier claimed bonus cards being worth more points.

If a player can't take any cards, she takes a gift card, which she can spend on a later turn to rotate a die to show a particular face. A player can hold only one gift card.

When three of the number stacks are empty, the game ends immediately. The player with the most stacks claims a 12-point bonus card, then players tally their points. Each closed stack is worth the product of the largest number in the stack and the number of cards in the stack; each open stack is worth the sum of the cards in the stack. The player with the most points wins!

There are 5 ship cards for each wind direction (north, east, south, west) with the values 3, 2, 2, 1, 1. Each game is played for 12 rounds and in every round one ship card can be 'won' by playing steering cards: Steering cards of the same wind direction as the current ship card count with their full value of points, cards with a wind direction perpendicular to that on the current ship card count with half their value and cards of the opposite wind direction count as zero points. The player who played the lowest point value gets the ship card. After 12 rounds, the player with the LEAST total of points on his collected ship cards scores the most victory points (depending on the number of players). There are, however, several possibilities to score extra victory points for certain combinations of ship cards. Thus, collecting ship cards may also be a good thing if a player can obtain the right combinations.

Players start in opposite corners of the board and create a dungeon as they move along by placing randomly chosen tiles.  The goal of the game is to reach the Treasure Chamber in the center of the board and escape back out again with some of the valuable artifacts contained therein.  There are two ways the game can end.  One way is that once someone escapes the dungeon with one of the Warlock's artifacts, they are declared the winner.  The other way is that the players set a time limit.  Once time is up, the game is over and players compare the value of the items they have accrued.  The one with the highest ranked artifact is declared the winner.  If no one has an artifact, then the player with the total highest value in items is the winner.

Players compete mainly against the board, though player-to-player conflict can happen in two rare instances.  Players earn experience points for defeating denizens of the dungeon and laying tiles in their own quadrant, and this in turn improves their combat speed.  The game components and rules are written in both English and German.

Hiring Nerds (engineers) creates better products, which attract more users, who in turn generate money. Hiring Suits (Sales) generates more money, which can be used to hire more nerds. At the end of every year the best products steals users from the other products during showdown. Employees initially are very eager to stay with a company, but over time are more likely to move to competing companies, unless they get further (monetary) incentives.

Each player starts with 2-4 products (depending on how many players there are) and four event cards. The game is played over several years. Every year each product gets one turn, i.e. every player gets to play 2-4 times per year. Players adopts users, based on the number of engineers and a die roll. Then they earn revenue, based on the number of users and the number of suits. Third, the player can use money to hire more employees. Soon, no more new hires are available, and players must steal (or poach) employees from other players. The other players try to spend their money to prevent poaching from happening. During the product show down at year's end users shift towards products that invested wisely. Outside the regular turn order, event cards can be played by any player at any time, both to further their own objectives as well as to hinder other players.

To win, a players needs to obtain the largest number of users. Players need a good mix of nerds and suits, and make smart decisions throughout the game. The constant back and forth over limited resources (employees) is different from many other resource based games and adds a lot of fun. The winning strategy depends to a large extend on guessing/reacting to other player's strategy.

Pieces are typically black and white for two-player games, and of various colours or other distinction in games of four players. In the  Royal Series edition the playing pieces are pink and yellow (not supplied with the game). It is also a two player variant only.

From a rulebook introduction:

The game of Halma is played with a number of men on a board with 256 squares. Two or four persons can play the game, or it may be played by one person as a solitaire.

In each corner of the board there are thirteen squares, called a yard, inclosed  (sic) by dotted red lines. These yards are used when four persons play. In two of the four corners of the board a heavy red line...

154642,Cinelinx: A Card Game For People Who Love Movies,2014,5.44324,74,1.5,2,6,30,60,,Card Game Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Tile Placement,"Cinelinx is a fast paced card game of connecting movies, actors, genres and more together to form cohesive links between them. With a dynamic play area based on every card played, the game constantly adapts itself to film fans of any level of skill or knowledge. Want to throw a wrench into things? Director's Cut cards can often hinder your friends or change the rules to keep things interesting. Now you finally have an outlet for that wealth of movie trivia building up in your brain!  
Cinelinx is a new take on movie trivia games and is the perfect way to test your movie knowledge and challenge your friends during your next movie or game night!


Rules
1) Separate Directors Cut cards from the main deck and set them aside nearby. Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.
2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.
3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.
4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Directors Cut card.
Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.

5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.
Example announcement: Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in The Wolf of Wall Street. 

6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. 
Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.
7) A connection can be challenged at any time.
8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.

Directors Cut
During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Directors Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw. Most Directors Cut cards can be played immediately. 
Challenging a play
If a connection is challenged and is proven VALID then the challenger must either draw a card or lose a turn. The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.
If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card. Their turn ends immediately after they draw.

The game comes with several chunky wooden fish in three different colors, with three of each color of fish, each having a different design on them consisting of either squares, circles, or triangles.

On each turn, someone rolls the two special dice. One die has colored faces, and the other die has shapes. Players look at the die roll and quickly grab the matching fish from the table! For example, if blue and square is rolled, you would want to grab the blue fish with squares on it.

However, if a player already has the matching fish in his play area, the players yell Splash Attack! and grab the red piranha. If the player that already had the matching fish is the first to do this, he gets to permanently keep the fish as a point. If a different player is quickest, however, the player loses the fish back to the center of the table. Thus, you must be the quickest to react to a matching pattern twice in a row to score. The first player to score three fish wins!

Players are given a 5-card hand and take turns laying cards (pooping) but trying not to clog the toilet! If the toilet is clogged the player must pick up the entire poop stack and a new toilet is started. If 3 cards of the same color are played in a row then the toilet is Flushed and that toilet is reset with zero poop cards. Some cards make players perform crazy acts on their turns.

POOP: The Game is an original card game created by kids and adults for kids and adults. Kids love it because of the silly designs and opportunity to make poop jokes. Adults love it because POOP makes them act like kids.

EDUCATIONAL: Younger children get a healthy dose of basic math while playing POOP. Seriously! You'll see them adding up the POOP cards to make sure they don't clog the toilet!

INTERACTION: One of the funnest stages of UNO is remembering to say UNO when down to your last card. POOP takes this one step further giving players similar responsibilities throughout the entire game. If you forget and other players remind you then you have to draw another card (and take a drink if you're playing POOP as a drinking game. Speaking of...)

DRINKING GAME FOR ADULTS: After getting feedback from our successful (and critically acclaimed) ZOMBIE SHUFFLE campaign, we learned that many people loved that we included drinking rules. For this reason we've made POOP an even easier drinking game. Players take drinks if they draw a card or clog the toilet and everyone drinks if the toilet is flushed.

ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES: We've found at least 3 other exciting ways to play POOP using the same standard deck! You'll find the Alternate Rules PDF in the downloadable Trial Version of POOP but we are very interested in what you come up with when playing with friends and family. Experiment and send us your ideas! We'll credit you if we share it with the POOP community.

1961,5 Alive,1990,5.43394,221,1.2609,2,7,30,30,,Card Game ,Hand Management,"Theme
5 Alive is an abstract card-playing game.

Goal
Each player starts with 5 lives. The winner is the last player to have any lives left.

Gameplay
Each player in turn plays a card from their hand. 'Normal' cards have a face value, and the aim is not to play a card that takes the running total above 21. If you do, you lose a life. If you manage to play the last card from your hand without taking the total above 21, then every other player loses a life. As well as 'normal' cards, there is also a variety of 'wild' cards that perform special actions, like resetting the running total, skipping the next player, reversing the direction of play or causing other players to draw extra cards.

In the game, a player rolls two dice on his turn and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.

Will the deities reward their favorite players with divine powers? Or will they favor your opponents? Only time and skill will tell.

Age of Soccer is a card and hand management style game. Players are tasked with building their team's strength by recruiting new player cards in addition to adding powerful action cards to help influence a match and defeat opponents.

At the beginning of your turn, you must choose between strengthening your squad with new player cards or strengthening your hand with new action cards. Players use special training cards to help train their team or cause trouble for their opponents. Then players battle opposing teams using special match cards, trying to defeat them and gain a vital trophy.

Once a player has defeated all other teams in the game, he is crowned the champion of Age of Soccer.

20 Ship tiles (4 aircraft carriers, 4 submarines, 4 destroyers, 4 battleships, 4 patrol boats)
8 attack dice

Battleship Express comes with two different games: The Captains Game and The Admirals Game. The Captain's Game ignore the ships powers on the cards.

Each player receives 5 ship tiles, one of each ship: Battleship, Destroyer, Aircraft Carrier, Submarine, Patrol Boat. Each player places them in front of them in any order to make up their fleet.

On a player's turn they choose one of the ships in their Fleet to attack with and move it to the front of their line. Next the player chooses a ship of an opposing player to attack. The attacking player can only choose one of the first 2 ships in the line to attack. The attacking ship tile shows how many dice to roll. Roll that number of dice and check for hits. Each of the 8 dice is the same. 5 of the sides match the colors of the 5 ships, and the sixth side is a burst or wild. IF the player does not sink it, the dice are passed to the next player.

Set aside any hits and then re-roll based on the attacking ships powers. Once the number of hits equals or exceeds the defense number on the ship that's defending, it is sunk removed from play and the attacking player gets a point. The first player to an agreed number of set points wins. Heres a breakdown of the individual ship powers:


     Battleship: Declare target. Roll all 8 dice a total of 4 times. Bursts do not count as hits.
     Destroyer: Declare target. Roll 6 dice a total of 2 times. Bursts count as 2 hits.
     Aircraft Carrier: Roll 6 dice THEN declare your target, then roll 1 more time. Bursts count as 1 hit. The Aircraft Carrier can also attack from anywhere in your line, so you dont have to move it to the front where it is vulnerable.
     Submarine: Roll 3 dice a total of one time. A single Burst will sink whatever you are attacking. Submarines can attack any ship at any place in a Fleet.
     Patrol Boat: Roll 5 dice a total of 3 times. Bursts count as 1 hit.

Recess!

A board game of pain and loss in a rough parochial school ...

Growing up is never easy ... especially in a rough parochial school where scores are settled on the playground. Between bullies stealing your lunch money, fights breaking out left and right, and schoolmates tattling to the ever-present nuns, a kid just can't catch a break ... or a kiss, as the case may be. Because you're a lover as well as a fighter, and all you really want is to steal a kiss from your sweetheart across the blacktop before the school bell rings and recess is over. The fact that you've bet the last of your lunch money on being the first do it makes it all the more risky. Of course, might makes right here on the playground. If you can't win your money back from the other kids, you can always beat it out of them.

Recess is a strategy board game for three to five players. Players each start with two boy figures and two girl figures on opposite sides of the grid-marked modular board, which is dotted with playground-themed obstacles. Children move like a rook in chess, while nuns move like a queen. A child that lands on a space occupied by another child starts a fight and takes a coin from him. Other children can break up a fight by landing on that same space, or tattle by landing on a nun's space. If a nun moves onto the fight space, the attacker is sent back to the entrance for detention. Finishing thirty of the minute-long turns marks the end of the game, or it ends immediately when one player's boy and girl figures meet on the same space while out of sight of the nuns. The resulting kiss earns two coins from each player, but to win you still have to end up with the most coins.

5002,Pro Golf,1981,5.45366,123,1.7273,1,36,60,60,,Dice Sports ,Dice Rolling,"This is a statistical simulation of PGA golf.

Each player has a Player Card that models the performance of a PGA golfer and the table uses a Course Booklet which models a famous course--the first two were Augusta National and the Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Each shot, the player rolls 2 dice and reads them low number/high number and checks his player card to determine the result of the shot  LL=Long Left, SR=Short Right, etc.  This result is checked in the course booklet to determine where the ball landed and the club  (i.e. the column on his player card:  FW, LI, MI, SI, CH, PITCH, SD) that will be used for his next shot and any penalty for being in the rough/trees/sand/etc.  Occasionally, an option will be given to the player to layup or Go for the Green!  using a longer club.

If a number comes up, the player is on the green and the number determines the distance left on his putt.  For putting, if the number rolled on the putting column is greater than or equal to the distance left to the pin, the putt is good.  Otherwise, unless the putt is badly missed (which checks another Second Putt Card to determine the length of the next putt), the second putt is assumed to always good.

Record the score for the hole.  Repeat 17 more times for entire round.

The goal is to reach the Fireball in the center with no Challenge Cards.  You must play these on other players to get rid of them.  Each one has a tongue-twister, riddle, logic question, or tough knowledge bit on it.  If they're wrong, discard the question, and the next person goes.  If they are right, he or she gives you a card and you discard the played one.

Black Hole cards are the comedy part of the game: when you land on one, have a person read it to you and do whatever the outcome is, after everyone is finished laughing.

So it's a race to get rid of cards and get to the middle.  If you still have cards when you get to the Fireball, YOU must answer all of your cards in a row without missing to win.

Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.

When the insatiable appetite of Killer Bunnies game fans demanded more, Playroom looked to Killer Bunnies creator and game designer Jeffrey Neil Bellinger to coordinate the development of, like other games in the Killer Bunnies family, a non-collectible game that can offer variations through different color nick-named deck options. However, this time a new desire expressed by the huge Killer Bunnies fan-base has been fulfilled: Killer Bunnies now has a constructable game variation. Though still not collectible or random, players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey  six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.

The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.

Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is the latest in the family of Killer Bunnies games which features, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, Killer Bunnies REMIX, Kinder Bunnies: Their First Adventure and Killer Bunnies and the Journey to Jupiter.

By airplane to Paris? By ship to Barcelona? Or by car or train to Milan? No matter how you do it, travel throughout Europe! With a good plan, the correct tickets, and some luck in your luggage, you'll lead a travel party to multiple destinations and use insider tips to make side trips. A slew of information in words and pictures for 155 cities is awaiting your visit!

The players travel by car, train, ship and airplane from city to city and control private and public destinations with three travel companies. The goal is to visit as many destinations as possible in six differently colored regions. Whenever a player reaches a destination, he lays the corresponding city card in front of himself. The game ends when a player has at least ten city cards (or nine cards with five or six players) in six different colors before himself, although the round is played to its end. The winner is the player who visited the most destinations in all six colored regions.

New game mechanisms: Europareise possesses novel game mechanisms that differ from the familiar travel games in the Ravensburger catalog (Deutschlandreise, Weltreise). Movement doesn't come from dice, but rather from tickets for planes, ships, trains, and cars. To keep the lines from tangling on the gameboard, no flight lines or ship lines are marked on the gameboard. The players travel from a ship's harbor with a ship chain to any harbor within reach of the ship chain. Travel by airplane is done similarly.

Beer flows freely, but not even the cellars of Byggvir, the God of Beer, could quench the thirst of Nordland's greatest warriors. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Not a single step back is allowed to the warrior who wishes to enter Valhalla. One single thought in everyone's mind: may Fenrir eat the sun, that beer will be mine! All vikings laugh at the thought of death, draw their war axes, joining the fight at the call of OOOODIIIIIIIIIIN!

In Beer  Vikings you are a fierce and thirsty viking warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of beer. The winner is the most drunk viking  in game terms, the player who has collected the most beer drink counters  at the end of the sudden death round.

Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the war axe. Each drink of beer prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the beer you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much beer, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the cup is empty and the sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Loki, the thirsty god of evil, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their beer. Raise your glasses (and your axes)!

Beer  Vikings introduces 112 brand new cards! including a new type of cards called Valhalla which provide you a strong ability during the match  but to obtain them you need to kill an opponent. Thus, to gain this power you must generate a vengeful spirit first. Be careful when you follow the Valhalla way...

The player who popped the pig receives no points, while the other players get points equal to the number of chips they had in the pig.

131982,We Are Dead: Zombie Mall Massacre,2014,5.23154,65,1.5,2,5,60,60,,Zombies ,Hand Management,"We Are Dead: Zombie Mall Massacre! The board game where you and your friends take on the role of the shambling zombie horde. Your goal is simple: turn as many mall shoppers as you can into zombies. Achieving your goal is not simple. Human Heroes attempt to put you down permanently and the roaming horde of your victims is trying to eat up your food supply.

We Are Dead is for 2-5 people ages 13+ and plays in about an hour.

Art for the game was done by two amazing artists, Mike Morris and Mike Collins. I cannot rave enough about how well they brought the vision for this game to life (or unlife).

Players take turns attempting to attack the mall shoppers trying to satisfy their recently unlocked hunger for humans. Players will use attack cards from their hands and infection tokens they receive to defeat heroes and turn the humans.

During other players' turns each opponent will have the opportunity to play hero cards in the hopes of stopping the player. This interaction during other players' turns reduces down time and keeps all players engaged in the game.

While players are busy with their own struggles, the horde grows from their victims. When the Horde! card appears the players must work together to make sure they do not all lose to the massive horde.

We Are Dead is easy to learn, but provides enough depth and random elements to allow for good replay-ability. The game uses a hand management mechanic with elements of co-op play and resource management that add layers of strategy to the game.

One player takes a card and reads the category (Place / Events / Person / Thing / Side Track) and the clues one at a time, and other players try to guess the answer. The six clues on a card may be read in any order. The clue reader may give the hardest/most vague clue first.

The fewer clues you need, the farther you will move forward. Players move ahead seven minus the number of clues read before they gave the answer. If a player only needed one clue, they move six spaces. If they needed all six clues, they move one space. The player who solved the clue becomes the next clue reader. If no one solved the card, it passes to the left.

Players have two free guesses at the beginning of their score track, and one free guess once they enter the red zone. After that, they move back one space for each incorrect guess.

If a player lands on a space with a triangle, they draw a Venture card and follow the instructions. If they land on a red space with an arrow, they fall back to the space indicated.

The first player to reach the center of the board wins. It does not have to be by exact count.

A game consists of ten rounds. In each round the players attempt to cover one of the ten rows on their scoreboard with tiles, trying to score the maximum number of points as they do so. The board is established by laying the tiles face down on the table in a rectangular grid.

On a player's turn, they turn over any three tiles. The player then picks one of the 10 rows (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) on their scoreboard and places one, two, or three of the tiles on their scoreboard, provided they fit. Any tiles that can't be used are left on the table and turned over again where they are. No tiles may be added to or removed from a row on a scoreboard that contains only one or two tiles. If none of the tiles turned up can fit on a free row, the player must declare one of his free rows invalid by placing one of the tiles turned up face down on the first square of the row (the others are returned to the table face down).

Game ends after the tenth round, and the winner is the one with the most points.

As described in the rules there are 2 CUPONK (Ping Pong with graphics) balls and a 30 Card Trick Deck that the player draws from, it illustrates a specific trick to attempt and the number of tries to complete it.

If the player completes the trick in the amount of tries given they collect the card and the next player draws a new trick.  If the player fails to complete the trick in the number of tries, then the next player attempts the same trick.  Follow the same rules for completing the trick.  If all players fail, then discard the trick and move on to the next trick card, it would now be the original first player's turn again.

You can play until any preset goal you want, first to three tricks, five tricks, or until the deck is gone and count up the totals.  The game even recommends combining 2 or more trick cards into Expert tricks.

Each of the three versions has their own trick deck, so if you purchased all three you can combine them into one 90 card deck.  Also included are blank cards for making up your own.
It's actually way more fun than you would think, and the cup lights up and makes sound effects unique to the version you purchased.  The cards are really just stepping stones to making your own even more elaborate tricks.

Each player chooses which of her/his thieves to make active, knowing which thieves are in every player's den (and knowing that they know which cards s/he is choosing between).  Guessing which thief another player is making active can help block and/or steal from that other player.  Players bluff and back stab their way to victory, using the lower class thieves in the city -- including the Pickpocket, the Urchin, and the Woman of Easy Virtue. The game can be combined with Rival Den of Thieves for richer play. The game can accommodate 2-5 players -- up to 10 with a second deck or Rival Den of Thieves added.

You can roll at most three times, so knowing when to keep your result or gamble for a better one is the difference between victory and defeat.

Players record these points on an individual scoring board with tracks for each color, and the first player to move all colors to seven points wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points  thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.

Einfach Genial: Das Wrfelspiel was originally released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges. It is a slightly smaller version: here the score pad only goes 1 to 7.

Each player starts the game with three gold(ish) doubloons and a hand of four cards; most cards are divided into two sections, with the sections indicating one of four pirate icons, open water, a ghost ship or a kraken. Some cards contain actions  e.g., cannon, plunder  that can be played against an opponent.

On a turn, a player draws two cards, then plays two cards. Cards are placed to form a grid on the playing area. A pirate icon can cover a pirate icon of the same type; a ghost ship is wild and counts as all pirate icons, and can cover and be covered by any pirate icon; open water can cover or be covered by any pirate icon or a ghost ship. A kraken can be covered only by a ghost ship, although a cannon can remove it from play.

Your goal is to create three Xs in the playing area that feature your secret icon. As soon as you (or an opponent) create an X, whether connected orthogonally or disagonally, you mark the center space with one of your doubloons. The first player to place her three doubloons on the board wins.

In Voodoo Mania, each player starts with a hand of three cards and a reserve ingredient pile of 18-45 cards, depending on the number of players. One card starts in the center of the table. Each card is double-sided, and each side features four of five symbols on it (mask, amulet, voodoo doll, magic potion and top hat) in four of five colors.

All players play at the same time, trying to play their cards in hand. To play a card, the card must depict the symbol missing from the top card of the discard pile in the missing color or it must also be missing the same symbol in the same color. In the latter case, the player laying down the card says Voodoo! and all other players must draw a card from the bottom of the discard pile and place it on the bottom of their personal ingredient pile. Then all players start playing again.

At any time, a player can place a card from his hand on the bottom of his ingredient pile, then draw the top card of this pile. Whenever a player plays a card, he draws a replacement card to keep three cards in hand.

When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and everyone scores one point for each card still in hand or in the pile. After three rounds, the player with the fewest points wins.

On their turn, a player rolls all four dice. They may roll up to three times, re-rolling all, some, or none of the dice.


     If you roll 4 of a kind, or a run of four (aka a small straight - 1, 2, 3, 4 or 2, 3, 4, 5 or 3, 4, 5, 6) you can move a pawn up a level, and either take another turn, or move one of your opponent's pawns down to the lowest level. If you roll one of these combinations on your first roll, you may move a pawn, move your opponent's pawn, and take another turn.



     If you roll 3 of a kind, a run of three, or two pairs, you may move a pawn up a level.



     If you roll a pair, you may not move a pawn, but are not penalized. Your turn ends.



     If you do not roll any of these combinations, you must move your highest pawn down to the starting level.


Pawns can only be moved to the next level if there are at least two pawns on the starting level. (The lowest pawn may move up without needing another pawn.)

Each step of the pyramid has one fewer spot for a pawn, so a pawn must go on ahead, or be left behind, making for some strategy and tension.

Once you reach the top, you drop your pawn through a hole, and it is safe. It can no longer be moved back down to the starting level. The first player to get all five of their pawns to the top wins the game.

The goal of the game is to collect the biggest share of different kinds of treasures; preferentially by lying, tricking and trading.

The ship Little Blue is sailing from island to island, on a hunt for treasures and riches. There are 7 people on board: The Captain himself, the captains close friend Albert, the Digger who will dig for the treasures, the Gunner who will keep the natives at an arms reach from the adventurers, the untrustworthy Boatsman, and, of course, two Mutineers who are just waiting for the right moment to seize command of the ship.
Every time the ship reaches a new island, the Captain must choose one other crew member to take with him ashore to find treasures. The others must stay behind and look after the ship.

The Captain, however, is a very old and senile man. His eyesight is bad, and on top of that, it is a very dark and foggy night. So it is very difficult for him to know who is who among the crew members. To get ashore with the Captain, and get a fair (?) share of the treasures, the crew members are willing to do whatever it takes to fool the poor Captain: Including lying, tricking and conspiring.

But rather than just finding a toasty spot in the sun and enjoying it, you're worried about everyone else horning in on your patch of paradise. Time to apply Sunblock to see whether you can force other aspiring sunbathers off the sand with their heads hanging in shame.

To start the game, players set up the beach, complete with a large umbrella for shade, four beach chairs and four rubbish bins. On a turn, the player rolls the die, then takes one of the following actions:

 Add a yellow, red or blue umbrella to the beach.
 Move the big umbrella, which takes up four pips on the board, to a new location.
 Move your beach chair to a new location, but not adjacent to a rubbish bin.
 Move a rubbish bin to a new location; anyone who now has a chair adjacent to this bin must move the chair to a new location.

If you knock something off the beach or can't move or place an item on the board as directed, you lose the game and must head home. The last player left on the beach wins. Variants include a crab that blocks off additional spaces as it moves around the beach and more moving umbrellas.

It begins with Argentina in control of the Falkland Islands and UK forces approaching to try to retake them.

Aircraft counters represent four aircraft of one particular type. Ground-unit counters represent infantry battalions (500 to 600 men), artillery battalions (12 to 18 guns with crews), armored reconnaissance squadrons (eight to 12 vehicles and their crews), a heavy machinegun company (120 men with heavy machineguns), and special forces teams (25 to 50 men). Ship and submarine counters each represent one vessel.

Each turn represents between one to three days, depending on the current operational tempo. Each inch on the Tactical Area Map equals five miles. Each inch on the Strategic Sea Area Map equals 100 miles. The game uses an adaptation of the system originally created for our Red Dragon Rising game.

Special rules cover such things as: Operation Black Buck, decisive leadership, Exocet missiles, stealth aircraft, reinforcements, off-map areas, naval transport, airbase limits, submarine operations, strategic airlift, rebasing, ship repair, special forces raids, the Total Exclusion Zone, aerial interception, cross-decking, naval surface actions, ground assault, heliborne movement, the Argentine mainland, protected targets, entrenchments, mountain combat, severe weather, and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.

I. UK Operations Phase
II. AR Operations Phase
III. UK Submarine Phase
IV. AR Submarine Phase
V. Random Event Phase

89569,Uskoci: A Card Game of Croatian Pirates,2010,5.64512,82,1.6429,2,6,30,30,Party Thematic,Card Game Pirates ,Card DraftingHand ManagementSet CollectionSimulationVariable Phase Order,"It is the year of our Lord 1603. The Uskok Warlord Radoslav died during the last Venetian raid. All the Uskok leaders, including you, were invited to Nehaj, the unconquerable Uskok fortress, in order to choose their next Warlord.

Dark storm clouds loomed over the stone fortress, its walls battered by the bitter nothern gales, and yet the Uskok leaders could not come to an agreement. Mighty warriors though they were, none of them had proved to be enough to their comrades, so no Warlord had been chosen. As midnight struck, the debate was cut short by a shot from a flintlock. The hall went silent. The old sea dog Stipe spoke: According to ancient customs, if no agreement is reached by midnight, the title of Warlord shall go to the first lord who collects enough loot to fill twenty-five Uskok vessels. So it was written, and so it was done.

Uskoci were a historical pirate band in the 16th century who lived and prospered by being a nuisance for much more powerful opponents, but never on such a scale to provoke full-scale retaliation. Uskoci: The card game of Croatian pirates takes that idea of heart as players need to demonstrate both their skill as a pirate and restraint comparable to the historical Uskoci to prove the best captain among your peers.

In the basic game, players must combine treasures (valued 1-9) on their pile until they total exactly 25; what makes this difficult are the 14 event cards (Venetians, traitors, storms) that can mess with a player's plans or change the value of a treasure, but thankfully they can also protect you. The more complex game adds card drafting to the mix, with the player who has the least treasure on the table drafting the most cards.

The rules in both games are for 3-6 players, with modifications that allow two players to go head-to-head.

Climate negotiations can be so simple! Those lagging behind learn from the front runners how to finally protect the climate. And those who suffer most from climate-induced storms etc. join forces. The bigger the conference the better, however, some countries will just not stop negotiating.

Players are climate diplomats who try to organize conferences for like-minded countries. On the one hand, they want the conferences to be as big as possible. On the other hand players who are the first to have no countries left also have chances to win the game. Hence, at some point it makes sense to hand over countries to more competent colleagues, or to collect as many countries as possible in order to hold at least one big conference ...

Gameplay:

Players take turns. In your turn you play a challenge, asking all players to compare one card each from their hands in a category you choose. The lowest value wins all cards. Afterwards you may play a conference of like-minded countries. However, two participating countries are always discontent and thus return to your discard pile. All other participants leave and score for you. Hence, the bigger the conference is the better.

Contents:

o 60 country cards, each of which represents a government delegation. The card informs about the country's capital, the UNFCCC-group and alliances resp. country groups it belongs to at the climate negotiations as well as the risk groups it belongs to in the different categories. Besides, the card shows how many diplomacy points you can score for making the country's delegation content.

Each player has four knight pieces and one king piece.  At the beginning of the game they are placed in the row furthest from the dividing wall.  Players take turns moving one of their pieces one space (orthogonally).  They then get to use their air catapult to try to pop out one of their opponent's pieces.  This is done by placing their plunger in one of the vacant spaces on their side of the board and then banging it.  If their opponent has a piece in that corresponding space, it will pop up into the air.  Pieces captured in this way remain out of the game until that player moves his king up to the dividing wall, at which point he can claim a captured knight piece back (but also tips off his opponent that his king is in the front row).  The first player to move two pieces into the front row (next to the dividing wall) wins the game.

This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.

The three dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice with three marked sides and one blank side. A throw of three marked sides means move 5 squares or enter 1 piece and throw again. Throwing three blank sides means move 4 squares and throw again. A throw of two marked and one blank side means move 1 square and throw again. Throwing two blank and one marked side means the turn ends.

There are three special types of space on the board. Landing on a Bonus Double space allows you to move your piece forward by the same amount that you moved there with. Landing on a Bonus Rosette square allows you to move one piece onto the board. Landing on a Penalty Eye square allows the opponent to move one of his pieces 4 spaces.

First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.

8966,Raid on Richmond,1991,5.06364,33,2.6,2,2,360,360,Wargames,American Civil War Wargame ,Chit-Pull System,"The game is a what-if of Kilpatrick's aborted cavalry strike against the Confederate capital in early 1864.

Two 22 x 24 maps, 300 counters; Rules Book, 6-sided die

From Decision Games' Website:

This is one of the most challenging and unusual American Civil War games ever published. the map is an accurate reproduction of the city streets and blocks of Richmond in 1864. Units moving using the actual historical map features.

In February 1864, US Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick conceived a bold stroke against the Confederate capital, which local Union sympathizers had correctly reported as wide open to attack. The goals of the raid were to release the thousands of Union prisoners of war held in Libby Prison and on Belle Isle, as well as inflicting damage on key Rebel installations like the Tredegar Iron Works. Secret orders also authorized the killing of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and burning the city to the ground.

Historically, at the last minute, Kilpatrick lost his nerve and withdrew without firing a shot. The game begins at that point, but with the assumption the Union commander's nerve holds. As the Union raiders enter the city, it's a race against time as they seek to commandeer transport for the sick, wreak destruction across Richmond as slaves and panicked civilians fill the streets, and escape before Confederate army reinforcements begin pouring in from all directions.

Then 26 real pawns are placed randomly on the board. The goal of the game is to catch the most real pawns.
Each player on turn tries to take a pawn. If it comes free, the player keeps it. It is a memory game, because you have to remember where the fake pawns are if you want to take the real ones. It is also a game of observation and dexterity, because when taking, or trying to take, a pawn, you often touch the neighbouring ones, and make them move or quiver a little bit.

1063,Schraumen,1992,5.26479,71,1.1667,3,8,60,60,,,,"Schraumen is a card game based on a nonsense culture, enacting nonsensical laws written on scrolls, paid for with plums.  The name of the game is a portmanteau word from the German Schriftrollen (Scrolls) and Pflaumen (plums).

The 77 scroll cards are shuffled and the top 11 removed from the game without looking at them.  Deal each player three scrolls and give each player seven plum tokens, which are both money for bidding and victory points at the end of the game.

Each scroll is a rule of the game that must be followed when the scroll is played.  If a rule cannot be followed, the scroll is burned in the fire - that is, removed from the game.  Examples include, Each player must put three plums in the garden, if at least one player has fewer than three plums.  Or, The player with the most plums must give all other players a plum, if two or more players are tied for having the most plums.

Players take turns reading the scrolls they wish, enacting the new laws, all of which involve plum distribution in some way.  You don't have to enact any of your scrolls unless you have more than five, at which point you MUST activate (or burn, if illegal) enough to bring your hand down to five cards.  A player then draws a scroll, reads it silently, and auctions it off without telling the others what's on it.  He may bid for it himself.

The game ends when either all scrolls are taken or when the text of a read scroll requires the game to end.  The player with the most plums wins.

Players play the part of sheriffs in the Old West, each trying to capture the highest value collection of outlaws in their jails.

Your jail (aka Calaboose) is a collection of cards kept face up on the table in front of you.  Jails can only hold 5 outlaws at any one time, and each outlaw has a strength rating.

On your turn, you can either place an outlaw from your hand into an empty slot in your jail or into someone else's jail.  The outlaws each have power ratings.  An outlaw can be sent to replace a weaker outlaw in someone else's jail.

You can defend your jail.  If someone sends an outlaw to your jail, you can eliminate him with one of your outlaws - but you have to send your defender to someone else's jail.  That person can defend against you, of course, so each turn has the possibility of generating a chain reaction that involves multiple players around the table.

It's a lighthearted social game with a solid core of strategy. Higher value cards tend to be weaker, and sets (or gangs) are worth much more than singletons.  Everyone at the table can see what's in your jail, so as you gain the advantage you also acquire a bullseye. Attacking another player's jail may backfire on you, so you have to be careful and constantly adjust your strategy to the cards on the table.

In 7 Safari, players participate on a wild animal adventure. The mission of each player is to scout the jungle and collect as many different animals as possible, for as many points. You turn over a face-down card on a grid of cards, and replace it with a card from your hand. The catch is that each row and each column may never have more than one of each animal. Animals have different point values on their cards, and only one card will count positive points - more than one of a type will count negative points at the end. Hyenas, however are always negative.

Originally Published in German as Alles fr die Katz:
The title means Everything for the Cat and may have an idiomatic meaning of all for nothing.

In Alles fr die Katz The animals in the zoo are loose and players must attempt to collect one of each type out of a face down grid which represents the zoo, but must avoid collecting any black cats which do not belong in the zoo. Adults should be sure to use the Advanced Rules to ensure an interesting game. Otherwise, the rules are the same as the English version (7 Safari).

Basic and Advanced variants allow 2 to 4 players, with up to 8 in a variant for children.

Each player has two ships on a square grid board. The number of moves a ship may make is based on the direction the ship is traveling relative to the wind. Moves can consist of advancing forward one square or turning 90 degrees. Wind changes randomly every time a three minute timer expires before a player's turn.

Each ship begins the game with three magnetic prize disks representing the ship's strength. Ships may fire when their broadside is facing an adjacent or nearby enemy ship. The number of dice rolled depends on each ship's strength (i.e. the number of prize disks). If the attacker's top roll is higher than the defender's top roll, the defender is deprived of a prize disk.

Prize disks can be recovered by spending repair cards. Each player starts with a fixed number of repair cards and they are never refilled. Optional advanced rules include the drawing of random effects cards on each attack, attacking enemy repair ports, boarding damaged ships, mists that provide sanctuary from attack, and ramming.

You know, somehow, that you're in a sanitarium, but you don't know why you know, or how you got here.  All you want to do is escape.  Dark hallways extend in all directions, and the shadows themselves seem to swirl and twist menacingly.  Fear and confusion grips you, but before you succumb to insanity, a memory returns.  Safe things...things that you need...things that will make you whole, and let you escape.  They are what you need to find, what you must find...

Sanitarium is a card-driven horror escape game.  At the start of the game, each player is dealt three to six (of 13, depending on the number of players) 'Safe Things' cards.  Finding those specific items will allow escape from the Sanitarium.

The cards form the map of the winding hallways, items scattered all over.  Players must explore the layout (which will differ with each play) to find items that provide them useful powers, and also their Safe Things.  Dark Hallways within the Sanitarium will spawn shadows, which will in turn chase the players.  Getting caught by a shadow might earn you a hallucination.  Hallucinations...are bad.

The enemy of the players is time.  The deck of item and event cards is the timer for the game -- when it runs out, everyone still inside succumbs to their madness!

Sanitarium is fast-paced and easy to learn.  It plays in 30-45 minutes.  Coop, competitive, and solo scenarios are all provided.

87748,GUAR Fantasy,2010,5.25161,31,2,2,8,20,20,,Card Game Fantasy Party Game ,Card Drafting,"INTRODUCTION:
Table Land is populated by humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs and barbarians. It is a world in permanent war for the control of the territory. Play and become a true Lord of Tierra Mesa by beating your rivals.

AIM OF THE GAME:
The aim of the game is to achieve, before the other players, a combination of 5 cards with the same value, or to form an army with 5 consecutive cards of the same race or where each value accords a different race (Unbeatable Run).

You will become Lord of Table Land in several ways:
1.    Gathering together an army of 5 consecutive cards (run) of the same race.
2.    Gathering together 5 cards of the same value (archers, princesses, catapults)
3.    And finally, the Unbeatable Run; you can get an army alliance gathering 5 consecutive cards of a different race each.

The winner is the player who gathers one of these combinations.

BEFORE THE GAME:
-    Shuffle the cards.
-    Hand out 5 cards to each player.
-    Allocate the deck of cards facing down, in the middle of Table Land.
-    The first game starts with the player who owns most hairs in his ears, continuing then, in a clockwise direction. The following games are started by the winner of the previous game.

Once all the cards have been distributed to the players the game stars. The player that starts the game draws one card from the central deck, looks at it, and gets rid of the card which is not convenient for him. Each player should always have 5 cards.

Each player discards should be placed on Table Land, ALWAYS in front of the player, creating a deck where the last discarded card is shown. This way there should be as many discarded decks as players.

When a player gets rid of a card and puts it on its deck facing up, any interested player can take it. How? The interested player should cover it with its hand. The fastest player covering the deck is the one that gets the card. This player should then discard one of his cards. Then, the game continues in a clockwise direction starting from him.

This way the game continues until one of the players gathers 5 cards with the same value or 5 consecutive cards of the same race or the Unbeatable Run. The player should let the other players know during his turn by placing the discard card facing down and by showing his 5 wining cards, he gains the victory by beating his rivals.

WINING COMBINATIONS:

Option 1  Whoever wins 5 games is the winner of the whole game.

Option 2  After each game all card points must be counted, except those from the winner, being 100 points those from the action cards. The player with fewer points after 5 games is the winner.

Option 3  After each game only the winners points must be counted, in this situation the value (each value corresponds to a different race) of the Unbeatable Run is three times the addition of the values. The game finishes when one of the players reaches 1000 points or a previously agreed quantity.

These are not the only possibilities, players can agree on other options for victory.

ACTION CARDS:

This game has a series of action cards which are used for the interaction between players to threaten their rivals:

Skull (2 cards): If a player places this card on the other players deck it means that all his troops have been killed. He must place all his cards, facing down, beneath the central deck and draw 5 new cards.

card swap (1 card): If a player places this card in another players deck, both players must swap one card.

hand swap (1 card): Placing this card in another players discard deck means that you swap your hand of cards with that player.

steal 2 cards for the deck (2 cards): Placing this card on to other players discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the attacking card) randomly takes 2 cards from the other players hand, and then this player must immediately pick up two new cards from the central deck. The 2 cards that have been taken from the players hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.

steal 3 cards for the deck (1 card): Placing this card in another players discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 3 cards from his rivals hand. Then, the rival should draw 3 new cards from the central deck. The cards taken from his hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.

steal a card (3 cards): Placing this card in another players discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 1 card from his rivals hand, and keeps it. Now the victim has 4 cards, therefore he must pick up a new card to have 5. The assailant has now 6 cards therefore he must discard one of them to have 5 again to continue the battle.

Potion (2 cards): the joker substitutes any other card concerning value and race. It can NOT be used as action card. One player can have on its hand up to two jokers.

FAQs:

- Which discard cards can I pick up? You can only pick up the last card that has been placed at the top of the discard deck from the player thats on its turn.

- After an action card who continues? The player next to the player who has discarded the Action Card, always clockwise.

- Do runs or the Unbeatable Run have to start from number 5? Runs do not have to start from 5, as long as they are always consecutive numbers.

- What should it be done if the extension of Tierra Mesa cannot be cover and a player does not reach their rivals discard decks? Instead of hunting the card with the hand you should scream Guar!!! The one that screams it first takes the card.

- Can I draw one card from any discard deck while other player is drawing a card from the central deck? When a player picks up a card from the central deck the possibility of taking a card from a discard deck is blocked.

- If I take a card from a discard deck, can the card that appears underneath be taken later on? NO. Those cards were previously played, therefore, you should pay attention!!

- What should it be done when the central deck finishes? All discard decks from all the players must be gathered together to form a new central deck. The cards must be shuffle before placing them on the middle of Tierra Mesa.

- If two players place their hands on a discard deck, who takes the card? Either the one that has more fingers placed on it, or the most aggressive one.

147721,Karnickel,2013,5.32661,109,1.1429,2,4,15,15,,Animals Children's Game Dice Racing Trains ,Modular BoardPress Your LuckRoll / Spin and Move,"Everybunny knows that rabbits love the countryside  and carrots, of course! The best carrots of all grow between the train tracks, but you have to keep an eye out for trains! Roll the dice and hop your rabbit to the best carrot patch; as long as you don't need to flee out of the path of the train, you can happily nibble away. Chomp, chomp, chomp...

In Karnickel, each player places his rabbit on the circular train track made of eight interchangeable tiles, sets the train engine on its start space, then takes turns rolling the custom dice. After you roll, set any die that shows the train out of play, then count up how many times each of the player colors appears on the remaining dice; you must move one of the rabbits (yours or another player's) clockwise around the track the full number of spaces. You then pass the rabbit dice to the next player. Players take turns, each time rolling only the dice passed to them and hopping the rabbits from tile to tile, trying to land on the tiles where they will be able to collect the most carrots.

When a player rolls only trains, the rabbit hopping has to stop as the train is ready to move! That player rerolls all seven dice, counts up the number of trains rolled, then moves the train that many spaces around the track. Every rabbit on a tile that the train moves through is scared away by the engine and hops off the track, failing to collect any carrots this time. All rabbits still on the track after the train moves  either because the train didn't reach them or because they were on one of the two tunnel tiles  get to grab 1, 2 or 3 carrots...or maybe lose one  exploding carrots are a risk!

Everyone then hops back onto the track, and the next player rolls all the dice to start a new round of play. Whoever has the most carrots when one player has at least eight carrots wins!

Chicago is played in a city in which the bars and casinos are being fought over. The winner is the person who succeeds at one of the following three goals, and can stay that way up through the end of a game phase.

- The owner of 3 of the 4 casinos,
- The owner of all 8 bars in the central square,
- The owner of 5 thugs with 4 rings each.
If no one manages to reach a goal by the end of the 24th turn, the winner is the player with the biggest fortune.

The board shows a map with streets and buildings. Each Quarter has the same layout, with the central place in the middle of the board. Bars and Casinos: Each bar is a space. Each Quarter has a casino and 22 bars of different values but each Quarter has an overall value of 72,000.

Players can use thugs to help control a Quarter

A  game of Chicago runs at most 4 phases (a-d). In each phase, there are 6 rounds.

End of a phase:
At the end of each set of 6 game turns, a phase ends. All players receive the value of bars and casinos they own. Each player counts the value of their buildings marked with their chips. The player then gets that value in cash.

Game End: The game ends when a player has achieved one of the goals at the end of a phase. If the game makes it to the end of phase D, and no one has reached a goal, the game ends. Players receive income from bars and casinos, then the player with the most money wins. The value of thugs is added to cash on hand to determine the winner.

The players are racing to win a bet as to whom will collect the most Roman helmets. You move from the Roman camp (which gets you 3 cards) to the village and back until the deck is exhausted. There are obstacles in the way: Assurancetourix the Bard makes you flee back three spaces with his atrocious singing, and you trip over the menhirs, losing a card. A small Roman cohort can be hit to garner an extra card.

When two players end up in the same space, there can be a tussle, with one card --picked randomly-- being swapped. The real strategy comes in deciding which of the two dice to use: the slow one (1-4) or the fast one (3-6). When using the fast one, any player can cry out Exchange! and swap his hand for yours...

The 48 Roman cards are worth from 1 to 5 helmets each, but there are a fair number of red cards bearing non-helmets (caligae, shields, pilums, etc) which score from -1 to -5. So beware!

Find hidden bombs and dismantle them, help hostages into safety, or take out terrorist leaders. Due to the high variation in goals, targets, threats and specific circumstances, players need to choose their set-up and strategy each time they start a mission or a campaign. Don't just throw in grenades with your buster at public places such as airports and train stations, or else civilians might get hurt, resulting in negative points on your mission balance. (Plus, you know, injuring civilians is not cool.) Develop your primary skill, but don't neglect your attack power, defense power and other skills if you want to stay alive in this thrilling new game.

Countdown: Special Ops is fully modular, with players being able to create their own game by adjusting four different aspects of play:


     Game situations: With more than 200 playing cards, the challenges and threats are different each time you play.
     Game mode: You can play a single mission, a campaign or a scenario; each game mode has its own level and duration, and you're advised to start with a single mission on the lowest level (green).
     Level up: Did you succeed a few times on level green? If so, you might want to try the next (orange) level or even a scenario, that is, three missions in a row with increasing difficulty!
     Goals: Even players' goals can be altered. Countdown: Special Ops is a co-operative game, but if you'd like to change the rules, you could add one or two traitors to the team and play Traitor Mode.


Development
You can develop your own Special Op by improving his or her skills. This is done in scenario or campaign play. This brings out interesting aspects of the game in which you have to choose how many risk you want to take to gain extra experience or if you want to move slow and stay alive at all cost...

This variation, combined with the 30-minute time limit per mission, makes the experience of a mission feel like an actual PC game in many aspects. Smart development is essential to survive the missions on higher threat levels.

Anvil-Dragoon: Southwall 1944 is a simulation of the Allied invasion of France during WWII. It covers the time period from August 14th (D-Day minus 1) through September 12 (official date of the linkup between Dragoon and Overlord forces).

Before the dawn of August 15th, 1944, British and American paratroopers of the First Airborne Task Force jumped into three drop zones around an obscure village near Draguignan in southern France, and began one of the most controversial invasions of WWII. The campaign was to see the isolation of all western France, the opening of two major supply ports, and the netting of 79,000 prisoners, but it ultimately failed in it's most ambitious and important goal: that of cutting off and eliminating most of the German Army Task Group G defending the coast.

3626,Demons,1979,5.33226,106,2,1,4,60,60,Wargames,Fantasy Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterVariable Player Powers,"(from the instruction manual)

Demons is a game of demonic conjuration and treasure hunting for one to four players based on the medieval and ancient manuscripts comprising the Lamegeton.  The players take the roles of magicians questing after treasure in medieval Armenia.  The mortal powers of Armenia automatically pursue the magicians whose major defense is their ability to conjure fearsome demons.

(paraphrased from the Historical Notes section of the instruction manual)

The basic story of the key of Solomon holds that when Solomon was building the first temple in Jerusalem, one of his workers was seized by an evil spirit.  The archangel Michael appeared and delivered to Solomon a magical ring which gave him the power to command all spirits.  Solomon commanded the spirits into a brass vessel, which he sealed and cast into a lake in Babylonia.  Solomon had foreseen the possibility of the demons being released again and had prepared a testament detailing the various rituals and instruments that could be prepared by any person to command the spirits once more.  This power was to have been used for curing disease and preventing harm, but when printed examples appeared again in the 17th century the emphasis had switched to the finding of treasure and personal gain by the magician instead.

You must clear your hand of 10 cards, by placing successive cards face down on the deck, bluffing as necessary. So the deck is started by a player laying 1s, the next player lays 2s, one by one and so on. At some point, your bluff is called. If you were false, draw more cards. If you were true, your opponent draws. There are action cards, including a sack of lies which has no value and so you must lie when playing it.

Playing Scheinheilig your goal is to get rid of the cards in your hand.
In total, there are 70 cards numbered evenly from 1 to 10, 26 Angels (Jokers), 8 Devils (dont want those) and 8 skip a turn-cards. Every player starts the game with 10 cards and play proceeds clockwise.
The youngest player starts and has to discard cards with the number 1 face down. At least he has to pretend to discarded 1s. A player can put down any number of cards. The next player can then either accept whatever was just discarded and discard 2s on his own or he can question one of the cards just discarded and turn it face up. If he was right and card does not show the correct number, the player who tried to discard a wrong card has to take back the questioned card and all cards on top of it. On top of that he has to roll the die and draw that many cards from the deck. If the questioned card had the correct number, the questioning player has to roll the die and draw that many cards. Angels are always considered the correct number, Devils never. Whenever it is your turn, you can also just draw a card and end your turn. Whoever gets rid of all cards first, wins.

98203,Redakai,2011,5.54433,97,1.7273,2,2,20,20,Customizable,Card Game Collectible Components Fantasy Fighting Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Hand ManagementVariable Player Powers,"Redakai is a trading card game using the characters and setting of an animated series of the same name that debuted on the Cartoon Network in the U.S. in 2011.  Redakai cards have Blast 3D technology, making them appear 3D, as well as making attacks appear to animate as the player moves the card.

In Redakai, a player is trying to eliminate the character(s) controlled by the opponent to win the game. In the basic game, each player starts with one character and on a turn you draw a card from your deck, then play it immediately. The card types are monster  which are played on your own character to boost defenses and heal damage  and attack  which are played on the opponent's character. A character can have defenses in three colors  green, red, blue  and if an attack is stronger than a character's defense in that attack's color, then the attack hits and damages the character.

The cards are transparent and they stack on top of each other during play. A character's health is represented by three damage zones on the card, and if all these zones turn red (by playing one or more attacks on that character), then the character is eliminated. An attack can also cover up and remove a character's defense, while monsters can boost defenses and cover red damage zones with yellow ones, thus healing the character.

In the advance game, each player controls three characters and starts with a hand of three cards and a maximum Kairu value of three. Each turn, a player boosts his maximum Kairu by one (to a maximum of 20), draws one card, then (optionally) plays monster and attack cards, spending Kairu to do so equal to the cost on each card. Some cards have react abilities that allow you to spend Kairu to defend against attacks. At the start of each turn, your Kairu refreshes to its maximum value.

If you eliminate all three of your opponent's characters, you win the game. If you cannot draw a card on your turn because your deck is exhausted, you lose.

The war is fought with modular Vector 3 ships that can carry an assortment of pods: lasers, torpedo launchers, defensive-screen generators, and tractor/pressor beams. Ship movement is Newtonian and three-dimensional: (X,Y) and (X,Z) position charts are used to track where the ships are at any given time.  Players spend ship points to buy ship components and technology points to buy improved technologies; victory points are earned for destroying pods and ships and for being the last player to have ships in play. When all of one player's ships have been destroyed or warped out, the player with the highest victory point total wins.

Four scenarios are suggested with differing allowed technologies and different numbers of starting ship and technology points. The approximate playing time is a guess; it will depend on the chosen scenario.

Quality sets comprise wooden trays inlaid with the special scoring cards (King Hearts, Queen Spades, Jack Clubs, ten diamonds and the greatest scoring seven of diamonds), plus a conventional 52 card pack and betting tokens (poker chips). Cheaper sets are invariably plastic and can be found in most French supermarkets for a few Euros/dollars.  The objective is to dispose of the cards in your hand, playing them in simple numerical sequence from 1 (Ace) to King, picking up bonuses along the way. The suits have no significance other than when playing the five special cards. The person playing the King terminates the sequence and may restart it with a card of their choice. This is where the strategy comes in. Remembering which cards have been played allows you to frustrate your opponents by starting a sequence favoring the cards remaining in your hand. The simplicity of the basic game appeals to younger gamers, whereas the hardened gambler and his/her gaming friends can enjoy the hunt for the 7 of diamonds tray full of Euros. A good way to learn this game is by downloading shareware versions available on the Internet.

8193,Chainmail,1971,5.21739,69,2.5,2,10,360,360,,Fantasy Medieval Miniatures Wargame ,Dice RollingRole PlayingVariable Player Powers,"Chainmail is a medieval miniatures wargame created by Gary Gygax and fellow Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association (LGTSA) member Jeff Perren, a hobby-shop owner with whom Gygax had become friendly. The game was first published in 1971 by Guidon Games. That first edition also included a fantasy supplement, and is one of the oldest sets of rules for fantasy miniature wargaming.

In 1975, TSR acquired the rights to publish Chainmail and the game may have been the basis for the earliest Dungeons & Dragons game and campaigns (Dave Arneson, co-author of the original D game, apparently disputes this). In the original boxed set of DD one is directed to Chainmail for the combat system but it offered an optional combat system involving 20 sided dice -- a system that eventually became the DD standard.

Regardless of who you believe, the Chainmail fantasy supplement contained spells and monsters that reappeared in Dungeons & Dragons and most certainly influenced Gary Gygax and his thinking about Fantasy games in that era.

Guardians can capture warriors and rangers; rangers can capture warriors; the time lord can capture rangers and guardians; but the lowly warriors are the only ones who can capture the time lord and win the game. Captures are made by moving next to rather than on top of enemy pieces. Each piece can move only one space at a time but they can also warp by leaving the board and leaving a 4-D marker behind. The piece can then stay in the warp zone for up to three turns or warp back onto the board up to two spaces away from the 4-D marker.

Each player is dealt three cards, each card is both creature and modifier. each player except the judge plays one card face down as their creature. Once all the creatures are set out, players take turns placing the remaining cards in their hands face down to alter the abilities of your opponents in funny ways.

Then the players are encouraged to try and sway the player judge (of the round) in their favor, the judge has the final decision of which creature wins the round.

The player whose creatures win a number of rounds based on how many players are in the game wins.

A hilarious fun Family/Party card game.

The game play is simple - just match the shape or number on your card with the shape or number on the previous card.  The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner! Like Uno without the special cards!

There are five suits: stars, circles, squares, crosses and triangles. You can change suit by laying the same number as has been laid in the suit you lay down yourself. Also, the card numbered 20 (WHOT Card) can be used to change from a suit to any other suit at any time.  When the first person has finished, the others count up how many penalty points they have on the cards they have left in their hand. (Star cards count double as indicated by the second smaller figure in the small star). More recent decks also give the suits different colours, stars are blue, circles yellow, crosses red, triangles green, and squares purple.

Whot! was invented (but, apparently, not patented) and trademarked by William Henry Storey, of Southend-on-Sea, England in 1935. It was first marketed by the company Storey  Co of Croydon, which he set up in 1930, but was soon acquired by Waddingtons of Leeds, and was popular in Britain in the 1950's and 1960's.

5209,Rondo,1997,4.98611,36,1.6,2,6,45,45,,Card Game Party Game Word Game ,Card DraftingHand ManagementSet Collection,"Rondo is a German card game where players must construct words from drawn cards.

Goal
Earning the most points by constructing words from letter cards.

Game play
The 110 cards are shuffled. Most of them show a single letter and a point value, which is the higher the more rarely that letter is used in the German language. There are also joker cards (can be used as any letter), and delete cards (can cover up letters at the start or end of a word).
Each player gets 7 cards.
The expandable card holder, in which the letter cards are placed to form words, is set to three slots (maximum length is 9).
To determine a start player, each player tries to form a three-letter word from his/her cards. The player whose word has the highest point value puts a three-letter word into the card holder, his/her points are written down and he/she refills his/her hand to 7. Players then take turns building words from their letter cards. Turn length is determined by a sand timer.

Rules for building words:

     A new word is constructed by putting cards over the previous word, or by adding an additional letter.
     The new word must be at least three letters long.
     The new word can be up to one letter longer than the previous word.
     At least one letter from the previous word must be re-used.
     Creating a new word by adding only a delete or joker card is a valid move.




A player can exchange cards from his/her hand for cards from the draw deck at a cost of -2 points per card.
If a player manages to create a new word before the timer runs out, he/she gets the corresponding points. Bonus points are given for using three or more new cards.
A player who couldn't create a new word gets an additional card. At the end of his/her turn, a player always refills his/her hand to 7.

The game ends when the draw deck has been exhausted and 

     a player has no cards left, or
     all players have passed once.




Players add up their points from all rounds. Remaining hand cards count negative points, according to their point value.
The player with the highest total wins the game.

Although the map is big (10 feet / 3.048 m) the game is smaller than other games (Europa for one). There are not as many rules as in ASL. And yet this is the biggest monster game out there for a number of reasons.

The game is detailed to a degree no other game has come close to.  If using the full rules you keep track of every individual plane and pilot in the three year campaign. Each counter on the board representing a ground unit is composed of many units which are kept track of on logs.  Supplies are kept track of and dispersed in a very detailed manner.

From the rulebook we read how to run a game. CNA is a logistically-oriented game, and its play requires not only a lot of attention to logistics, but, if you will, a logistically sound methodology. It is suggested that you have 5 persons per side with the following duties.

Commander-in-Chief: responsible for strategic decisions and to settle intra-team disputes.

Logistics Commander: In charge of all supplies.  Accepts supply requisitions from the others and keeps all informed of supply shortages. Is in charge of supply dumps, Third line trucks and some second line trucks and is in charge of Naval convoys.

Rear Area Commander: Gets the supplies to the front. In charge of security, reserves, prisoners and construction.

Air Commander: In charge of all planes and pilots.  Is responsible for planning air missions and deployment of air bases.

Front-line Commander: Executes all attacks and troop movements in the front line.  Helps with coordinating defensive efforts.

Playing time with 10 players is listed at 1200 hours.

   You are a squirrel running around the forest in a figure-eight track, picking up pine cones to bring back to your hoard (which you can enter once every lap).  The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.
   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.

Bermuda Triangle, the legendary area in the Atlantic Ocean where dozens of ships and planes have disappeared without explanation, is the setting of this exciting game of suspense.

The sinister mystery cloud hovers, weaves and sweeps, swallowing some ships as it passes.

Can you make it 'home' with your cargo, or will your fleet become just one more victim in the Bermuda Triangle?

THE INTRIGUING GAME OF VANISHING SHIPS


In this game, you try to run a successful ship-transport operation in the mysterious Bermuda Triangle.
There is a track that runs round the board from port to port and you roll a die and move one of your your ships to reach a port to deliver the commodity required by that port.  The prices offered by the ports change with each delivery, so you try to arrive when the price is high.  There is a lot of scope for blocking other ships and for bumping them back to their last port.
So where does the Bermuda Triangle bit come in?  There is a mysterious cloud - a plastic construction raised from the board on a central column - which moves about the board and twists around above the ships. There are magnets on the underside of the cloud and on top of the ships, so ships can be picked up and moved or destroyed when the cloud passes over.  Each turn, a player moves a ship and the cloud - usually trying to protect their own ships and attack those of other players.

6 oblong treasure tiles
3 dice
1 label sheet

OBJECT OF THE GAME
To be the first pirate to arrive back at your hideout with the gold pieces-of-eight treasure

SETTING UP THE GAME
Place the assembled galleon on the gameboard. Shuffle the weapons and place one face down on each of the skull-and-crossbones squares in the corners of the board. Put the other four away, out of play, without looking at them. Put one treasure tile into each chest and close the lids. Shuffle the chests and place them on the rectangles marked in the ship's cabins. Shuffle the key tiles and put them face down in a neat pile in the Haunted Cabin. Put Blackbeard in the Haunted Cabin. Each player chooses a pirate and puts him in his hideout - matching color segment in one corner of the board. Decide who will start. Takes turns clockwise.

PLAYING THE GAME
To move throw two dice and move the total of the two. You may go in any direction but you may not double back over the same squares in the middle of a turn. If you throw a double you DO NOT get another turn.

There are four caves on the shore interconnected by secret passages. They allow you to move around the board quickly. Moving from one cave entrance to another counts as one step.

You may move Blackbeard's ghost if you get a 6 on your dice-throw. Use him to help you and hinder other pirates. He may never leave the galleon. He may pass through a pirate in order to reach a square beyond him. He may enter a cabin occupied by a pirate.

You can fire the cannon, you can be made to walk the plank and can be saved from the water by a floating barrel.

A fish counter is placed one of the icebergs and the players take it in turns to move a penguin (the same type of penguin as in Penguin Pile-Up) the number of icebergs (1-5) indicated by the roll of a D6 (the sixth face of the dice shows a picture of a penguin meaning you do not move that turn). Players move the penguin from iceberg to iceberg, one at a time, attempting to place it so that it does not fall off.  If at any stage the penguin/iceberg topples off its stand then it is reset and that player's turn ends immediately.

Every time a circuit of the eight icebergs is completed the player moving the penguin at that time claims the counter and another draw from the stock of 16.  Play continues in a similar manner until all are claimed.

The number of fish (they vary from 1 to 5) on the players' counters are totaled with the winner being the player who has secured the greatest catch.

You would think so, given that the weapons are hidden within your fortress, but ninja are sometimes so sneaky that they forget where they hid things. Start looking, ninja!

In Ninjago: The Board Game, a spin-off of the 2011 line of Ninjago spin-and-attack figures from LEGO, players must work together to claim the weapons and fight back the skeleton guards you'll encounter. On a turn, you spin the die, then take one of the following actions:

 On a two, you move your ninja up to two spaces, searching a guardhouse for a weapon if you stop in a space where a guardhouse is located.
 On a one/guard, move one space, then place a skeleton guard on a space occupied by a ninja.
 On a one/general, move one space, then move the skeleton general one space down the temple steps.
 On a rope/general, attach a rope to your ninja's head (!) and a nearby guardhouse, then swing to any space that you can reach and land there, then move the general down the temple steps one space.

If a skeleton guard is in your space at the start of your turn, spin the spinner. If it lands on your color or the color of any other ninja in that space, you defeat the guard and take a normal turn; otherwise, move the general down one step and lose your turn.

If the general reaches the bottom of the steps, he steal one weapon from you, then climbs to the top of the steps once again to begin another descent. If you have claimed no weapons by the time this happens, you all lose the game.

Once all the weapons are claimed or captured by the general, enter the final battle, taking turns with the spinner to see whether the general captures another weapon, whether the ninja do, or whether nothing happens. Your sensei awaits on the side of the board, ready to aide you once during this final battle to protect the weapons  unless you've already used his power during the game.

As with all the LEGO games, Ninjago: The Board Game includes multiple variants, such as adjusting the power of the sensei, adding a memory component, adding or removing steps in the temple to tweak the general's effect.

A player can also declare to play Chicken cards, which can cause other players' chickens on the road to move back to the starting point if their color matches the card.  The other players can respond by playing Goose and Safe cards, Chicken Out backwards to the road shoulder, or stay their pieces on the road and chance the result of the Chicken card.

The game ends when a player has both his or her chickens reach the finishing point, making him or her the winner.

Mind Maze allows players to test their skills of deduction and investigation, and to get to the bottom of the mystery with as few questions as possible. Players take turns asking questions, and lose a point for every question they ask. Points can be gained by asking specific key questions which also help players to figure out the true version of the story. This encourages players to think carefully about the questions they ask and to work together.

It's a fascinating board game of shortcuts and surprises.  Play on two tracks at the same time.  Your large pawn moves along the outside track.  Wherever it lands determines how far along the inside track your small pawn will move.  The object of the game is to be the first player to reach the Home Circle on the inside track with your small pawn.

There are shortcuts on both tracks that will allow you to leap ahead.  Shortcuts on the outside track are protected by plastic gates that open and close at the whim of their owners.  In order to pass through an opponent's gate, you might have to be extra clever and wheel and deal your way in.

(How little things have changed since...)

Your net worth is kept track of using a slide rule of sorts, dubbed the ladder of success.  The first player to move into the Ritz by buying or winning steps on his ladder wins.  You can buy into up to four opportunities at once; when you land on another player's opportunity, you can attempt to bail him out of it by paying the bail out price and beating him on the dice.

The Chance of a Lifetime circle is entered on doubles or by landing on an entry space; if you enter it, you may roll as often as you wish, hoping to land on the Big Deal space (which gives you 3 ladder steps) or another good space (where you sell your opportunities for varying profit).  Of course, the circle also includes bad spaces, so there is considerable risk...

A few other spaces round out the board, giving you the opportunity to challenge other players (swapping a ladder step) and other things like that.

The game is sort of a cross between Can't Stop and Monopoly.

Cyberpunk: The Collectible Card Game is a game based in the near dark future of the Cyberpunk world. The world of Cyberpunk is a world in which corporations are the elite ruling class, dark soldiers of fortune rule the streets, and everybody has a price. It is a world based very much on authors like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and movies such as Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic (which was based on a Gibson story), and The Matrix.

Combining the elements of these popular worlds, Cyberpunk the CCG is a game where the player sits down to play the special agenda of one of the world's ruling groups (or Sponsors.) The player brings Hackers, Gangers, Rockers, Solos, and many other characters into a cohesive team under their command and then sends them on missions (Black Ops). Once the player has scored 100 ops points by completing missions (each mission is worth a different amount of points) the player wins. However -- in this world of intrigue and backstabbing - style is just as important. A player can also win if they manage to gather 100 points of style. The final way that a player can win is through the special agenda of their sponsor; each of the seven sponsors has a different agenda.

S-Evolution is a unique combination of a classic card game  with tricks, colors and trump  and of a typical Eurogame of resources management and civilization. Each player has a deck of 24 cards, and in each of the six rounds, he draws a hand of four cards from this deck. Each player starts the game in Age 1 and adds the progress card of this age to his deck.

Each round consists of a card phase, lasting 4-5 tricks among all the players, followed by an individual management phase. During the card phase, players try to (1) gather resources (which are on the cards) to pay for the needs of their civilization and to construct buildings, (2) avoid diasters, and (3) collect discoveries. However, the value of a player's cards are affected by which Age he occupies. In Ages 1 and 2, for example, his cards have no color, so they automatically lose to cards of players in Age 3 and above as those folks have discovered the awesome power of hue. What's more, in the primitive Age 1, you can't see the cards before you play them. That's how primitive you are! In Ages 5 and 6, a player can start using trump to beat out those in lower ages.

The advantages in the card phase are balanced by the needs of your population, which is much greater in later ages. In each trick, each player collects one played card based on the value of their card played, and players then use the resources on these cards (food, tools and science) to satisfy the needs of their population, erect buildings (which supply additional resources), gain advantages (which can protect you from disasters or earn you victory points), or advance to the next Age of S-Evolution. Players score points each round depending on how well they meet the needs of their population, suffering penalties if they fail to do so.

At the end of the sixth round, players score points for their sets of discoveries, and the player with the highest score wins!

In the game, players are divided into two camps: Manlike and Werewolf. During the game, players accuse one another through confidential markers, which send others to death through family trial. When the number of surviving players drops to a predetermined threshold, which is based on the number of players, the camp with more survivors wins.

The problem is there aren't enough available in total for more than one company to achieve that goal.  You win by assembling a full staff and making it safely around to a New Fiscal Year (the Go square, in other words).

As you move about the (bilingual, two-sided) board, you'll have opportunities to hire or raid competing companies.  You must decide how much to pay your people --not enough and they'll switch companies, too much and your company will go bankrupt.  Managing your money is an important aspect of the game but it isn't the victory condition.

Amusingly, the early editions had all-female secretaries and all-male higher personnel; later editions kept the illustrations but shuffled them throughout the positions.

From Waddington ad: Ulcers is the big business game that recognizes an important business fact: PEOPLE are among a company's most valuable assets. And people are why executives get ULCERS. Suppose you had to form a company and had to hire a staff of executives, managers,salesmen and secretaries. You probably think it would be easy but it isn't. ULCRES puts you in the owners chair. You form the company, hire the staff and you try to keep them.

The cards show coins, possibly Roman, but this is a very abstract card game with a memory element.

Goal
Players try to collect as many victory points as possible by collecting series of four consecutively numbered cards.

Game play
The 54 coin cards have values from 1 to 19 printed on both sides. The value on one side differs from that of the other side by a maximum of two.
The goal of the game is to collect series of four coins with consecutive values (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or 9-10-11-12). Series of four are exchanged for victory point cards. There are 12 victory point cards with values from 18 to 7. The first player to collect a series gets the 18-point victory card, the next series is worth 17 points and so on, so the sooner you complete series, the better.

On his/her turn, a player has the following choices:

     They can take the top card from the draw deck and use it in their own card display.
     They can give the top card from the draw deck to one of the other players and get a single (i.e. not part of a series) card from that player's display. Before they can add it to their own display, they have to turn the card over, so its value can be up to two points lower or higher than what they originally saw.
     They can take the top card from a completed series for which another player has already scored points. That card has to be turned over and used with its other side up too.




If a player manages to incorporate a card into his/her card display, they get another turn (limit: 3 consecutive turns). There is no limit on how many rows a player can start in his/her display.

The game ends when there are no cards left in the draw deck.
The player with the most victory points wins the game.

If it does not correspond, it stays discarded with the player, if it corresponds, the player noting this claps his hand on the card in the middle.

The goal is to make as much money - 'Dubloons' - as quickly as possible! Players start from Home Port as merchants and set out on a trading voyage. By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!

Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each players pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they dont show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).

Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the Treasure Chest cards which players draw every time they roll a one. They then find out whether they have landed without any wind in the doldrums, - or been blown by a hurricane to a distant port, - or have found buried treasure - or other such twists of fortune!'

In addition to cards numbered 1 through 10 in the red, blue, green, and yellow suits, there are Wild Sting cards (regular wild cards), Double and Triple Wild Sting cards (wild cards that double and triple the score of a run or set), Pass-a-Pile cards (to move a run or set that's in front of you to another player), Take-It-Back cards (to deny Pass-a-Piles), and Super Wild Sting cards (that *can't* be passed and must be eaten at the end of the round).

Tears of the Dragon is a fantasy board game that pits two players against each other in a RACE to find lost wisdom so that they can free the princess from her curse and win great power. Players assume the role of one of two great warlords - Lord Forseti and Lord Gorganun. Forseti has more powerful units; his armies are the greatest in the world, and they fight much better than Lord Gorganun's. However, Lord Gorganun has a magical edge. He controls more powerful wizards than does Lord Forseti, and he can gain allies in the magical fairy people known as the Cadmin and the mighty dragon, Terromax. What Forseti has in military strength, Gorganun makes up for in total available units and magical prowess.

535,Power Barons,1986,5.39829,164,2.0417,3,4,30,30,Family Strategy,Card Game ,,"from the general Comment:
This is essentially a card game. Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray political power suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.

If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.

8429,Combat Command,1971,5.02647,34,2.5,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"Strategy  Tactics magazine #30.

Time Scale: ? day per turn

Map Scale:  .75 km per hex

Unit Scale: Platoon/Company

After SPI sold their groundbreaking Eastern Front wargame, PanzerBlitz, to Avalon Hill, designer James F. Dunnigan turned his eye to the Western Front. Combat Command was described as Platoon-Company Level Combat, France 1944.

From the Design Notes:

PanzerBlitz (published by Avalon Hill) proved to be a very popular game.  It was complex, but most people were enthusiastic about its apparent realism and authenticity.  In point of fact, PanzerBlitz was not all that realistic or authentic.  The game did have its good points.  That it moved at all was a credit to its play-mechanics.  What was lacking was an awareness, and implementation, of some of the more critical aspects of small unit operations.  Chief among these aspects is the confusion factor, which becomes nearly decisive at the platoon level.  Other aspects left untreated in PanzerBlitz were the near simultaneity of action and reaction at that scale, as well as a more realistic handling of combined arms coordination.

Not all of these problems (nor others unmentioned) have been solved in Combat Command.  By merely changing the cale and some of the combat and movement mechanics, we have introduced more change in the game than these innovations themselves suggest.  One rather obvious result is that the game is simpler, easier to play.  This is essential for any game.  Too much time spent on the mechanics makes the simulation more of an exercise than a game.  The game-system for platoon level simulation as it now stands in Combat Command is not yet perfect.  But we do feel it's superior to the system we first introduced in Tactical Game 3 and PanzerBlitz.  We are working on still better game-systems for this scale of operations.  When we finish them, we'll publish them!

The Combat Command game system was quickly discarded as the seventies saw SPI release a string of new and improved tactical wargame systems.

Each player plays with the same core crew cards in the middle of the table. These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.

The game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the Current Player: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the Challenging Player.

The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.

You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.

XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.

The shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy. My favorite card - Shirtless Kirk.

There is also an expansion for this game. See here

There were also 6 additional cards, that were chase cards from the Star Trek Phase 3 trading card set. These were not available in either expansion!

Winning over audiences with your television, radio and newspaper media with quality content is a key element, but it won't directly bring you victory. Lucrative advertising contracts are needed for you to profit from your media operations, but they bore and repel your audiences, requiring you to balance profit and sustainability at all times

Each turn is divided in multiple phases: the business phase, the media phase, the advertising phase, the boredom phase and the mogul phase.

In the business phase, players must select two actions to branch out into new media outlets, break into new continents and secure advertising contracts. They may purchase a media outlet, draw a media card, invest in their outlets or confirm advertising contracts. Once every player has chosen two actions, the process is repeated twice more. In the media phase, players bid for the attention of patrons on different continents and receive awards according to their global and specific media performance on each continent. Bids are made using permanent content bought for each player's office in the first phase (investment) and temporary content from media cards. To maintain an outlet, players must meet minimum content requirements. In the advertising phase, players earn revenue through advertising from patrons they've attracted. In the boredom phase, players lose patrons from their office according to a pre-determined pattern found on the turn order track. In the mogul phase, the turn order marker is advanced, face up cards are changed and the leading mogul marker is passed to the next player.

The game ends once the media deck has run out twice or if the turn marker reaches the end of the turn track. The winner is the player with the greatest media value.

As the leader of a powerful merchant clan, you must carefully plan the trade routes that will bring wealth to your family. Build fleets and caravans to control commerce in key cities and vie for rights of passage to your rivals' islands.

Caravans of Ahldarahd is a boardgame set in a fantastic realm of desert kingdoms. Each player has a unique gameboard with a mix of advantages and disadvantages. As you plan your strategy, you must choose whether to secure monopolies in your own region or throw caution to the wind and deploy your traders to distant ports. Your deals with fellow players will ultimately determine your success or failure.

The resources you need to build your trading empire can only be acquired by the highest bid, so you must balance fast expansion with longterm planning. If you strike too soon, your control may be easy to challenge. But if you wait too long, the game could end before you're able to fulfill your plans.

In addition to resource and route management, players can bid for the favor of the mighty Shah, the zealous Eyes of Shamesh, and the mysterious Pirate Queen to secure special advantages. Meanwhile, each person's map can be invaded by any opponent controlling its Right of Passage card. The position of your allies changes from turn to turn, so those who ignore the political play can find themselves at a disadvantage.

Humorous trivia game based on the public radio quiz show Whad'Ya Know?, hosted by Michael Feldman. Works somewhat like Apples to Apples in that a different person reads a card each round, which the other players respond to. The reader (who puts a Michael Feldman bobblehead in front of them) cannot score that round. The outrageous questions are multiple choice (A,B or C) and are based on general knowledge and opinion polls.

Gameplay
Players to either side of the reader are the 2 contestants; the rest are the audience. Audience members choose and reveal their answers and then try to convince both contestants to vote for their answer. (They'll get points for their persuasive powers, even if it's the wrong answer.) After discussion and debating, the contestants vote for their answers and scoring chips are awarded.

Scoring
Anyone with the right answer to the question gets a chip. If both contestants choose the correct answer, they and everyone else with the right answer get an extra bonus chip. If both contestants choose wrong, they get no chips, but any audience member who chose the same wrong answer as both contestants gets a chip for successfully influencing them. The bobblehead is passed to the left and the new reader asks the next question. Play proceeds until someone wins the required number of chips (10-16, depending on the number of players).

Each turn, a player rolls a die and moves one of his pieces forward on the track exactly that number of spaces; if any pieces rest on top of this chosen piece, whether his or an opponent's, those pieces are moved as well. If the moved piece (or stack of pieces) would land on an occupied space, it covers any pieces located there.

Whenever the first piece of a color is moved over a scoring gate  of which there are four on the track  all towers are scored. If a multi-colored tower is on a raised section of the track, the player who owns the top piece earns as many points as the number of pieces in the stack; if such a tower is on the ground, the owner of the bottom piece scores points instead. Each turn before moving, a player can spend a point to move one of his pieces to the top or bottom of a stack.

The battles at Tarawa and Saipan are depicted on separate game maps and use two separate game systems. Although the Fresno Gaming Association was probably guilty of plagiarism in some of their game designs, their graphic presentation was always first class and this game is no exception.

The Island Battle of Saipan uses the system that FGA previously used in their OPERATION CRUSADER game. This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.

The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls. Each hex on the Tarawa map represents 35 yards from hexside to opposite hexside and a Game Turn represents 2 hours.

In the Ancient World ('Kingdoms and AntiKingdoms Division Age), the Summoners (you) own several decks. The basic one is the Duel Stack that consists mostly of Figures  and Characters which belong to the Eragra Saga as well as several new Card Leagues such as Ploys Ad Hoc (Artefacts n' Constructions), Relics, Walls, Incantations and many other. The next 2 Stacks are the Mastery (10 cards) and the Grim (15 cards) one where you must Unfold, meaning you cannot use them from the beginning of the Duel. The rest of the cards form a Common Space which can be used by all the Summoners! There, a War of Incantations and Artefacts take place and the most powerful combinations with Minions wins

Purpose in the Ancient World is to send as many Rival Minions as you can, to Limbo, in order to collect as many as you can from your Crystals (max. 25). The next step is to enter the Future World which can be done by activating 1 specific card from your Mastery Stack, a Vortex called Cyberspace. You can enter there any time you want but will you have enough Crystals? If you enter the Future World, then the rest Summoners must follow you with the Crystals they have collected from the first phase. Tough balance? No, the game in the Future World is totally different and much faster. In this world all change, so the rules.


     The Future Stack is divided in 4 parts. Each Summoner owns a Stack of 30 cards. The cards you handle here are Viruses, Machines, Weapons, Ambushes, Resources  Future Survivors. Here you use your collected Crystals. 



     Each Future card has the sing of a Crystal along with a number. For example you may have a Hybrid Machine and on it the Crystal sing and the number 3. Since you activate this card, place the equivalent Crystals on it. That means, your rivals have to beat this card thrice. Following this way, this Machine will be destroyed. Each time the rival wins a small battle, you remove a Crystal from your card and gives it to him. This world is faster since the Machines are moving in each round and carry dangerous tools capable of the ultimate destruction.. here the Duel here may last...few minutes!! 



     Final Goal' of the Duel is to remove by any mean the Crystals from your rival(s) or to destroy their Future Survivor (there are 4 Future Survivors (1 for each one of you): A Hacker, a Cybermage, a Rebel and a member of the Torrius Syndicate who are protected by your Machines). 


In this game you will find more and more things to discover while you play. The point is to combine your cards well. You will enjoy it more, if you play with more than 1 rival and then you will face the brutality of Eragra. You can create Alliances with a rival Summoner to defeat another, but at the same time you must defeat your ally too. Your only true ally is your Minions. Are you ready?

KAVOK's intention is to use the Federation ship to to attack the Klingon Empire and instigate a Federation/Klingon war. He also plans to gloriously die in battle along with the remaining crew. KAVOK will create setbacks and obstacles for the players as they attempt to gain access to the bridge and regain control of the ship. The journey to the Klingon Empire takes 60 minutes of real time game-playing (displayed on screen). They play against the clock, and if nobody wins, they all lose.

Play consists of rolling the die, moving around the board (which represents the Enterprise), drawing cards and interacting with the video of KAVOK until they reach the bridge and win, or the time expires and they lose.

Game action gets loud and intense as teams scurry to identify their top five answers, and then again as they trade lists and try to identify the top five answers in their opponents category.

Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.
Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.
The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose.

149611,Greedy Wizards,2013,5.15789,38,1,2,2,20,20,,Card Game ,Trick-taking,"Introducing Greedy Wizards  - a two-player card game in which a red wizard battles a blue wizard for the right to eat a delicious cake.

Winning pieces of cake will take you closer to victory - whilst also making it more difficult to claim the next hand. Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other.

How to play

Each wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more Greedy than Gandalf, their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an absolutely massive chicken or a woman who shouts hurricanes.

Players take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs.

However, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?

Beautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, its a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player. As long as they are greedy.

Players choose their homeland by throwing a dart on it, then they place 3 troops on it. A turn consists of each player throwing 3 darts and then moving a troop for each dart if the move is possible.

Troops can move from country to country through a common border (be it physical country border or square tile border). When a player arrives in a country where nobody has ever come, he earns a new troop which he places in this country.

When a troop arrives in a zone (earth or water) already occupied by an enemy troop, combat erupts. The conflict takes place on the target, the player whose dart is closer to the center is the winner and converts the other troop in one of his.

The games purpose is to conquer your opponents homelands, clearing all their troops present there.  The winner is the last player to have protected his country.

When a player loses his homeland, he becomes the slave of his conqueror and carries on playing with his troops present in other parts of the world but has to obey his master.

This game won a prize at the 2005 International Contest of Boardgames Creators of Boulogne (France), and will be available at ESSEN 2006.

To have the best results in the sticking of the darts on the map, the map has to be hung quite high on the wall. A good height consists in putting the center of the small red and white target at the level of the players' eyes. In that configuration, the trajectory of the darts is optimum and they stick very well.

Its up to you to commission a brave officer of the Royal Navy to pursue that black-hearted cur, catch him, and turn him into shark bait. But hes a rascal, that Pirate King, so youll need to recruit one of the dregs of the Queens dungeons because sometimes it takes a pirate to catch a pirate. Iffn you discover where that swab is hiding, youll need to beat the Pirate King in a duel or acquire enough gold to buy back the ship. Act with haste because youre not alone in this hunt. Whoever saves the Sea Hammer first wins the Queens undying gratitude - and the game!

Here's a description of the game from Timothy Rose, who saw a presentation on the game at GenCon:

The SS pirate game is a track based game (think Talisman more than Monopoly ). Each player controls two characters, a hero and a scoundrel type, and the goal is to retrieve the Queen's flagship from the Pirate King. Of course, each character has different ways to do that, either by derring-do and combat or by more underhanded methods (if you have enough gold, you could even BRIBE the Pirate King to get the ship back!). They showed the box design, pretty standard pirate/cutlass stuff, but nice art.

Zombies!!! The Card Game simulates the coming zombie apocalypse in card game form. Each player uses her own deck to form the narrative of her attempted escape; the ground-breaking card design allows for each card to be used for the card effect printed on the front or as a location as indicated by the card's back. The first player to make her way to the helipad at the bottom of her deck escapes certain death and wins the game.

The zombies are right behind you. Do you have what it takes to survive?

1534,Jump!,1998,5.21795,78,1.8,2,5,45,45,,Aviation / Flight ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. 
The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.

Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.

The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.

When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.

Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!

Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.

6187,Avalon,2003,5.4685,173,1.8,2,2,45,45,,Card Game Exploration Fantasy ,Hand Management,"Avalon is a card-based game where a line of 11 landscape cards form the board and the cards in your hand are made up of Knights and Enchantresses. There are 8 of each in each of five different colors, for a total of 80 cards, which both players share as a common draw deck.

The game starts with the landscapes face down, randomly assigned knights or enchantresses on each player's side of the landscape cards, and five knights/enchantresses in each players hand. In the course of the game, if you play knights on your side of the territory and you have at least as many cards on your side before playing the card, you have the option of declaring an attack with that knight. The other player has a chance to respond by defending with a knight of exactly the same color (in which case both knights are left in place). If the attacker is successful, the loser loses all of their cards from their side, and the winner loses an equal number. Then, the winner must lose an additional number of cards from their side or the hand equal to the total number of knights on both sides that were involved in the conflict. Finally, the region is turned face up with the crowns on the bottom facing toward the controlling player. You can only attack up to two landscapes per turn, but you may play as many cards as you would like to on your turn. The max hand size at the end of a round is 5. The object is to control 15 crowns at the end of your turn (number of crowns on a card ranges from 1-3).

Two landscape cards have special abilities - Avalon reduces your loss from battles by one once per turn, and the forest with a standing stone allows you to declare an attack on your opponent with an enchantress as if she was a knight.

Enchantresses normally will convert enemy knights from their side of the board to yours unless countered with a same color enchantress. The countering player receives the aggressor's attacking enchantress into his hand if he counters an enchantress.

When the player is done playing cards, he draws one of the 5 Light tiles or 4 Dark tiles that describe the options for replenishing cards in hand. Light tiles give you their benefit immediately, and Dark tiles give you their benefit at the beginning of your next turn. Each tile is used only once until all tiles have been used, at which point they are all available again. After drawing a replenishment tile, the player's turn is over and the game continues with the next player.

Avalon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.

Every correct answer adds money to the bank. Eight consecutive correct answers raises the bank to the maximum $125,000. An incorrect answer reduces the bank to zero.

Before the question is asked a player may say, Bank! to insure the bank's current level will be carried over to the next round.

The round is complete when the timer has run out. The players then vote to eliminate one of them from the game. The next round continues with the remaining players and less time on the clock.

When only two players remain which ever player gets the most correct responses after each is asked five questions is the winner.

A faithful reproduction of the television series, the game includes a mask of the host, Ann Robinson.

1501,Masterpiece,1970,5.52466,1237,1.4638,3,6,60,60,Family,Bluffing Negotiation ,Auction/Bidding,"Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renoir --- paintings by the world's most famous artists are on the auction block, for sale to the highest bidder. How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?

The MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.

The high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.

Each player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.

The painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack.  Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack.  These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000.  Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value.  When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.

The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.  Players add the values of their paintings to their cash on hand.  The player with the largest total wins.

At the start of each round, each player has seven cards in hand, with the cards valued 1-13. The first player plays any card, then calls Higher or Lower; the next player must play an appropriate card or pass, laying down her cards and stepping out of the round. Instead of playing higher or lower, however, a player can play a card of the same value, saying Double up, which forces all subsequent players to also play a card of the same value.

Two escape valves exist in the game: A player can always play a 7  the large joker  no matter what was played previously, with this player calling out Higher or Lower as normal. A player can play a 1  the small joker  no matter whether Higher or Lower was called, but a 1 can't be played on doubled cards; the 1 can itself be doubled, with only a 7 being able to break the doubling.

As soon as all but one player have passed for the round, the round ends and the lone player still in the round receives one point for each played card. A round might also end by players running out of cards in hand, but the final card played in a round that ends this way cannot be a joker (unless a joker was also the next-to-last card). Once a round ends, players have the option to ditch their hand, after which everyone refills their hand to seven cards and a new round begins.

The first player to have at least sixty points wins!

Each player receives an engine. The active player rolls a die (numbered 3,4,5,5,6,6) and moves the corresponding number of fields forward in a straight line. The engine may be turned by 90 degrees at the end of the move. If s/he doesn't want to use up all the die's points, s/he can decide to go slower. For that, s/he gets the difference in coal coins, but must distribute them in any way among the other players (who may beg, bribe or threaten the active player). Passing another engine costs one coal, passing an engine going in the opposite direction (with more than four players, the starting positions are on both ends of the track) costs 2 coals, and getting rid of an obstacle piece and placing it anywhere else on the track costs 4 coals. 
For crossing the finish lines, the players may pay any number of coals and add that number to their final die roll; they can also do one turn within their turn - but only if they can actually cross the line. The first player to do so, wins. In case of a tie, the remaining coal is the tiebreaker.

If you get a No, you may ask no more questions, but may try to guess the identity of all the players.  A nice mechanism for showing if the player is right is part of the game.  When a player makes his guesses a box is handed around and each player puts a chip in the Yes side if his identity was correctly guessed or a chip in the No side if it was not.

Everything indicates an imitation rather than a license of Parker Brothers.

There are but 3 stations which in addition are not situated in the middle of the sides. On the other hand there are also 3 public works, viz. besides the Electric- and Gas Works there is Telephone as well. There are 3 tax spaces. Really Hungarian is the reward of 500 P you get from each player on your name day (Nvnap).

In the center-area is only 1 space for cards being the 24 orange Chance-cards you have to pull arriving on a Wheel of Fortune space. Instead of Just visiting in Jail you are going to relax at the Margit Isle (in the middle of the river Donau). You are not sent to this place in the 3rd corner because there you'll join in a lottery. There you have to throw immediately once more. You'll receive 10-fold in Pengs from the bank the number of pips thrown. Should you throw 12 you even get the first prize of 10,000 Pengs.

Valiantly they made their way down to depths of the Earth and readied themselves to defeat the dragon, hoping to earn glory and riches  but the mighty creature was waiting, breathing a blast of heat and fire upon them, leaving only their boots!

No one will remember the tale of these unlucky heroes except the hapless group of awestruck hirelings now standing in Rovert's lair, frozen with fear. Feeling helpless as the dragon moves closer and curls his tail behind them, the survivors tremble. The snorting dragon crawls right up in front of them, but instead of breathing fire, it opens his mouth menacingly, as if to draw another breath  or maybe to eat them! At that moment, the bravest of the group yells, Run!

In an instant, the terrified hirelings scramble away, seeking the quickest way out of the dragon's lair. Unfortunately, that's not the way the heroes brought them in, but a new escape route fraught with danger! Their only hope of survival is to use their quick feet and the items strapped to their backs. Unfortunately, they are not too bright (and not very fast) and they have no clue how anything they're carrying might help them. Will they make it out? Only you can determine their fate...

Hirelings: The Ascent is a board game for 2 to 6 players who become the frantic escapees, trying to find and fight their way back above ground. As a hapless hireling, will you be able to make it out? Can you win the game by being the first one out of danger?

The game proceeds in two phases. 
In the first phase the object is to trade and acquire wealth as quickly as possible. To that purpose, each player sails from harbour to harbour: in a harbour a commodity can be bought [wheat  - gold - wood - cloth - wool - fruit]  in some harbours no goods can be bought.
Sailing can be short distance  form harbour to harbour which are connected by dotted lines or long distance using a Long Course card.
Selling goods can take place in any harbour  player rolls the dice which determines which good can be sold  always at three times the cost.
Using a Storm card a player can organise a storm in one of the six areas forcing the ships in that area to leave behind their goods in the harbour  available for the next ship that visits the harbour.
The ships will return again using the dice as this determines to which area the ship will return  player can choose the harbour.
When 2 ships are going to the same harbour the 2 captains need to fight each other using Squabble cards damaging the opponent more and more [pretty funny descriptions]. The loser of the fight looses his money.
However, cards played do NOT return so theres limited supply. And you will definitely need some of these later in the game.

The second phase starts as soon as a player is rich enough to acquire the corsair ship  the corsair ship is auctioned with a minimum cost. The player will then try to eliminate all of his or her adversaries. The dice decides in which area the Corsair ship starts. On the turn of the player owning the Corsair ship he can sail 3 steps  as opposed to the other players who can only sail to the next harbour. The Long Course cards are very valuable now.
When the Corsair ship catches a players ship thats the end of it: goods return to the bank and the owner of the Corsair gets the money. The Corsair ship has done its job and returns to the bank  available for another player to buy it.
The Corsair ship is sensitive to the Storm cards and will sink.

The winner is the one remaining player.

The rules are simple, but the characters are limited in what he/she can do each turn. Also all eliminated players have to wait until theres a winner and are no longer participating in the game.

1714,Moonstar,1981,5.11658,73,2,2,12,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Dice ,Auction/BiddingBetting/WageringDice Rolling,"First was published Corona (1974). Moonstar added planets and variants (variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). Orbit is new game from 1993. Harun is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his Rasenden Robotern (Ricochet Robots) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.

Quite possibly the first German game to cross the Atlantic...

About the game (from the back of the box)

Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.

Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.

The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.

The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.

The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.

But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.

Includes:

    16 x 16 gameboard
    15 moon pieces
    21 planet pieces
    1 minute sand timer
    11 6-sided dice

Then each player tries, with help of the spade, to dig out as many cards with plus points as possible. Those plus points are worth money.

As soon as you stumble upon a minus card, you have to give the spade to the next player, lose all the money you collected so far this turn AND pay the minus penalty. You may also stop anytime before.

It is a word dice game where players make words to score points. Scoring is determined by squaring the number of letters in the words spelled (e.g. making a 3 letter word and a 4 letter word would net 25 (9+16)) and subtracting the square of unused letters.

The 2003 Endless Games edition includes 22 letter cubes and is scored differently, assigning a point value to each letter based upon the length of the word it is part of, with crossed words scoring the shared letter twice, possibly with two different values.

Players try to collect a set of four cards. Each set of four cards corresponds to one of the 'dates' hidden behind the door (apart from the infamous 'dud').

Gameplay is determined by the instructions on the square a particular player lands on.  Cards may be taken from the draw or discard pile, or from other players.  When a player holds a correct set of four cards and lands on an 'open door' square the door is opened, revealing the date.

If the cards do not correspond to the date, the player's turn ends but their set of cards are retained.  If the 'dud' date is revealed, all cards held by the player are lost and replaced with a fresh set from the draw pile.

If the correct date appears when the door is opened the game is over and the player opening the door wins the game.

This game was first released in a white box in 1965 and had a 'groovy' upgrade in the early seventies with new artwork.

Once you win an auction of the items that match each of your Curio cards you win the game. Item cards represent the items you can find for sale on the eBay website. During the game Item Cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder. There are 2 types of Bidding Cards: Money Cards and Action Cards.

First the Curio Cards are dealt according to the number of players ... 3 or 4 players = 5 Curio Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 4 Curio Cards each. Second the Item Cards are dealt face up in a row ... 3 or 4 players = 4 Item Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 5 Item Cards each. Third, each player is dealt 5 Bidding Cards. One D6 die is then placed on each Item Card matching the number showing on the die to the Number of Rounds field on the item. Finally, each player rolls a die. The highest roll receives the Starter Card and goes first.

One complete round of play consists of one turn per player and an Auction Update Phase. During each player's turn, they may perform any or all of the following actions in any order: 1) Draw hand back up to 5 Bidding Cards, 2) Discard one Item Card won on a previous turn to draw 3 Bidding Cards, 3) Either 3a) Play 1 Action Card and/or place 1 bid on an item, 3b) In lieu of placing a bid and/or playing an Action Card, you may discard as many Bidding Cards as you like. You redraw at the beginning of your next turn.

When each player has taken a turn, The Starter Card passes to the left.  After this, starting with the first Item Card, the die on each Item Card is lowered by one. When a die reaches zero, the auction is finished and all bids are revealed. Players may, at this point, play Action Cards which are allowed during this phase.

Action cards: Know Your Enemy, Bad Money Order, Tastes Change, Mass Amnesia, Offshore Financing, Lost Connection

Cards played during Auction Update Phase: Expensive Shipping, Reserve Price, Bad Feedback

You can change the length of the game by adding or subtracting the number of Curio Cards available.

(Most of the above was taken directly out of the rules sheet that comes with the game. Personal note: Some of the Item Card titles and flavor text is pretty funny and some are just plain cute.)

7713,Dingo,1985,4.98929,42,1,3,7,10,10,Children's,Card Game Children's Game ,Set CollectionTrading,"From Amigo: The aim of the game is to be the first player to collect a set of 5 identical cards and shout Dingo.

Each player begins with a set of 5 identical animal cards and 3 chips. All players keep the cards in their hands and pass one card to the player on their right until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand.

Each player takes one card from his hand and places it face down on the table in front of the player to his right. As soon as all players have put down a card, each player picks up the card passed to him from the player on his left (a command e.g. now may also be given for this). This procedure is repeated until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand. When this happens, the player in question puts his hand down on the table and calls Dingo. As soon as the other players hear the word Dingo, they must put their hands on top of the calling players hand as quickly as possible. The last player to put his hand down must give one of his chips to the winner (the hand at the bottom).

The game continues until the conditions agreed at the beginning of the game are fulfilled, or the player with the highest number of chips is the overall winner.

This is a Game of Travel, concluding with a Pirate fight.  It comprises a Game-Board, Travel-Cards, Four Travelers, and Spinner.  The Game-Board is a Map of the World.  The Travel-Cards indicate journeys to be made by the Travelers, and the distance to be traveled in each move is determined by spinning.  As the routes of travel are well-known railroad and steamship lines, the players acquire a knowledge of these, also the chief cities and ports and their principal articles of commerce...

The game was first published by Milton Bradley in 1911.  Other known dates of publication include 1936, 1953, 1956, 1960 and (finally?) 1970.  The game was also published in Great Britain by Chad Valley in the 1960's.  Details of the world map, travel cards, etc. vary between editions.

2738,The Gnumies,2001,5.36513,195,1.2,2,5,20,20,,Card Game Fantasy ,Auction/BiddingHand ManagementSet CollectionSimultaneous Action Selection,"OVERVIEW:

The Gnumies  their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies  their friends are shown on the Gnumies card,  the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10,  one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!

GAME PLAY:

1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. 
2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. 
3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. 
4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. 
5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. 
6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.

7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!

8) The is also a WILD CARD in this game. It is called the COPICASTOR. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).

9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.

10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind  4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!

10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!

7715,Porca Miseria,1999,4.99756,41,1,3,8,30,30,Children's,Action / Dexterity Card Game Children's Game ,Hand ManagementSimultaneous Action Selection,"From Amigo: Be the fastest one to get the right lucky charm! But which lucky charm is the right one: mushroom, pig or chimney sweep? Your personal lucky number will tell you. You need luck and talent to gather the most cards of all players.

START OF PLAY
Three target cards are placed in the middle of the table. Each player must be able to reach them well with both his hands. The remaining 63 cards (symbol and touch cards) are shuffled and this deck is placed face down on the table. One player is chosen to be the starting player.

The Lucky Number
Now each player receives one or more lucky numbers. The starting player places the face down deck in front of him on the table. He reveals the topmost card in such a way that everyone can see it at the same time. The revealed card is either a symbol or a touch card.

A symbol card shows one to eight small lucky mushrooms (blue), lucky pigs (yellow) and chimney sweeps (red) in different combinations and in the color of the target cards. When a symbol card is revealed, each player has to find out, how often a symbol is found on the symbol card. If the number of one symbol equals the lucky number of a player he tries to draw the appropriate target card as quickly as possible towards him.

For each target card a player has successfully drawn he receives a card from the deck. These cards are placed in front of the player. If a player draws (touching counts as drawing) a card, which he was not allowed to draw (e.g. because he miscounted the symbols) he has to put three of his own cards in the jackpot, for each card he has drawn wrongly. If he has less than three cards, all of them have to go into the jackpot.

The jackpot is a collection of cards (maximum five). It is placed near the target cards. If there are at any time more than five cards in the jackpot, the surplus cards are shuffled back into the deck before revealing the topmost card. At the start of play there is no jackpot.

After the first player has given a card from the deck to each player who has correctly drawn a target card, the target cards are placed back in the middle of the table. The revealed card is placed in the jackpot as are all the cards the players have lost.

If a touch card is revealed, quick reactions are called for. Each player tries to touch the matching target card with both his hands, placing one after the other. This will create a huge pile of hands, sometimes in wildly mixed order. The target card remains in the middle of the table. A touch card shows a big lucky mushroom, a big lucky pig or a big chimney sweep.

Whoever is the first to have only one hand of another player between his two hands (e.g. there are not two or more hands between his two hands (the sandwich)) receives the revealed touch card and the jackpot.

After the starting player has given the touch card and the jackpot to the winner, this round is finished.

If there are not enough cards in the deck to give to all players the cards they won, The game ends immediately. The player with the most cards wins the game.

130227,Big Badaboom,2012,5.37344,64,1.75,3,5,45,45,,Card Game Fantasy Humor ,,"Game description from the publisher:

The humorous card game Big Badaboom features a lot of explosive action, high player interaction, a non-sequential order of play, some nifty new mechanisms and some proven old ones, numerous chances to stick it to your opponents in nasty ways, and stunning graphics.

The players of Big Badaboom take on the roles of wretched goblins in penal servitude to the cruel High Necromancer. Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and through reverse-engineering examine various explosive contraptions manufactured by the necromancer's enemies. But the task to gain hands-on knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out and the only way to do that is to survive long enough to earn the gold coins needed to bribe their way out of their miserable situation.

To win players need to keep their heads, perfect their timing, make every card count and, above all, make sure not to be the one holding the bomb when it explodes.

Compared to the original game, Big Badaboom has five more bombs, five more mechanisms, and a new category of cards: the resurrection cards. These optional cards add even more slapstick humor to the game. The resurrection cards are placed in a separate pile, and whenever a goblin is caught in an explosion and resurrected, the player draws one card. On it the player will find an annoying, but hilarious, side effect that the goblin has gained for the next round as a result of the explosion. Finally, Big Badaboom comes in a stunning anarchist bomb-style case.

Lovecraft story of the same name  that is, they don't know whether or not rats truly scamper behind the walls of their residence.

In the game, one player is the Giver and starts the round with the dice cup and a single die, which shows one rat on one face, two rats on another face, and no rats on the remaining four faces. The Giver places the die in the cup, shakes the cup, places it face down, then peeks inside. He then claims to hear no rats behind the walls or some number of rats. If he says no rats and the next player  the Receiver  believes him, the Receiver becomes the new Giver, adds a die to the cup, and the game continues; if the Receiver doesn't believe him, then he lifts the cup. If no rats are present, the Receiver loses one brain scoring token to the Giver; clearly he's touched in the head if he's hearing rats where none exist. If rats are present, however, then the Giver loses two brains, giving one of them to the Receiver. The Caller's an even worse case!

If the Giver claims that rats are present, he must pay one brain, then the Receiver taking the cup can call him (with penalties going one way or the other) or he can believe the Giver, handing over one brain to the Giver as the sanity cost of accepting such nonsense. The Receiver can then either pass the cup along to the next person or he can add a die to the cup, shake all the dice, and make another claim about the number of mice in the walls, with this number being at least one larger than the previous number. In this case, the Receiver becomes the Giver, and the round continues as before.

Once one player has lost all of his brains, the game ends, and the player with the most brains wins.

Players start in the middle of a maze.  Every turn a player picks a tile and connects it with the tiles already on the table and then moves his/her pawn if desired or possible.  Players attempt to keep their paths open and to block or trap their opponents with strategic placement of the wall tiles.  After the fourth exterior corner tile has been placed, tiles may be replaced as well as placed, and the exit tile is shuffled into the draw pile.  The first player to the exit tile when it appears scores zero points.  Every other player gets points depending on how far their pawn is when the exit is reached by anyone.  The fewest points after a number of rounds is the winner.

The goal of the game is to be the last one with one or more balloons intact.

There is no reading required for the game, and because there is no strategy to gameplay, a preschooler has just as much chance of winning as an adult.

From the publisher:
It's never nice to lose something you like.  But every parent knows how important it is for kids to learn to cope with such situations.
In this game, each child has five balloons, one or the other of which will burst or get lost every now and then.  But don't worry: some cards have dear Mom on them, who can usually help.

As in the original Monopoly game, players start with cash in hand, roll dice, and move a token around the game board while hoping to purchase properties. Each property is represented by one or more billboards, with the more valuable properties having larger billboards. When you purchase a property, you place a billboard into your personal plastic tower; when you pass Go! on the game board, you earn income based on the height of your tower. Reach a value of $800 on your tower, and you win.

When you land on an opponent's property, you pay rent to that player based on the height of her tower. If you don't have enough cash on hand, hand over the top billboard in your tower instead but keep the cash you do have. This mechanism means there is no player elimination.

While players don't trade properties, you can effectively steal them through the use of Empire cards and the swap face on one die, which allows you to swap the top billboards on two towers.

To date, two editions have been released in the U.S.: The Second Silver Edition has some updated properties  movers from the First Gold Edition, but gameplay is the same for both editions.

The house cat jumps off the old table, sending dust clouds everywhere.  As the cat leaps into your lap, your nose starts to itch!  Your friend laughs at you mischievously.

The object of Sneeze is to match Sneeze cards to your opponents allergies and make them sneeze.

If you sneeze too much, youre out!

Players each start with one Sneeze card as an Allergy.  On your turn you place a sneeze card into either the upwind pool (which will make people sneeze immediately) or the downwind pool (which is safe until the wind changes).

If all of your allergy cards are matched by cards in the upwind pool then you sneeze, that pool clears, you draw another allergy card and both you and the player who made you sneeze draw an 'And Now' (event) card.  These can be played on your turn instead of flipping an allergy card to effect the course of the game (e.g. you hold your breath to avoid sneezing, or play a 'mean trick' to double the effect of one of the cards than an opponent is allergic to).

When a player with four allergies sneezes they are out--at that point the game switches to 'sudden death' with any player who sneezes being eliminated.

This is clearly a kids game, but with a few twists of strategy to keep everybody interested, especially around management of 'And Now' cards, and preparing for the switch into the sudden death end game.

Coinciding with the final book in the trilogy being released this fall, the Training Days game allows 2-6 players to follow in the footsteps of their favorite Tributes.

User review: Each player chooses a district to represent and a gender. The players take the appropriate Tribute Card. Each Tribute Card gives the players ratings from one (low) to eight (high) in four attributes: strength, ability, cunning, and charm. The Challenge deck is shuffled and a player is chosen to go first. The players will take their turns in clockwise order.

The first player reveals a number of Challenge cards equal to the number of players. Each player has three effort tokens: one (low), three (medium), and six (high). Each player, in turn, will assign one effort token face down to any Challenge card. After all the players have assigned their effort tokens, the events on the Challenge cards are resolved. One Challenge card at a time, the effort tokens are revealed and the winner of the event is determined. Each player total ones own Effort tokens plus the Attribute rating called for by the card, plus alliance bonuses (from Tribute cards not already in play) plus a die roll. The player with the highest total wins the event and the approval rating associated with the event.

Three End of Day cards were shuffled into the Event deck at the beginning of the game. When ever an End of Day card is revealed, then all the event cards are shuffled with the End of Days cards. Before the game began the players determine how many days the will last. When that number of End of Day cards has been revealed, then the game is over and the player who has the highest approval rating is the winner.

29010,Walk the Plank,2007,5.17222,63,1.4,3,9,5,5,,Card Game Pirates ,Trick-taking,"Walk the Plank is a fast-moving card game for three to nine players, ages eight and up. The object is to win the most battles in any given round to become Captain for the next round. But be careful  if you dont win ANY battles in a round, youre out of the game. Youre dealt fewer cards in each successive round, and the player who wins the final round wins the game! Play is fast and furious, with an average game time of only 10 minutes.

Walk the Plank comes with a deck of 68 cards. The deck has sixty-five numbered cards, two Walk the Plank! cards, and one Sea Monster! card. The sixty-five numbered cards are divided into five suits: Doubloons, Hookhands, Monkeys, Parrots, and Peglegs. The cards in each suit are numbered 1 through 13, with 1 worth the least and 13 worth the most.

The first dealer, or Captain, deals 7 cards to each player in the first round of seven. Subsequent rounds deal one less card. (Round 2 is 6 cards, Round 3 is 5 cards, etc.) The Captain then turns over the top card on the deck so that everyone may see it. The suit of the card revealed will be trump for the first round. The trump suit is the most powerful suit in any given battle. For example, if Monkeys are trump, then a low card in Monkeys will beat even a higher-numbered card in any other suit. If the card the Captain turns over is a Walk the Plank! or a Sea Monster!, there is no trump suit for this first round. In every round after the first, whoever is Captain chooses the trump suit after looking at his or her cards.

The suit of the first card played in a battle is called the current suit. If this card is a numbered card, it may or may not be from the trump suit. If the first card played in a battle is one of the three special cards, there is no current suit for that battle, but each player still has to play one card.

You must play a card of the same suit as the first card played in each battle, if you can. We call this following suit. So if you have any cards in your hand of the same suit as the first one played in a battle, you have to pick one and play it. You dont have to follow suit if you have no cards in the current suit. You dont have to follow suit if you have a special card (Walk the Plank! or Sea Monster!), unless you choose not to play the special card.

Walk the Plank! will win any battle, beating even the highest card in the trump suitthink of it as a wild card worth one more than the highest card in play. When someone plays Sea Monster!, no one wins the battle, no matter what cards
have been played. The player who played Sea Monster! doesn't win the battle, but he/she does gain control. (So he/she gets to choose the current suit for the next battle by playing the first card.)

The player who wins the battle in the round becomes the Captain in the next round, which means you get to play the first card in the next battle.

If you win one or more battles in a round in which no other player wins a battle, you win the game!

16620,Domination,2005,5.10588,68,1.2,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area EnclosureTile Placement,"From the publisher's press release (the game is scheduled to be introduced at The American International Toy Fair in New York City, February 17-23, 2005, and should be in stores by June 2005.

Youve never played Dominoes like this before ... its strategic, challenging and suspenseful, while at the same time, classic in its simplicity. Play dominoes on their corresponding spaces on the game board. As you complete squares, you conquer territories and claim them as your own. Dominate the game board and you win! For ages 8 and up.

From a review in Games Quarterly, Winter 2005:

The Domination board is a seven-by-seven grid of squares with sets of numbers that resemble half a domino at each corner. Each player starts with seven dominoes. When it's your turn, you lay down a domino along one edge of a square so that the numbers on both corners match your domino. Then you draw another domino.

If your play closes off the fourth side of a square, you put a poker chip in the center of that square to claim it. You keep playing until all the dominoes are used, which fills up the entire board. At that point, the player with the most chips on the board wins the game.

Game 1: You're the lead horse of a herd that has escaped the ranchers and gone wild. Collect 9 mares/foals and be the first to Green River Valley.

Game2: You're a rancher out to round up horses that have broken free. Make it to Green River valley with a one of each type of horse (eight types)

Game 3: Same as game 2, but the goal is to arrive at Green River Valley with three pairs of horses that each have attributes in common (same color, etc.)

All three are simple games and follow the basic: Roll dice, move piece, read card type, with a little variation. The map has some interesting choices - different routes converge at some areas forcing players to choose which way to go, since landing on another player's token allows you to steal a horse.

Perhaps the best part of the game is the artwork and background. The horse cards are beautifully drawn and the descriptions on the back of each include detail on the color, markings, and some interesting horse facts. Best for the kids of horse enthusiasts, or kids who are horse enthusiasts.

Those that reach the goal on the game board first will yield the most points for the players. At the same time, however the players must achieve individual goals by cleverly playing their cards. The one that does this best, will get the most points. And that leads to conflict quickly!

The board is placed in the middle of the table with 3 coloured markes placed on it. On their turn, a player lays a card: he can lay it in front of himself to try to improve his chances, or in front of another player to make the completion of their tasks more difficult for them. You may even play cards face down to cover a face up card (your own or an opponents). With each card played, the same coloured marker is moved. That means that all markers can be moved by all players. The finishing order of the 3 markers determines the sequence for the 3 tasks. Now the points are calculated for each player, and after 4 rounds the winner is the player with the most points.

In events like the high jump and pole vault, the more attempts made the greater chance of fatigue.  Injuries and fatigue affect the results of later events.

605,Banana Republic,1993,5.30667,150,1.4615,2,5,30,30,,Bluffing Card Game ,Hand Management,"Extrapolated from the Doris & Frank site.

Very tactical bluff game that requires a good memory and features a great showdown at the end of every game.

Essentially the game is very easy, the players use money to bribe voters. They can also use killers, bodyguards and journalists to affect the vote.

All actions are done by placing cards face down!

Though you can have a peek at some of those cards every turn, you're forced to act with incomplete information till the end.

The game is meant to be played with from 2 to 5 players. 
It probably works best with 4 players, but it also plays pretty well as a 2-player game though it feels differently played that way.  Half an hour playing time.

But it's not quite that simple as not all of the components have the right form  and players can try to use their construction workers on the lower floors to block out others.

Players have 5 workers, and are dealt a hand of building tiles. The tiles, in combination with rivets which fit through holes in the center, create a 3-dimensional construction. The tiles have grids in various configurations, and some have a construction worker. On your turn, take 3 actions. Options include placing a worker, moving a worker up a level, or building = adding a tile to the construction (which must touch the tile on which one of that player's workers is standing); score points = 1 per girder touching a girder already built, +1 if worker on tile, doubled if the new tile is now the highest built. There are penalties if you drop tiles or worker tokens, but otherwise you generally alternate taking turns adding tiles to the building.

The rivets are placed in an hole in the center of the tile and can be fitted to other tiles already in play. There are some (few) construction rules and the building will grow turn after turn. Where add tiles is an important decision but you also need a certain amount of precision and dexterity doing that because if you cause the fall of a worker (yours of opponent) you will loose points. Actually an important part of the game is placing your workers in a way that make much more difficult to opponents to add tiles.

The game ends prematurely if someone collapses the building; they lose, and whoever is furthest on the score track (after deducting points for tiles remaining in hand) wins the game. Otherwise, most points (after all tiles built) wins!

14812,Camelot,2005,5.23982,113,1.6667,3,6,20,20,Wargames,Real-time ,Simultaneous Action Selection,"In Camelot, players vie for control of Excalibur. Each player controls five Arthurs and a host of other Arthurian characters in a heated attempt to grab and retrieve the sword before any other player succeeds in this task.

On the surface, the game appears to be a very simple wargame, combat being quickly resolved without any dice as characters fight each other. The key to the game, however, is that two players are always taking turns at the same time, the turns being regulated by turn tokens that pass around the board. When one player finishes his or her turn, the turn-token is passed to the next player who does not already have one. If one player is a slowpoke taking his turn, then the other turn-token passes around the table, allowing other players to take turns. This forces players to take very fast turns, usually about 5 seconds each, allowing the game to move along with the intensity of a video game. Games usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, even with three to six players.

Special rules resolve potential conflicts that could occur when two players try to perform actions simultaneously where priority is in question, resolving quickly and simply.

No player ever quite gets knocked out of the game due to loss of characters; Arthurs always rejuvenate, returning to your pile of pieces (your village) that can enter the board. Characters start at a chosen entry space at the edge of the board, and move to the center to grab Excalibur, returning the Sword to their entry space to win. Each of the 5 character-types (Merlin, Lancelot, etc) have their own unique abilities, but everyone starts with an identical set of pieces.

There are also two variants in the rules, allowing players to vary the game by going after the Accoutrements of Kingship instead of the Sword, or by gathering a number of gold pieces scattered around the board so as to buy the kingship. Tokens are included for these variants.

The game is very intense and fast, requiring players to think on their feet and make fast realtime decisions; if you are a big fan of slow, deep thinking, strategy games, you might look elsewhere.

At the start of each round, each player receives a hand of six cards, then four more cards are placed face-up on the table; the deck includes cards in four colors, numbered 1-10 twice, along with two Cowtown cards of each color. Cowtown cards are always played on the table immediately in order to give the little dogies a place to settle.

On a turn, you play a card from your hand onto a stack on the table. The card you play must be one higher than the top card on a stack. (Cowtown cards are effectively numbered 0.) If you can play multiple cards in numerical order  a Horn-to-Tail Sequence  you can do so; in addition (or alternatively) you can play multiple cards with the same number  a Stampede  onto different stacks when those stacks have the same lower number. Playing a three-card Horn-to-Tail Sequence or a Stampede is worth 1 scorecow.

Whenever you play a card of matching color onto a stack, you're safe, but if you play at least one card of a different color  a bullish play  then you must draw and discard the top card of the deck. If that card shows a red bull's eye, then you've been kicked and must draw a card. Lay a 10 on a stack and you close that barn, getting to take another turn or pass one of your cards to another player.

The round ends as soon as one player is out of cards or the deck runs out. The player with the fewest cards earns 4 scorecows, the player with the next fewest 2 scorecows, and everyone other than the player with the most cards earns 1 scorecow. After four rounds, whoever holds the most scorecows wins!

Players take turns revealing event, resource and bandit cards from the deck. After the events are resolved, the players bid for the resources. Then the active player uses his action points and resources to acquire building permits, acquire tools or erect buildings which differ in their resource costs and advantages conferred. Bandits may also be used to further the player's goal, but may backfire if the dice are not friendly. Then players engage in a subgame somewhat akin to Blackjack -- but with a greater range of results -- to distribute gold useful for the next auction. What's tricky is to take in more gold diggers than anyone else, but not to take so many that the ensuing brawl wipes out all of the profits. The eventual winner is the player who has managed to construct the best set of buildings with bonuses for achieving multiple buildings of the same type. This player is elected Mayor of Goldrush City.

Created by the designer of Strand-Cup.

Prepare to find yourself on the other side of the barricade Waves on waves of Goblins try to conquer the city of the humans, through debatable strategies, inconsistent plains and brainless Epic Death.

Goblins is a not collectible card game that melds the bases of the board game with those of the card game.

Raze the town to the ground and loot everything you can find on your way to leading a mob of stupid Goblins! Other Goblin commanders will collaborate on this task as well. Unfortunately, the idea of collaboration among Goblins is a little bit ambiguous. Dealing with useless subordinates and treacherous allies, the enemy will be the last of your problems.

Players must destroy the Town and conquer as many Land Cards as possible. Land Cards will award the owner Victory Points. The player with the highest amount of Victory Points wins the match.

To reach their objective players can rely on Goblin commanders, the alter ego of each player on the battleground; each of these has unique and particular ability to make every game different from the other.

Unlikely Machines, fearless Goblin heroes and a lot of Action Card make the game always unpredictable.

The innovative game system is based on  Goblins flipping. Every choice you make will cause Goblin flip to determine its life or its death. Every Goblin is represented by a disk with two faces: every disk shows a Goblin face on a side and a Goblin skull on the other side.

The game is exciting every moment also when it isnt your turn. No player will ever be too strong or too weak and the game strategy will change turn after turn suiting better possible the situation.

Through the system of the exhilarating Epic Deaths , your Goblins can commit mass suicide in eccentric ways. The Epic Death can confuse every enemy and allows you to beat him for the dismay. No player is ever out of the game.

Let the fight for stupidity begin!

60311,Pairs in Pears,2009,5.19069,102,1.1667,2,4,20,30,,Word Game ,Tile Placement,"Pairs in Pears is a word game consisting of plastic letter tiles inside a cloth bag shaped like a pear. It is from the Bananagrams (letter tiles in a banana) company.

The Pairs in Pears game involves making pairs of intersecting words that consist of tiles of all the same pattern. One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).

The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).

The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.

Each player has an army consisting of Sorcerers, human infantry, and magical units (trolls, demons, and dragons). Sorcerers specialize in types of magic represented by 7 different colors. Sorcerer adds a twist to the old combat differential system (attack strength minus defense strength) by adding a circular system of combat bonuses based upon what colors of magic are attacking each other; Blue/Green/Yellow/Grey/Orange/Red/Purple with each color having a strong advantage over it's neighbor to the right (with Purple circling around to have power over Blue) and a disadvantage against it's neighbor to the left, with lessening combat bonuses the further away the color is from itself. Combat bonuses are also given based on map position as the hexes alternate colors of magic instead of representing physical terrain. Attacking from one's own color is good.

Several different scenarios are included in the rulebook that range from 1 to 6 players.

The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady  The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.

When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.

An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game. Nice to look at though.

Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.  After everyone has revealed their card, whoever has the most points wins.

Already then, it was a fine art for the early Mafiosos to launder their ill-gotten gains. Just like today, this was done through 'legitimate' businesses like laundries, restaurants or antique shops. As players of this canny card game, we must take our dirty money and invest it in money-making small enterprises. To do this, we have the use of a powerful Familia.

Unfortunately, other clans have something against us being able to successfully found our enterprises. So, in this game, a legitimate business only comes into being after a hefty clan war. The player who manages to make the most 'clean' money is crowned the head mafioso. But if someone should manage to open one of each of the different business types, he is crowned prince of the island without a fight.

A roll and move race game where you must get your 4 pawns numbered 1 through 4 into the corresponding number spaces on the other side of the board. Each player tries to manoeuvre his four coloured pieces to their ending positions before the others.  On your turn, you roll two dice and assign each die to a separate piece; doubles get you an extra go.  You can only move sideways and forward.  If you get landed on by your opponent your pawn gets sent back to the start. Spaces of your own color are safe, where you cannot be landed upon. First player to get all 4 of their pawns across the board wins.

The end game zone channels all pieces through a narrow passage, increasing the likelihood of mayhem.

A basic chits, hexes and odds-ratio CRT based wargame.  To represent the two dimensions, there are two hexes with the same number on each side of the mapboard -- representing the position in each dimension, with pop-over possibly happening, either voluntarily or involuntarily.

From the box:

They came from another universe, ruthless aliens too horrible for humans to look upon.  They came to kill and to breed more of their murderous kind.  Demons, they were called, hellish denizens of a hellish dimension.

Dimension Demons pits invading Demons against the defending Freefeet militia of Ishom.  The game features a dual map system to represent dimensions.  Victory goes to the player who can control Trans-Dimensional Projection and breeding of new Demons.  You must defeat the nefarious minions of the evil dimension or try to subjugate the human infestation of Ishom.  The universe depends on it!

Tongue in cheek version of the classic Monopoly.  Player tokens are altered - now you can choose from a jeep, teddy bear, blow drier, leather cap, handcuffs or a stiletto heel.  Properties have been changed to a 'gay' theme as well - e.g. Fire Island and Castro Street.  Instead of buying houses and hotels, you can buy bars and bathhouses.  The money denominations include $3.00 bills.

One departure from the original Monopoly is the inclusion of Family Pride cards.  When landing on the appropriate space, the description of a famous gay man is read aloud, and the player who can correctly identify the person can move ahead to any space on the board.  Also different is the addition of Camp Cards.  When these are drawn, you must perform the indicated action (ie. 'say: 'faaabulous!' six different ways and receive $3).  Finally, there are hanky code cards, where the player must identify what each color of the code meant, and what it meant when worn in each (left and right) rear pants pocket.

Rumor has it that there were only a very limited number of copies of this game, as it was produced by The Parker Sisters, a division of Fire Island games, and were sued for copyright infringement by Parker Brothers (the company is no longer in business).

92776,Guards! Guards! A Discworld Boardgame,2011,5.5891,335,2.6286,2,6,120,120,Thematic,Fantasy Novel-based ,Area Control / Area InfluenceArea MovementDice RollingSecret Unit DeploymentSimultaneous Action Selection,"Guards! Guards! A Discworld Boardgame sees players taking on the role of newly recruited members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. With the Eight Great Spells missing from the Unseen University, the future of the Disc hangs in the balance. Each player is tasked with collecting and returning a number of the spells to the university before it is too late. Each player selects one of four Guilds to infiltrate: Thieves, Assassins, Alchemists or Fools. Their chosen Guild Card will give them a specific selection of the Great Spells to collect and grants them a unique Guild Ability which can be used to hinder their opponents. It is also used to mark the players Charm, Guild and Magic abilities, which can be developed throughout the game.

There are twelve locations on the board where players may charm (or bribe) volunteers to join them on their quest.
The characters are split into three Volunteer Decks each representing the range of inhabitants who might be found in different locations within the city: Lords  Ladies, Man  Beast and Shades  Shadows. Each Volunteer is assigned a set of skill attributes which can be used individually to protect the Spells, or combined with those of other volunteers and used to complete the Wizards Challenges - five tests of strength, brain, and worthiness which the runners must complete in order to enter the Unseen University with the Spells. A selection of enchanted scrolls, weapons, armour and magical items can be purchased by players to equip their volunteers and boost their attributes.

A number of volunteer cards carry the Mark of the Brethren, the name of a secret society which aims to summon a greater dragon to the city in a plan to overthrow the powers that be in Ankh-Morpork. If a player holds three of these cards at any time, he may choose to call a dragon to a specific city quadrant. This effectively shuts down that area of the city until the dragon is driven off. (Handy if spells are located there that your opponents need.) Opposing players may choose to face the dragon individually or to co-operate with other players and send a combined squad of volunteers to see off the beast. (Dragons may also be called to the city automatically during the game on the turn of a fate card. If this happens, all players must send at least one volunteer to face it.) Members of the Brethren may also be secretly planted in city quadrants to operate as saboteurs.

When a player feels has recruited the right volunteers, he moves to collect and return the first required Spell (as marked on his Guild Card). You can send up to four volunteers on a Spell Run. Opponents may use magic, or Saboteurs if they have one in play, to try to stop a spell run. If all (or any) of your runners make it to the Unseen University, they must attempt one of the Wizards Challenges (resolved by totalling a specific attribute score of the successful runners, with any bonuses gained from items or magic and a dice roll). If successful they have returned the Spell. The volunteers used are seen to have fulfilled their duty and are discarded. The player then goes on toward his next spell (recruiting new volunteers along the way). The winner is the first to return the five Great Spells shown on his Guild Card. Being set in Ankh-Morpork, many other random hazards face players, but we don't want to spoil the surprise and tell you everything! Where's the fun in that?

391,Ocean,1999,4.75556,45,1,2,6,20,20,,Animals Card Game ,,"The idea is for players to populate the various oceans with large schools of fish, and then strategically place their animals so they can eat the greatest value of fish.

The mechanics of the game are simple. There are five oceans which are set out in a column. The rest of the cards are divided into two decks: fish and animals. Fish cards carry values from 0 - 3 points each.

A player fills his hand with five cards, of which at least one must be an animal card. All animal cards in a player's possession are placed face-up in front of him. Animals are color coded to specific oceans and may only be played on that ocean. Fish may be played on any ocean.

Players then alternate playing cards to the oceans. Fish cards are played to the right side of an ocean, while animal cards are played to the left of their respective 'home' ocean. Each 'side' may only contain a maximum of five cards.

The idea is to time the placement of your animal cards so as to score the most points based on the value of the fish already played to that ocean. So, if three fish cards had been played to the Atlantic Ocean, worth 1, 2 ad 0 points respectively (for a total of 3 points), the first player to play an animal card on that ocean (it must be THE animal which can be played on that ocean) will score 3 points. The second player to plan an animal card to that ocean scores double the points (6 points). The third player to place an animal on that ocean scores triple the points (9 points); etc.

Barbarians invade the crumbling Roman Empire. Once they reach Rome or when the last coin has been taken from the board the game ends. Whoever held on to the most provinces on the board wins the game.

To start, every player places his pieces on provinces on the map, every province gets a coin as well. Possible actions per round are determined by throwing 3 dice per player, then placing a chit of this player in the corresponding box. Once every player has rolled and placed his chits the actions are taken, starting with the 1 box up to the 6 box. For every chit in the box one appropriate action is taken by that player.

1, 3 and 5 is a barbarian attack, 2 and 4 allows a player to attack, 6 is taxation.
Attacks are resolved by throwing 3 dice, any double causes one hit and eliminates the defending piece, a triple allows for a barbarian breakthrough and eliminates another piece adjacent to the original defender. Taxation allows for a maximum of three coins taken from the board.

4460,Green Ghost,1965,5.074,40,1,2,4,30,30,Children's,Children's Game Horror ,Roll / Spin and MoveSet Collection,"Marketed as the first glow-in-the-dark game, there were at least three versions of the board. One was green with red spaces, another white with red spaces and the third was white with brown spaces. The glowing does not work as well as showed on the television commercials, which, if you watched carefully, were filmed using black light. (If you wish to play the game, you may like to use a black light yourself.)

Past the appearance, the game itself is pretty much the usual roll-and-move with a few twists. The board is up on stilts and the path has holes in it so that movers may fall through and thereby gain the privilege of opening one of the three pits (cardboard boxes containing ghoulish feeling items) and retrieving one of the precious small green ghosts. Players are not ensuring victory, but simply improving their chances in the end game which is decided by the giant green ghost spinner.

Instruction's intro:
You are a young commando. This is your first stand-alone test. Found you on an unknown island. Your task is to find three important parts of the helicopter, with which you could fly away. Promotion is only for the first one. Forests, mountains, swamps, dangerous rivers, winds, strange accidents, lack of money and exhaustion are some of the adversities that you have to beat to win.

- Take one action card (reloading) of either ammo (to shoot), life (to protect) or energy (to move, open tile or rotate tile) cards.
- Playing 1 or more action cards of the same sort (ammo, life or energy).

There is one tile of each card symbol, where you may reload 2 cards of the type. You can never have more than 7 cards.

The players scores point by getting 1 point for each discovery tile and 2 or 3 point for either paintings or evidence, depending of which team they belong.

With 4 players, you play in teams. With 2 or 3 players you play individually with Lara on the 'good side' and 1 or 2 'bad guys' as opponents. If equal, then the winner is the one who gets the last point.

9802,Tuchulcha,2004,5.1979,147,1.7647,2,4,30,30,,Dice Mythology ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and MoveVariable Player Powers,"Theme:

Game is themed around a purification ritual of the ancient Etruscan people, who predated the Roman Empire around 6th century B.C.  Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On Tagete's day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.

Goal:

Each player has 8 pawns representing Haruspexes [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity Tuchulcha with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to Lasa Vecuvia with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set passages on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.

Players win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.

Gameplay:

Game plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the spiritual strength of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or passage spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the spiritual strength of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate Tuchulcha player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 neutral colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.

At any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must sacrifice 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.

If a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to seal the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.

32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors

Alexander, the Great King, will visit the Oracle! Apollo, God of Clairvoyance, help us! Why is this bad? Well, as high priest of the oracle, it is your craft to tell the future. No issues there. But it will be hard to tell only that part of the future that the King wants to hear. Because if the prediction displeases His Majesty, your own future may not look too bright...

In Oraklos, players predict the future by throwing many-colored dice onto the table. By gazing at the resulting pattern, they simultaneously try to find elements of the prediction Alexander wants to hear. The fastest sweet talking soothsayer wins the game.

Apart from the standard game, Oraklos contains 2 variants. Oraklos Junior, an easy variant, is suited for children from 6 years onwards and children will often beat the adults! Antipodes is a more difficult game, suitable for players from 10 years onwards. All variants take about 15 minutes.

The playing material consists of 70 wish cards, 54 dice, 3 audience tokens, a measuring cord and rules in English, Dutch and German.

Contents of the game: 112 cards, 4 dice, 4 scheme markers (white) and 2 card-cancelling markers (orange).

Each card represents a players motion in attack (red) and in defence (blue), except for the goalkeeper, who only has a catch motion plus special cards. 
Each coach chooses the scheme to be used and draws 11 cards for that specific scheme (Ex. 4-4-2).
The ball handler plays a card and at the same time his opponent also plays a card. If the ball handler is playing with a defender, the opponent should contrast it with a forward card, likewise, if a midfielder is playing, the opponent should also play with a midfielder. 
The ball handler should always pass the ball to a player in a more forward, adjacent section. Only one back-pass is allowed during each action.
If the player still has the ball after playing an attack card, he may attempt to score a goal. Roll as many dice as the value of the bonuses accumulated during the action, minus the value for the goalkeeper.
Some special cards may be used to have an extra benefit in some cases.

Rules are in Italian, English and German languages.

2635,Finance and Fortune,1932,4.8037,54,1.1667,2,6,120,120,,Economic ,Roll / Spin and Move,"In 1932, Finance was published through L. S. Ayres  Co. The name was changed to Finance for trademark reasons, the first publication of a game which had become a household phenomenon.

Lizzie Magie first copyrighted the game in 1903, in slightly different form, under the name The Landlord's Game, and this game was made by hand in small quantities and was distributed mostly by individuals.  At this time, the name Monopoly was first used to describe the game.

Though slight differences appeared in regional play of the game, the game was remarkably similar to the modern incarnation of Monopoly.  Parker Brothers wanted to promote the Charles Darrow version of the game, even though they knew that it was not Mr. Darrow's creation.

Layman had already published Finance.  The game had been around for years.  According to a Time Magazine article dated February 17th, 1936:

I wrote the entire rulebook for the game of Finance in 1931 (copyrighted 1932) and simplified the old game of Monopoly for manufacturing purposes... --Dan Layman

Almost exactly this same game as played at Williams was put on the market in Indianapolis early in 1932 through L. S. Ayres  Co. The name was changed to Finance for trademark reasons... 

This was the only article published which contradicted what would become Parker Brothers' assertion that it had published the original Monopoly, and that Layman's version was a spin-off.  
 Layman had forced the retraction by Time in 1936, when an article two weeks earlier had published an article titled Monopoly and Politics.  What was unknown to Time was that Layman had sold the game to a small games manufacturer, David W. Knapp, the originator of the popular 1930s game Krazy-Ikes.

Knapp was eventually bought out by Parker Brothers for $10,000--a significant sum at the time.  But it was a far cry from the Millions in Royalties that were paid to Charles Darrow.

Parker Brothers eventually published the game Finance, after simplifying the rules for easier play and marketing it as a separate entity.

Alpha is a word game for 2 players. there are 98 cards with letters on them and 10 blitz cards showing a lightning bolts. These are shuffled together and six are laid out between the players. Each player gets 3 cards in their start hand. On your turn you try to make the longest word possible with the six letters showing on the table using each letter as many times as you want. For example you could make the word letters with the letters L, E, T, R, and S showing. Each turn you must cover one letter with a card from your hand and then draw another card. You may do this before or after you make a word. If you cover a letter with a blitz card that pile is permanently out so as the game progresses there are less letters to use. You receive 1 point for making a word. 1 point for every letter in the word more then the number of letter piles. You also get 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z you use. The game ends when there are only 2 letter piles left.

Blitz is a word game for 3-6 players. Each player has a hand of 3 cards. 2 cards are placed face down in front of each player. All cards are turned up at the same time. The first player to call out a word that can be formed with the letters showing gets 1 point plus 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z they used. The second player to call out a word gets 2 points but the word must be longer then the previous word. This continues until all players have called out a word or passed due to not seeing a legal word. Each round is started by covering a letter from your hand. The game ends when one player has both letter piles covered with a blitz card.

Alpha Blitz was awarded the title Best Word Game by Games Magazine in 1999.

- all railway spaces show the front of a Canadian train rather than the black Parker locomotive
- The 10 metal playing pieces include 9 original to 'classic' version, and a new beaver token (of course!).

For the 2000 2nd edition, all the pewter playing tokens were replaced with 8 true Canadian versions, including: Moose, Ski Plane, Bear, Hockey Player, Winter Boot, Sled, Canoe and Train. Other changes:
- The banknotes design is different: In the centre is a maple leave and to it's left and right is a space showing the name of the sponsor Royal Bank.
-Community chest and chance are replaced with bilingual 'Provincial' cards (red) and 'Federal' cards (yellow), both showing the same skyline picture as the box lid. They all show funny drawings with Mr. Monopoly (as Rich Uncle Pennybags will be called from 2000 onwards). 
The text on some of these cards have been adapted to uniquely Canadian situations.

For the 2010 'Electronic Banking' edition of the game, an online contest was conducted in which participants were asked to vote for cities to be on the new board. Unlike the earlier editions, properties were arranged in their final vote order, and are not in any specific geographic arrangement.

- Otherwise, put your topping anywhere on the pizza, including on top of other food, without spilling ANY toppings.

Components:  A 4x4 board, 2 sets of 4 pieces, and 2 players.

Beginning:  An X is formed with each player's piece aligned diagonally from the corners.

The game consists of only one simple rule and three ways to win. Pieces move in a straight line, including diagonally, as far as possible with no jumps. The three ways to win are arranging your pieces in a straight line on the board (not diagonally), occupying the four corners, or forming a 2x2 square anywhere on the board.  However, the antisocial strategy of trapping an opponent's piece in a corner loses!!

116821,Skip-Bo Dice Game,2011,4.5,32,1,2,4,5,5,,Dice Number ,Dice Rolling,"BASIC DESCRIPTION:
The Skip-Bo Dice Game attempts to translate the original Skip-Bo card game into a two- to four-player dice game. It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.

COMPONENTS:
The game includes 12 dice, three in each of four colors, and 17 mission cards. Each three-die set of set of dice includes a normal six-sided die, a six-sided die with the 2 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo, and a six-sided die with the 4 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo. The 17 mission cards include three-number sequences (i.e., 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6, 1-3-5, 2-4-6) or descriptions of three-number sets (i.e., all dice same, all dice even, all dice odd).

GAMEPLAY:
Each player takes a three-dice set and one of the mission cards is revealed. All players roll their dice attempting to roll the sequence or set shown on the revealed mission card. Rolled dice that match a portion of the mission card can be saved aside when the remaining dice are rerolled. A player may use one Skip-Bo wild logo to represent a needed die on the mission card. When a player's rolled dice match the sequence or set shown on the mission card, he or she calls out, Skip-Bo! and collects the mission card. Another mission card is revealed and play continues until one player has collected five mission cards, winning the game.

PACKAGING:
This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label. The top of the can pops off (twist to open). The one sheet of rules, 12 dice, and deck of 17 mission cards fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin. The tin also has a coin slot in the top that serves no purpose for the Skip-Bo Dice Game.

This game is about the friendly unveiling of such secrets. The players try to reveal the dark sides of the other players and to hide their own secrets well. There are points for revealing secrets, for which the players move forward on the success track. In the end, whoever stands farthest up on the success track wins, but only if his dark side was not revealed.

The cards in the players' hands represent the secrets. The players can brag about them in order to get points, but they must be careful that their own secrets are not revealed by the other players, because then the other players will earn points.

33583,Folko-Boks,2007,4.38333,30,1,2,2,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Fighting Sports ,,"Folko-Boks is a boxing-themed abstract pure strategy game.  The game lasts 10 rounds in a ring of 36 squares, randomly initialized with numbered chits. In each round, players move their boxers like a chess knight, removing the numbered marker from the square they left.  The boxer who moves onto a higher numbered square wins that round.  Being unable to move causes a knockout loss.

Folko-Boks was included as a free game in issue 4 of the Polish board gaming magazine Świat Gier Planszowych (World of Boardgames) published December 2007.

The game acknowledges some inspiration from an earlier game by Sid Sackson, probably Paper Boxing.
There is a somewhat similar game Joust on an 8x8 grid.

12453,Atmosfear: The DVD Board Game,2003,5.52483,582,1.629,3,6,60,60,Party,Horror ,Roll / Spin and Move,"An update to the VCR games Nightmare from 1991 and it's 1995 successor, Atmosfear.

The aim of Atmosfear is to collect a key from each of the six regions of the board before heading to the Well of Fears in the center and attempting to draw your fear from among those of your opponents in order to win the game. This must be done before 49 minutes pass, or all players lose automatically.
Atmosfear uses a DVD that acts as a timer, constantly ticking away toward the end of the game. The Gatekeeper also frequently appears on screen and causes problems for any or all of the players. Just like its predecessor, Atmosfear makes for stressful play -- players rush to take their turn and pass on the dice as quickly as possible before the Gatekeeper appears and calls on them. 
Unlike the original, the adaption to DVD means encounters with the Gatekeeper are randomized rather than in a fixed order, so you cannot predict when he will turn up next. It also means that new events can come up several plays on, although as with the original, in the long run, players may still become familiar with the possible events, leading to reduced replayability.

In Dice Devils each player takes on the role of one of six devils, each ranked from 1 to 6 and each with a different special ability. On a turn, players roll their dice in secret, then one by one they each choose one of the hot items on offer on the table, starting with devil #1. When players have chosen the same item, then their dice and special abilities come into play to see who gets the goods. Fewer items are available each round than the number of players, so conflict must take place!

Each player starts with a deck containing the same cards; each card shows a value from 1-5, sometimes as a numeral, sometimes with fingers on a hand, sometimes spelled in various languages, and so on.

Everyone plays at the same time. Players take three cards in hand, then all try to play cards to the center of the table, starting with 1s, then 2s, etc. The number of card piles in play can't exceed the number of players. When playing a card, a player can lay down a card that's one higher or one lower than the top card on a pile. As soon as a player lays down a 5, she claims the pile, placing it in her score pile. Players can discard cards as they like, but they lose 1 point for each card discarded.

As soon as a player runs out of cards, she can end the round. Everyone scores 1 point for each card in their individual score pile, then loses 1 point for each card discarded, each card in hand, and each card still in their pile. Players then sort the cards and start a new round. When one player has totaled 100 or more points, she wins!

The knobs don't have the same indentations for either player, so you're never sure if you're helping the opponent or not.

146275,Vikings: Warriors of the North,2013,5.37599,223,1.6667,3,4,60,60,,Adventure Fantasy Fighting Medieval Nautical ,Dice RollingGrid MovementHand ManagementPick-up and Deliver,"In Vikings: Warriors of the North, players take the roles of Viking jarls, fighting for control over the North and the Konung Crown. The first one to pillage all of the villages and take the daughters of their thanes to his home port as warranty of recognition of jarls authority will be declared the winner. To do this, the jarls will have to brave the stormy northern seas, battling each other along the way, and watch out for the sea monster that lurks beneath the waves! The most cunning and vehement of them all  that is, the one who the Gods favor  will throw a great feast and become the Konung of the North.

Vikings: Warriors of the North is a card-based game. Players draw cards from a common deck. Wind cards are used for moving a drakkar around the board that depicts the cold north sea. Players can move the drakkar to a village (to sack it), to an enemy drakkar (to attack it), or to their own ports, where they can throw a feast for the Gods.

A player can also use cards to drastically change the gameplay: He can increase his chances in an attack, re-roll the dice, sail further with his drakkar, or steal cards from an enemy's hand. All of those cards represent story events that have tangible effects within the game. Some cards represent heroes who can become part of a drakkar's crew. As long as a hero stays on the ship, he grants his owner a permanent effect. Each drakkar has three open slots for heroes. Daughters of the thanes are also considered heroes, so they also occupy drakkar slots. With only three slots, players have to think hard about their crew composition.

On a turn, a player can play any number of cards from his hand and take one action: attack, sack a village, throw a feast, etc. Attacks are resolved by a roll of a six-sided (d6) die, although many cards influence the combat result, so each battle is exciting.

When a player take three daughters of the thanes (each of a different, opposing player color) and brings them to his own port, the game is over and that player wins. The gameplay is fast, furious and fun, full of twists and comebacks; it really lets you feel like a Viking chieftain!

This game is basically a take-that style card game where players take turns targeting each other with various damage inflicting snowball cards and rolling a die to see if you hit.  Targets can defend by playing various cards that affect the die roll and sometimes allow a counter-attack.  Much more friendly for young children than similar games such as (e.g.) Lunch Money.  Most clever aspect of the design is the round snowball-shaped cards.

1. A minimum number of playing pieces, preferably one each. 
The smallest possible board.

2. A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.

3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.

4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play forever.

The L game was the result. Each player has only one piece. The board is four squares by four squares.

In this standalone expansion, players have the choice of 6 new factions that use a combination of the 6 existing and 6 all new abilities. Each of the factions plays very different from another.

Three enemy cards always lie on the table in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth Card Game. Each enemy card shows a combination of one (e.g. Orc patrol) to four (e.g. Balrog) symbols, with six different symbols total in the game: sword, axe, spear, bow, fist, and shield. In order to beat the enemies, the players collect groups of companion cards (which also show symbols) in front of them. Once the symbols of a group match one or more enemy cards, the player can send this group to battle to win enemy cards. The group is then discarded.

On his turn a player can either:


    Play one companion card to one of his groups and, if possible, attack.
    Start a new group and, if possible, attack.
    Draft one card to his hand. If he drafts a Mordor card, it is placed on the table and he drafts another card. When the third Mordor card hits the table, the players suffer a counterattack and all lose a card from their hand, a card from one of their groups, or an already vanquished enemy, depending on the text of the Mordor card.


When no enemies remain, the game ends. Each enemy card is worth 1-10 victory points, and the player with the most points wins.

3849,Red Zone,1995,4.54412,34,1.5,2,2,60,60,Customizable,Card Game Collectible Components Sports ,,"A collectible card game (CCG) where players take the part of an owner/coach of a professional (United States) football team and play a football game vs each other.

It uses a built play deck reminiscent of other CCG games, and that same play deck is used as both a timer and an indicator of results for the games called offensive and defensive plays.

The opponents match decks versus each other, as well as a lineup of face-up starters on each side of the ball.

Each coach calls a play simultaneously, and results of the combination of the plays and the performance of the individual player(s) involved are checked also.

The Play wheel chart makes this quite efficient.  Base gamers, who do not have this wheel are left to consult a chart which cross-references the results.  The Play wheel streamlines the game--and decreases the down time significantly.

The game is played in quarters like in regular football, timed by the use of a time-deck.  Coaches can implement double-teams, and run trick plays versus the other.

The offensive plays available in the expansion set was significant to opening up the play books for each coach, including never-before-seen plays on both sides of the ball.  Additionally, certain players were hybrid players.

The most notable of these was the Kordell Stewart card which we used to call slash like his on the field nickname:  Because he is a QB/WR/RB, and has stats which are superlative for all three positions.  This makes him a valuable asset to any team.

Special Rare and Ultra-Rare cards allowed special abilities or results to be played from the hand of either coach, assisting in particular offensive and defensive plays.  Some cards also result in penalties, fumbles, interceptions, and big plays.

The Players purchase ships, load them with products and sail the three continents selling and trading their products, building bases, evading pirates and defying storms.

The winner of the game is decided by victory cards. Victory cards can be acquired via purchasing and maintaining bases, and by hunting down pirates. Different combinations of victory cards are worth different numbers of victory points.

Victory cards are drawn from the top of a shuffled deck, randomizing the type of a card the players get. The player who first acquires victory cards worth ten victory points wins the game.

Players attempt to be the first to spot one of two types of matches: Two different colored cards with the same value on different players' piles OR two different colored cards of the same value on one player's pile. The first player to spot it slaps the pile and shouts Go Bananas! That player then takes the pile(s).

Additionally, players must watch out for matching Gotcha Gator cards (same number as card previously played in one player's pile) and rotten banana/fresh banana matches as well - each having its own shout as well.

The first player to collect all the cards in the deck is the winner.

One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.

Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.

The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.

The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.

Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.

Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.

End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.

This is a game about a travel around the world (it is not similar to Around the World in 80 Days). The map is the world with a lot of cities shown. The cities correspond to cards. Each player receives cards, in the basic game a card from each continent. The first card given is the starting city of the player, the other are the cities he must visit on his journey but in order of his liking.
The game is then dice throwing to travel your route as fast as possible. There are different forms of transportation on the map and you can only use one form at a throw.

The game has also a set of card representing cables which can be used for variation. These are presented to the player who throws a six for the third time and he then has to do immediately whatever the cable says.

2253,Touring,1906,5.24412,165,1.25,2,6,30,30,,Card Game Racing Sports ,Set CollectionTake That,"Touring is a card game which has the theme of an automobile trip. The object is to be the first player to complete a particular set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest the required card counts are 8, 4, 2 AND 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to loose mileage cards, or to play problem cards for which you must fix by playing a corresponding remedy card.

The game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.

Touring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since replaced it.

As driving technology improved, mileage and card names became outdated, thus replaced with longer distaances.  There are multiple sets of rules reflecting these changes.  The final edition added some card categories.

The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the protective cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.

The basic turn consists of the following actions: applying minuses that your foe rolled in the previous turn, rolling your dice that are still in play, setting aside minuses to apply against your foes next turn, select your defenses against your foes attacks, array your own attacks against your opponent, recovering from stuns and wounds, and finally, suffering stuns and wounds from your opponents attacks.

The advanced game adds breed abilities, counting coup (winning player selects a wounded die to keep as a trophy), and multi-player rules.

Chaos Progenitus is expanded by Plague Beasts.
Every Plague Beasts Booster Pack contains eight more six-sided dice to build your fiends. Six are randomly selected from the three new breed colors, and the other two from the five breeds already presented in the Starter Set.

Each booster has 3 Fester fiend dice, 2 Rot fiend dice, 1 Stench fiend die, and 2 random dice from the starter races.

Each player starts with six letter tiles; the first to accumulate 19 or more is the winner.  Each player tries to form the longest possible word from the OTHER player's tiles, starting with the last tile drawn.  The first to find a word starts a marble rolling down a zigzag groove, and the other player must give a word before the marble reaches the bottom.  Then each player takes the tiles of the word they formed from the other player, each draws a new starting tile, and they take the next turn.  There is also a variant which uses the point values on the tiles (same as in Scrabble) for scoring.

In this fun take on alien invasion games, you get to choose whether you want to fight off alien forces as the army or whether you want be the aliens trying to conquer Earth.

In the game, players roll dice to set their power  each army has one type of dice with six faces  so that they can destroy the other players' dice on a subsequent turn. Used dice are placed into an expended pile where they can later be rallied (re-rolled) to reset their power. Dice are ranked in power and can destroy any die of equal or lesser rank but the higher value dice have special abilities, e.g., Nukes on the Army side that destroy just about everything if you get three of them. On a player's turn, he has three options: (1) Attack with an existing die, (2) Rally any or all dice (including active ones) or (3) Use a special power.

If five rounds pass without either player scoring, then the game ends and the player who has the most dice in his scoring zone wins.

The game is set in a science-fiction setting of the same name, novelized in a 4-book series by Margaret Weis.  For the game, players buy (collect) cards to build up their decks, which are shuffled and from which cards are drawn into hands and played.

Players take on the roles of Warlords and to deploy their navies, they play system cards, which bestow Influence points.  Other cards can then be played if their cost in Influence are met.  Personality cards provide special abilities and personality points, which are required to play certain cards.  Fate, Damage, Artifacts and Tactics cards are played to alter the outcomes of battles fought among the deployed naval ships (Battleships, Carriers, Destroyers, etc) and squadrons of fighters and bombers.

Star of the Guardians uses a lane-based combat system (Lane-To-Lane).  Each player's fleet is deployed in five columns (lanes).  The frontline ships bear the brunt of the fight while the ships behind them can give support, depending on their positions and cards played.  When a player's fleet has been destroyed, his or her home system is open to attack.  Any damage done to a player's home system reduces his or her power, and when a player's power has been reduced to zero, he or she loses the game.

The game includes 36 special dice, a timer, and a 184 page rules and examples manual.

The games included in this set are actually a set of logic rules presented in a 'Programmed Instruction' order.  Each game adds to all prior games until Game 21, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, is attained.

As well as building WFFs (Well Formed Formulas), players must also try to reach a goal by using rules of inference.

For example: If the goal is 'p', a player could use the 'Ko' (or Conjunction Out) rule and use 'Kpq' as a premise.  In other terms, if the following sentence is true: The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy and the last games of WFF 'n PROOF are hard.  Then it can be inferred that the following sentence is true: The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy.

Up to 36 dice are rolled depending on the game being played.  One player sets a 'goal' by building a WFF in the goal area of the playing mat.  players then alternate playing dice to the permitted or essential sections of the play area.  If a die is placed in the essential area it MUST be used in either a premise or a rule.  If a player doesn't think that it can be used, he can challenge his opponent.

To win, a player must make a successful challenge or be unsuccessfully challenged.

Games 3 through 19 introduce the 11 Rules of Logical Inference in this order: Conjunction, Implication, Reiteration, Disjunction, Negation, and Equivalence.  Then 18 more derived rules are added to the mix for Game 20, the PC (Propositional Calculus) game.  The 21st and final game, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, takes the PC game and adds timed moves for rapid and chaotic scoring.

1656,Smokers Wild,1978,4.99104,67,1.2,2,6,120,120,,Humor ,,"In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).

The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.

Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.

Summary
Doctor Who, Battle for the Universe, is a game of battles and challenges for two, three, or four players. One player takes the part of The Doctor, and the others become one of his three arch enemies, i.e. Davros, The Master, or the Cyber Controller. Each of these characters has a team of four followers, Davros and four Daleks, The Doctor and his assistants, etc. There are also many other characters in the game that may be recruited. By collecting these characters each player tries to build a powerful team. By a series of battles and challenges, players fight for control of the universe until only two players remain and a final great battle decides the victor.

Characters
There are four main characters in the game, each having a team of four loyal assistants. These are: 1) The Doctor and his four assistants, Tegan, Ace, Romana and K9; 2) Davros and four Daleks; 3) The Master and his evil Time Lords, Morbius, Borusa, Omega and Rani; 4) The Cyber Controller with four Cybermen.

The remaining cards comprise three Ice Warriors, three Mutants, two Marshmen, The Black Guardian, Linx, Shockeye and Garron. Each card lists the character's Inner Force (his inherent strength), and a list of weapons and devices with which he is skilled.

Set Up
Each player rolls the die -  the highest scorer becomes The Doctor, and takes the character card of The Doctor and places it in front of them. The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board. (The ring of weapons and devices) on the space marked by the Magic Recorder. The Doctor can then place ONE of his white counters on any one of the Tardis spaces on the three main movement rings on the board. The other players can now place their counters on any of the Hyperspace squares on the board, though not on the same space as another player. The other character cards are left in the box for easy access during the game.

Movement (always clockwise) is determined by rolling the die. You can move from one ring to another as long as it does not involve an anti-clockwise movement. You land on spaces that allow you to take certain actions: collect a character, hyperspace to any other hyperspace square, Battle Zone 1, 2, or 3. You select a character for battle and the silver counter is moved based upon a die roll, thus selecting your weapon for the battle.

The ring of weapons and devices is only used during battle and challenges.

The rules contain sections for How to play with 3 Players and How to play with 2 Players

Playing Personally Incorrect is a way to connect, break the ice, and interact.

Personally Incorrect does this by directing the questions at the individuals playing the game instead of just offering a fill in the blank question

The player with the most 'Question' cards at the end of the 10th round is the winner. Players begin the game with 10 'Answer' cards, and receive a new one each turn. Every turn a player will read a 'Question' card aloud submitting another player's name into the Insert Name quotations. The rest of the players will simultaneously select answers and submit them to the player who read the question.

The active player now shuffles all of the answer cards together and reveals them 1 at a time. All of the other players present quickly vote for the most appropriately inappropriate answer. It is important to vote quickly as the last vote will not count that way players don't base their vote on another player's vote. In the event of a tie, the active player/reader is allowed to cast their vote in order to break the tie. The player whose answer received the most votes now claims the question card, ending the round.

There were a great variety of cards arranged into types which included artist profiles, quests, tactics, advanced game rules, checklists, spells, and shields, but the main cards were Fighters.

Each Fighter card had a series of 25 silver scratch panels around its main central illustration to represent locations of the body. For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card.

Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first. Lord Magnoble's quest was worth 200 gold if you identified the artists of the five unsigned pieces in his collection.

Within the entire series there were 139 cards in the basic series, eight treasure cards (T1-T8), a checklist (card 148), card#149 and the final card #150, which you could only get from Steve Jackson himself.

13714,Qubic,1947,5.22534,162,1.6667,2,6,15,15,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Paper-and-PencilPattern Building,"Qubic, which has been released multiple times by multiple publishers under various names and credited to various designers, is a placement game played on the 64 positions in a 3D board with four levels and a four-by-four grid on each level. The object is to get four in a row, whether on one level or between all four levels, straight or diagonal. It is essentially a Tic-Tac-Toe game in a 4x4x4 cube.

The cube needs to be emptied before start. Each player choose a color of their pieces and take turn to place their pieces in vacant positions, one piece at a time. The player wins who first gets four in a row of his own pieces - either horizontal, vertical or diagonal. It is not allowed to remove or replace pieces that have already been placed. If all positions are occupied without anyone having four in a row, then the game is called a tie.

A rule that makes it less advantageous to begin, is to prohibit the first player from placing his first piece in either a corner position or in one of the eight center positions.

Similar to:

    3D Tic Tac Toe - which is played on 3x3x3 grid
    Flix - which uses dice to control placement of men on 4x4x4 grid 
    Four Letter Words - though with words

Cards are drawn from an emergency deck which directs players to certain areas of the board. By use of a numbered spinner, players attempt to make it to the emergency spot and return to their home location. Stop signs and single land roads may limit movement at times.

A hospital card may also be drawn from the card pile which forces a player to proceed to the hospital prior to completing a mission. If a player holds more than one hospital card, this may be passed to another player if landing on the same space.

The first player to complete 3 missions is the victor.

2782,Vantage,1985,4.26562,32,1,2,4,30,30,,Card Game Memory ,MemorySet Collection,"There are 106 cards: 5 suits (red, yellow, green, blue, purple) of 1-14, four Wild cards and 28 Action cards (Cards Up, Black Out, Pass One, Lose One). Each suit contains one special BIG card used in scoring (Red 10, Yellow 6, Green 7, Blue 12, Purple 2). Initial deal is four, Action cards in a separate stack.

On your turn, you turn over an Action card and follow its instructions. You then match, build or discard one card from your hand. Cards Up turns all cards on the table face up, Black Out face down. Pass One means everyone passes a card to one's right. Lose One means you put a card down face up.

Matching concerns the card values; you can collect cards of the same value as the played card, or pairs of cards that add up to that value. Building means you match as above but leave the matched cards as a pile, vulnerable to another player's matching. This is usually done so you can collect another card from your own hand (so you would Build eights with the table's 5+3 and your 8, hoping to Match eights on your next turn with your other 8). Discarding is what you do if you cannot Match or Build. This increases the table's pool of cards open for matching or building.

After you've played your 4 cards in this way, another round ensues, and so forth until the entire deck has been gone through. Scoring is +10 for the most cards collected, +8 for the most Purple cards collected, +6 for the most Red cards collected, +4 for each BIG card collected, +2 for each 1 card, +2 for each Wild card.

During a Black Out, you must memorize which card is which; if you declare a play but get the cards wrong, your played card is simply added to those already face down on the table.

The components of the game are several of the basic Pokmon and a D6.  The attacks of each Pokmon have a difficulty, and if you roll one of the numbers that make the attack succeed, the attack succeeds.

A clever and simple system, the D6 system is a very good way to run some simplified RPG games with your non-dicechucking friends.  It goes great with games similar to Heroquest for those who don't like difficult rules.

This game is also a great way of getting younger players into the gaming hobby and introduce them to RPGs.

123417,Bagatelle,1819,4.23333,30,1,2,0,0,0,,Action / Dexterity Comic Book / Strip Movies / TV / Radio theme Novel-based Space Exploration ,,"A bagatelle board resembles a light, flat board with nails (pins!) in it and short raised sides to keep the ball on the playfield during play.  Each ball is launched from some sort of spring-loaded 'shooter' or cue, to the top of the board, where it then rolls towards the player, bouncing off the pins or landing in any of several scoring pockets.  These scoring pockets can be depressions in the playfield, nails arranged in a U-shape, or both.  They are marked with various score values, with the higher values usually protected by more pins or tougher paths to reach them.  By shooting the ball harder or softer, the player can try to control where the ball drops.

A spring-loaded shooter is normally in the bottom right corner of the board. A ball is placed before the shooter mechanism. The shooter devise is pulled back and let go, with the aim to fire the ball up to the rounded end of the board and then to bounce around the nails or pins and, hopefully, land in a scoring area. A cue shooter is just a wooden object, rather like a miniature version of a Billiards cue. To launch a ball, the player merely shoots it by hitting the back of the ball with the cue thus sending it to the top of the board.

Note that it is possible for a ball not to score at all. This usually means that the ball reached the bottom of the board without settling into a scoring pocket.

Typically, a player might get 3 or more balls and a note of the total score achieved is taken. The first to reach a pre-agreed number of points, wins.

Bagatelle sets can be made of wood, metal or plastic and they can be of any size (but it must be able to stand on an average table). They are often linked to a theme, really as an excuse to feature related graphics. The game is a direct ancestor of modern Pinball machines.

Paris: Weve just learned that the famous Professor Tournesol has been kidnapped.
After months of work in his laboratory, Professor Tournesol was on the verge of an invention that would, without a doubt, make the headlines. But, this last Monday, he did not show up for a gathering to which his friends had invited him. Tintin, the famous reporter, and Captain Haddock, the old sea-wolf, knew that, since the previous week, rumours abounded about the Professors invention. They went to his laboratory, accompanied by Milou, Tintins dog, and the detectives Dupond and Dupont, summoned in great haste. Once there, traces of a struggle were found that indicated that, without a doubt, the Professor had been kidnapped! Speculation is that the kidnappers intended to wrest the secret of his invention from the Professor.
Immediately, Tintin and his friends launched themselves in pursuit of the kidnappers.

The players move on the board trying to gather as much information as possible. They are trying to find out in which house Professor Tournesol is being held, and by whom.

The game proceeds by elimination of possibilities, as one must rule out all other possible houses and suspects before reaching a conclusion. For example, the proof-cards (orange backed cards) show the following objects: a hat, sunglasses, a mustache, a crowbar and shoes. The two proof-cards on the board indicate which objects the kidnapper lost while fleeing Professor Tournesols laboratory. The kidnapper will therefore *not* have those objects on him.

12623,UWO,2004,5.30099,202,1.7143,2,2,45,45,,Card Game Fighting Humor ,Hand Management,"UWO's (unidentified walking objects) are residents of the planet Znorf. There are two kinds of UWO; The Gnorfs and the Pnorfs. Both of them are able to morf. But that is something that will be explained later on. The Gnorfs think that the Pnorfs are a group of ugly creatures and that feeling is completely mutual. All the more reason for them to start a war!

beginning of the game
UWO is a cardgame and a boardgame at the same time. Both players have six energy cards. The playing field is formed by the energy cards of both players. One player places them horizontally, directly in front of him. The other player does this at the side vertically, just like on the photo. The playing field is between these energy cards. 
Both players place their ten 'regular' UWO's of their own color in front of them in two rows of five each. The players shuffle their pack of cards and place them both upside down in front of them.

energy
Just like life on our planet, life on Znorf is expensive too. Everything you do will cost you Energy. you have to pay it for morfing, walking or fighting. Strong UWO's use much energy. If both players used all of their six energy, then a round is over. Everyone gets back his energy. But beware! If you're out of energy and your opponent isn't yet, he will play several turns at once! And for your opponent, weak (and cheap) UWO's come in handy now. They can do a lot of damage to you!

many different UWO's
There are no less than eight different UWO's in the game. Some are riding Knorfs (strange animails). They can trample everyone. Others are cowards, hiding in bunkers, etc.
UWO's carry many different weapons. Lasers, dynamite, granades, bazooka's, etc. The bazooka UWO for instance, is one of the coolest of the gang and he himself thinks so too. He is extremely powerful. He can even blow up tanks! Unfortunately, such a bazooka is a great danger to our tiny UWO. Each time he has shot someone, he will be knocked out until the end of your next turn!
UWO's are specialists. Every UWO has protection against a specific other UWO. For instance, a UWO in a tank has protection against one who fights with his bare hands.

dynamite UWO
Well, let's just say there's only one of it on each side. One who can be quite important to both players...

morfing
UWO's can morf in exchange for one energy point: UWO cards may be placed on UWO's that are already in the game. This way, a regular UWO can be morfed into anything you want to, just like that! This can be very useful. Imagine a laser UWO threatening you. Your opponent announces that it's going to attack!! Don't panic, his UWO can never hit you when you are hiding in a bunker! So, when you have this card, just morf your furry alien into one and shoot back...and hope your opponent doesn't morf his UWO into a grenade UWO...

the pack of cards
At the end of each turn each player may refill his/her cards to 3. But beware, players can run out of cards. The game still goes on untill all UWO's of one player in the battlefield are destroyed. It is very easy for an opponent to adapt his army to yours, when you are not able to morf anymore! Imagine your opponent creating a small army of laser UWO's to attack your last bazooka UWO! They have protection against this weapon. You may panic now, cause your lost.
In the pack of cards, there are also nine miss cards. When you play this card, the shot will automatically be declared missed and of course you will have the chance to shoot back with this UWO. But don't play these cards to fast! Smart opponents remember how many you have left. When you lost them all, your opponent knows that every shot will be a hit. Sometimes it's smarter to just sacrifice a UWO, than to play a miss card.

53557,Colorio,2004,4.87031,64,1.2,2,5,15,15,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Memory,"Colorio starts with players using plastic tokens to cover the colored spaces on the 5x5 game board. On each turn, a player must remove three tokens from the board, then either remove all of them from play or place one or two of them back on the game board in spaces different from where they came. (Thus, at least one token is removed from the board each turn.) A player cannot remove the final token handled by the previous player.

If a player reveals the fifth space of a color, that player is eliminated from the game. In a two-player game, the remaining player wins. In a game with more players, the game continues with that color (and that player) being out of play; when the fifth space of another color is revealed, that player is also out of the game. Plays continues until one player remains in the game.

Akkon, 1189 AD. For weeks, the crusaders besieged the harbor cities in the holy land. There the death of their grandmaster shook up the knights of the Temple Order, and as the besiegers tried to find a successor for the grandmaster, a power struggle flared up among the Temple knights.

The players take on the roll of dignitaries in the Temple Order during the Third Crusade to the holy land. They strive to expand the power of their order in order to increase its gold and renown of the Temple Knights and spread belief in the holy land. This choice group in the Temple Order will determine the most capable member under them to become the new grandmaster.

Each player has 7 Temple Knights available each round. The player must use them in order to buy city cards, to finish them, and to increase gold, belief, power, and the appearance of the Temple Order. Whoever does this the best will receive additional privileges to help him realize his goals. Only the player who uses all of his possibilities and keeps his opponents in mind will be triumphant in the end.

SECTION X is a game in which clever escapees dig tunnels themselves but also make use of tunnels belonging to other players and cut each other off. Special hiding places ensure that the prisoners are safe when the ruthless prison guards make their rounds. A rumor has spread that an escape is imminent, so it becomes more and more difficult to remain out of the hands of the guards. Doors lock the entrances to the different escape tunnels. Are you able to control the underground network of tunnels and lead the prisoners from your cell block to freedom first? But watch out! The prisoners risk their lives if the escape is discovered!

Brave knights are gathering to plan their honourable endeavours and to find out who will be the bravest Paladin facing the most honourable missiona.

Goal
To collect as many honour points as possible by winning  mission cards.

Setup
Each player gets 5 player tokens of one colour.

The 18 mission cards are sorted into two stacks, according to their honour point values (1-6). Each stack is shuffled separately, then the stack with the lower value mission cards (queen's deck, values 1-3) is placed on top of the other (king's deck, values 4-6).

Mission cards equal to the number of players are laid out, face up.

The card dealer shuffles the 42 paladin cards and hands out 4-6 (depending on the number of players) cards to each player. Paladin cards have values from 0-9.

Game play
Each player, beginning with the start player, puts one of his/her paladin cards next to one of the mission cards, face down, and marks it with one of his/her player tokens. This paladin is called the leading paladin. When each mission card has a leading paladin, players continue playing cards clockwise until each player has placed a card beside each mission.
Before placing a card, players may look at one of the cards another player has already placed. Each player can only play one paladin per mission. 
When each player has only one card left, the paladin cards are resolved, starting with the first mission and the first card that was placed there. Each player has the following options:

     Beat the leading paladin if your card has a higher value (or in case they are equal, if it is a red number).
     Take the face-down paladin card back on your hand.
     Discard the face-down paladin card.




This continues until all cards at the first mission have been dealt with. The player whose card is the last to stay wins the mission and places it, together with the winning paladin card, in front of him/herself. The same is done for the other mission cards.

The player with the fewest honour points is the dealer of the next round and hands out paladin cards until everyone has the same number of cards as in the first round. The dealer then lays out new mission cards and determines a start player.

The game ends when there are not enough mission cards left for another round. Each player counts the honour points from the missions he/she won and adds bonus points for all paladin cards with red numbers that the/she has in front of him/herself. The player with the most points wins the game.

The new neon-green-and-purple JX has blocks with slanted sides, allowing the players to construct towers that lean precariously to one side without toppling due to the weight distribution that the new blocks allow.

The game can be played as a competitive exercise where each player tries placing his block in a position so that the next player's block will make the tower fall over. Alternatively, it can be a cooperative exercise where the players try to make the tower go as high as possible without collapsing.

					Is The Tower of Mystery for You?
 The Tower of Mystery is highly competitive and very interactive without being highly strategic!  Everyone's always involved in the game, even when it's not their turn to move their playing piece!  The game is completely different every time you play!

Warning:  If a board game needs to be all about strategy, setup, and the win in order for you to enjoy it, then you may want to avoid The Tower of Mystery because it's a rapidly changing game that's frequently outside of your complete control.

But if you enjoy a purely social game that's all about player interaction, fun, laughter, and the journey, then chances are great that you'll love the Tower of Mystery!  Social gamers of all ages (adults, college students, teens) and Families enjoy the game!

The Tower of Mystery contains no occult elements, magic, spells, or evil characters.

				
					Detailed Game Description
 The Tower of Mystery combines luck, unpredictability, and a dash of strategy make this an exciting, lively game for everyone. Because up to eight players can play, nobody is left out! It's competitive, interactive, rapidly changing, and fun!

Everyone starts in the Garden outside the Tower. Travel around the tower's seven levels, take secret passages, and use staircases, in an attempt to visit each of the four turrets in the tower (in no particular order) and collect a turret token. Once you have all four turret tokens, and have collected Mystery Cards that spell the word TOWER, declare your impending win to the other players and then head back to the Garden!  The first person to return to the Garden with Mystery Cards spelling TOWER and has a turret token from each of the four turrets, wins the game!

When playing The Tower of Mystery, you win by constantly adjusting your game-play based on unexpected events.  No matter how masterful you think your plan for winning the game is, it WILL be up-ended by your opponents, and the crazy events that occur within the tower. Your goal is to keep moving towards achieving the game objectives as best you can!  During the game, players move around the seven levels, up and down staircases, and into the four turrets, landing on board spaces where things happen. Sometimes a player may get money or lose money, get or lose Mystery Cards, may get to roll the dice and see what happens, might have the chance to swap the location of their playing piece with another player's piece, steal cards or money from other players, or any of many different scenarios and possibilities.

In addition to the TOWER Mystery Cards, there are Mystery Cards that allow you to do nice things to yourself, or try to stop your opponents.  There are several ways to collect Mystery Cards. Some ways are free, others cost money. The fastest but most risky way to collect free Mystery Cards is to stay in a turrent for multiple turns. However, while in a turret, a player is vulnerable because they cannot play any Mystery Cards. Players can collect up to 3 free Mystery Cards per turn while in a turret so even though it's risky to stay in a turret for very long, there's definitely a benefit to visiting the turrets even though playing Mystery Cards there is a no-no.

Players can play any number of Mystery Cards on any other players (or themselves) even when it's not their turn! This can cause mayhem when several players suddenly jump into the action at the same time!  You will have to alter your plans over and over in order to stay ahead of your opponents!  Almost constant player interaction keeps everyone on their toes, all the while laughing and having fun every step of the way!

At the end of each turn that a player's piece is in a turret, they must draw a Turret Card. Turret Cards might affect only the player drawing the card, might affect everyone in the game, or several players but not all.  One thing is for sure: Turret Cards often dramatically change the game for everyone in an instant! Some Turret Cards are helpful, but most of them cause unexpected, often funny events to happen to some or all of the players in the game!

While money is a component of the game, it has no bearing on winning the game! Tower Bucks are used to buy Mystery Cards and pay penalties. Being broke is risky, because if a player is completely broke and they have to pay a fine to the bank or a penalty to another player, they lose three turns!  Hoarding money serves no purpose, however, so each player has to decide how much money is enough to keep and how much is safe to spend.

The Tower of Mystery is a great Party Game for all ages! Adults young and old enjoy playing The Tower of Mystery when together for their regular social Game Night. Families enjoy it for Family Game Night because it's equally playable for both the kids and the parents. It is suitable for children as young as about eight as long as they are able to read the cards and know the best time to play their cards. Teens enjoy The Tower of Mystery because it's so unpredictable and lively.  Even retired yacht club ladies have been known to give up their Friday afternoon dominoes to play The Tower of Mystery!  If you enjoy great player interaction, surprises, laughter and fun, then the Tower of Mystery is the game for you!

Heralds carry tidings all through the land: the battle for Kings Bounty is at hand! Fearless adventurers from throughout the kingdom gather forces under their banners, while prominent lords fortify their castles to withstand a siege. The whole world has turned upside down in the fever of war: dwarves have been seen defending the elves woodland strongholds against legions of the undead, great dragons have razed ancient obelisks to the ground, while heroes have used both brute force and cunning to capture enemy castles. The King can barely keep up with awarding commanders their well-earned titles for valor and heroism on the field of battle, and theres not a single distinguished title that hasnt already changed hands at least a dozen times. After all, its not the strength of your castle or the size of your army that counts  only the favor of the supreme ruler will decide who ultimately merits receiving the Kings Bounty.

Gameplay:

Based on the bestselling video game of the same name, Kings Bounty is a board game thats played with cards. The players take control of one of five races  elves, dwarves, orcs, humans or the undead  and use their armies to capture castles and obelisks, earning victory points in the process. However, the main battle will be fought over titles, which are far more valuable than land in ensuring victory. At the end of the match, the players who have completed the required objectives earn the titles and the victory points that go with them. Finally, the scores get tallied up, and a winner is determined.

Game contents:


    48 Troop cards of 5 races 


Every race except for humans has 9 troop cards: 3 archers, 2 fighters, 2 wizards, 1 hero and 1 monster. Humans have 4 archers, 3 fighters, 3 wizards, 1 hero and 1 monster.


    36 Property cards, including 24 Castle cards  12 Obelisk cards


Castle cards. Every race except for humans has 6 castles: 2 towers, 2 fortresses and 2 citadels. Humans dont have any castles.

Obelisk cards. The game has 4 obelisks with powers 1, 2 and 3. All obelisks are neutral (meaning they dont belong to any one race) and each yields 2 victory points.

In the near future, combat between armed and armored cars will be an arena sport. You shoot at the other cars, trying to destroy their tires and armor. The last player with an operating car is the winner!

In each battle, or duel, the players play cards to damage each others' cars. When one side of a player's car is breached (the armor on that side is destroyed), the car's driver may be attacked! If a car's driver is disabled and unable to operate his car, the player who disabled him scores a kill. (Note that the driver will be back for the next duel! Only the car is killed.) When only one car is left (or when time runs out), the duel is over. New duels continue until one player has scored 60 points to become an Ace!

Operation Felix is a what if... game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41, shortly after the fall of France. Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.

Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies). Optional rules for SS reinforcements and greater German amphibious capacity.

Each player starts with $20,000 and a hand of 4 cards, each with a word (Lethargy) and four other numbered words (1. potency, 2. mutability, 3. felicity, 4. vigor).  In the middle of the board are 4 numbered spaces, 1-4.  At some spaces on the board you are allowed to play antonyms, others synonyms.  You may play up to 4 cards with the proper type to an unfilled number space equal to the number of the appropriate word.  For example on the above card, 4. vigor is an antonym for lethargy and could be played in the #4 spot on the board if empty and you are on a play antonym space.  If on your turn you fill the 4th space you publish a book and clear all the spaces.  If a player plays all 4 cards from his hand in a turn he also publishes a book.  A player may also publish a book by passing the start space (Go).   If any player feels that a card has been played incorrectly he may challenge the play.  He states what he thinks the correct play is and bets $1000.  The playing player may then call or raise in increments of $1000, back and forth until called.  The person who is correct gets the money, and if the challenger is correct the challenged card is returned to the player's hand.  At the end of a player's turn he fills his hand back to 4 cards.  Other spaces on the board require a player to pay money, allow him to collect money, or require all players to pass cards from their hands to other players.

6868,Hear Me Out,2002,5.03214,84,1.4167,3,6,60,60,,Humor Party Game ,StorytellingVoting,"First edition:

Rather silly party game, distributed by a certain coffee retail powerhouse that will remain nameless.

As one moves around the board, one can land on _Brainstorm_ (vaguely reminiscent of free-association Scattergories), _Survey Says!_ (a touch like the Family Feud TV game show), or present a short _Sound Bite_ to the other players, who will vote on presentation and persuasiveness.

To make sure no-one takes the proceedings too seriously, there's a _Skid Row_ space (lose all points, and beg the other players to donate.  Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.

Like all such games, it works well with the right crowd.

Second edition:

Hear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as Nuclear BLANK). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.

What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.

11683,Chicken of the Sea,1994,4.41667,36,2.5,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Ancient Nautical Wargame ,Dice RollingHex-and-Counter,"Chicken of the Sea is a game included in issue #3 of GameFix magazine.  It's a wargame simulation of the battle of Drepanum, 249 BC (Rome vs Carthage).  The title comes from a rather audacious act of the Roman admiral, Claudius the Handsome.  He was told by the official augurs that the portents were not good for a naval battle: the sacred chickens will not eat.  Claudius threw the sacred chickens into the sea, saying then let them drink.

The game comes with 100 counters representing both ships and informational counters, an 11 x 17 map (28x43 cm), and eight pages of illustrated rules with sidebars.  A small game by wargame standards.

The basic sequence is mutual assignment of speed to galleys, Carthaginian ships move then board, and finally Roman ships move then board.  Facing is important, ramming, fouling other ships and sheering oars are all possible.  Melee fighting is common.  There are optional command/control/formation rules.

All in all, fairly low complexity as wargame simulations go.

Pictureka! is a new kind of game, both in mechanic as in artwork. The mechanic is invigorating with its large square gaming tiles. The game board is composed of 3 by 3 game tiles, so the game board on which is played is a huge square of 63 cm x 63 cm. This is large enough for several players to be able to play the game at the same time. The game board is alive, it is not a static board as the tiles are flipped over, turned and moved. So it is not possible to memory map the board. The mechanic of an ever changing board makes it not only fun; also the challenge is kept into the game all the time.

A game turn 
Players will have to throw a color dice at the beginning of their turn. According to the color thrown (3 possibilities) they must draw a mission card of the same color. There are 3 kinds of missions.

How to win the game? 
Be the first one to have successfully accomplished 10 missions. Each successful mission gives 1 point, so be the first one to get 10 points. 
The artwork is something not to be found in standard games. The personal drawing style of the artist Eugene makes this a kind of playing artwork.

Components

9  game tiles
1  die (6-sided - standard d6)
1  color die (6-sided - 2 red, 2 green, 2 blue)
55 mission cards

The lid is placed on top of them. The lid has nine dials. Each dial has one of six symbols showing. To access the treasure cards beneath the lid the players alternate turns to twist the dials to show the combination of symbols which match the genie card that is in play. When the genie card has been matched, the player may take as many treasure cards as desired. If a player finds a snake card among the treasure cards taken then the player forfeits all treasure cards taken that turn. Whenever a player is done taking treasure cards a new genie card is put in play and the game continues.

The game ends when the final genie card is out of play or the final snake has been found. The player with the highest total in treasure cards is the winner. The game is in German, French, and Spanish.

Each player receives 10 cards which come in 4 suits (orange and red female + Grey

The rules state whoever is the most miserable goes first. You can perform 1 of 3 actions on a turn.  Play a card that is higher than the top card on the discard pile (which ends your turn), Play a pair of same suit cards whose sum is less than the top card (this does not end your turn and you must then take another action) or draw cards from stock. (You must keep drawing till you draw a male and female card. These cards are shown to the other players. This does end your turn.)

Every time you play a pair you skip the next player in turn.  If you play 2 pairs you skip the next two players, etc.  You can never skip yourself so in a 3-player game if you play 3 pairs, then end your turn by drawing or playing a single card, you then take another turn.

When playing a pair you may place them in any order. When the stock is empty you shuffle the draw pile (except for the top card I would presume) and continue play.

A hand is won when one person is out of cards.  He receives the total points left in all other players hands.  The rules state that you play for several rounds.

Five hundred cards outline the cases--and with names like Trespassing Hounds, Shocking News, Forced Nuptials, and Quality Chicken, players are sure to be intrigued. The game can be played by two players or two teams. To start, a team rolls the die. A 1, 2, or 3 lets them know how many scorecard spaces they can fill in if they arrive at the correct verdict. After reading a case, they deliberate, debate, and finally decide for or against the plaintiff. A correct verdict advances the team. An incorrect verdict leaves them cooling their heels. The first team to arrive at the finish line wins. Sometimes being judgmental feels good. --Wendy Slotboom

This is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.

You start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.

Each turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?  or  How many Jealousy cards have you seen?  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.

Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.

Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.

Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!

813,Goosebumps: Terror in the Graveyard Game,1995,5.244,100,1.2,2,4,45,45,Children's,Children's Game Horror Novel-based ,Modular Board,"This is a game that is a favorite of the kids.

This game must be assembled inside the game box. Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.

Each player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left paralyzed with fear.

There is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a Goosebumps space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.

During the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a magic potion square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.

Once a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins. If not, they can attempt to defeat the ghost on their next turn.

There are 12 board strips with green, orange and purple squares. The object of the game is to get one of each color (green, orange and purple) of your game pieces (one player is cubes and one player is pyramids) in a row (vertically or horizontally) on the matching colors of the board strips. The board strips are shuffled and dealt out 6 to each player. The first player lays one of their board strips and places one of their game pieces on one of the squares. Game pieces MUST be played on squares of the same color of the game piece. The next player may then either place one of their game pieces on the same board or lay down another board next to the first one long sides touching and places one of their game pieces on the board strip just played. After all 6 of a player's game pieces have been played, they may move any of their game pieces to a new position, either on a board that has already been placed or on a new board. After all of a player's board strips have been placed, they are limited to placing their game pieces on the boards already in play. So ...


    You may ONLY play your pieces on a square that is the same color as that piece. (e.g. a purple piece can only be played on a purple square.)



    You may only place your board strips LONG sides touching with all squares aligned.



    If you lay a board strip down you MUST play a game piece on that board.



    If you choose not to lay down a new board strip on your turn, you MUST play a game piece on an existing board strip.



    The winning row of 3 game pieces may be all on 1 board or lengthwise over 3 boards, but it may not be diagonal.



    Only one game piece may be played on each square.



    You can ONLY move the position of your game pieces on the board after ALL of your pieces have been placed.


This is a 2-player game for ages 10 and over.

Players attempt to collect one of six types of sets while having to pass, dumpster-dive, discard, exchange and steal cards. The cards are illustrated with black and white ogre cartoons, and the instructions on the cards are in ogre-speak.

Publisher Blurb:

Ogre Bash is based on that time-honored Ogre tradition of standing around in a circle bashing each other on the head with clubs.

The Ogre Bash card game is just like that, except for the bashing each other on the head part.

When you play Ogre Bash, you're trying to get five cards either of the same kind or in one of the special winning sequences.  The catch is, you need to have it at the start of your turn.  Almost every time a card is played, you need to trade a card with another player, so although you may have a winning hand now, it may not be there when your turn comes around.

Just kind of makes you want to bash an Ogre on the head, doesn't it?

Amtik the god had a problem. The universe was internal to his 400,000km long self. He was god to the universes' inhabitants. Unfortunately, only the Holy Band truly believed in and worshipped Amtik. The unruly Sunthrowers believed in Amtik's existence, however, they also believed that life was not an end, but a by-product of systems design. Amtik was in danger! The Sunthrowers were hurling stars at his universe sensor ducts. The Holy Band wanted his divine intervention. A sun in the ducts would dissipate poor Amtik and free his creations. While the Holy Band mightily struggled to believe and triumph, Amtik might even get bored and turn-off his universe - is a puzzlement.

All the game pieces fit in a neat little printed bag. 

From the Handbook Of Pirate Lore:
The Rules - The top has six sides. The marks generally mean:
T1 - The spinner, or pirate in this case, takes one (1) Ante from the pot.
T2 - The spinner takes two (2) Antes from the pot.
P1 - The spinner Re-Antes one (1) into the pot
P2 - The spinner Re-Antes two (2) into the pot
AP - The spinner and All Players Re-Ante one (1) into the pot
TA - The spinner Takes All

The spinner establishes the Ante amount to start a round. There can be any number of rounds to a game. The Ante can be anything from a set amount of money, to goats. That's why soldiers and pirates loved this game! Any spinner can start a round of play. The top can be passed in any direction as long as it maintains that same direction the entire round.

This game is a simple repackaging of traditional Teetotum or the later 60's version Put & Take Game

This one is the World War II Pacific Campaign game. The players are in a race with each other to reach the final objective --the main Japanese HQ. The Japanese defense forces (14 pieces) are obstacles for all players; when defeated, it is redeployed by the player that defeated it and can thus be judiciously used to slow down opponents.

Each player has 6 pieces (2 Marines, 2 infantry, 1 naval landing support ship and 1 strategic air support aircraft). On your turn, you roll the die and move one of your pieces. The support pieces move only on a 6 and are immediately deployed where needed (to support a beach landing). Moving a land piece on top of an opponent's by exact count relieves it --sends it back to its start space. There are two beaches of each color that must be cleared and only the player of that color can do it. To do this, both support pieces must first be brought to bear, and then a Marine must reach the defender by exact count. Once cleared, beaches remain clear and can be used by all players.

The mechanics are a variant of the old public domain game of Malefiz or Barricade.

The game is set during the pressure cooker situation of the early 90's and the tension of the game certainly reflects this. Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the oil/money to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.

Each of the four states of Tirad, Urgad, Galad and Elgad has one large city.  Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...

Each player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.

This is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra lives and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.  Still, pretty enjoyable.

Welcome to world of Storm the Castle!, a 1-4 player semi-cooperative game in which you take the exciting role of one of the four marauding Dark Forces armies in a race to breach Castle StormHaven's walls, overrun the defenders, and claim victory by reaching the castle's keep first.

Breaching Castle StormHaven's thick walls is no easy feat. It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.

The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!

Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.

Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed the Boss by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss' army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven's defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.

Now the four dark force armies  Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host  begin their long march east.

Dark Force Army Overview

Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! Its how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.

The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.

Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.
Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!

The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results. These masters of the forbidden arcane arts use their talents to manipulate the minds and outcomes of events of their allies and enemies. Players who enjoy using tactics that harness deadly magics and powers to manipulate events will surely enjoy the awesome power of the Arcanists.

Pros: Incredible power cards that can shift game elements to your favor. Several long range spells and abilities to generate quick magic. 
Cons: Many of your units have low health and are easily destroyed.

The Undead Horde: The walking dead from the Blacksoot Swamps know of one thing - how to feed! Their power derives from their ever increasing numbers and ability to sustain damage while pressing forward. Players looking to overwhelm the Fantasy Defenders with hordes of undead while using dark magic will find great pleasure in fielding this army.

Pros: Your units cause fear and can take quite a bit of damage.  Inexpensive units allow you to swarm and overrun the Fantasy Defenders defenses. 
Cons: Though your units are many, they dont hit hard. Magic can be hard to build up as its dependent upon how many undead units you have in play.

The Dark Elves: From the deep recesses of forgotten lands nestled deep within the earth come the masters of marauding, the Dark Elves. Known for their exceptional arts in battlefield tactics and archery, no foe is safe from the tips of their arrows to the teeth of their treachery. Players who revel in treachery, backstabbing and shooting should choose the Dark Elves.

Pros:  Awesome ranged attacks and power cards to support them. Treacherous power cards give you a unique competitive edge against other players.
Cons: Squishy units means youve got to know when to fight and when to move in. Players may give you strange can I trust you looks. Lack of strong melee units.

When all the cards have been taken, the player with the most cards wins.

You may:
1. Travel the trail

3. Get at least one member of your party to Oregon
4. Stop and rest
5. Decide which of your friends will  die of dysentery
6. Write your name on a tombstone

All sorts of gruesome deaths await you and the rest of your wagon party in this official multi-player card game version of the classic computer game. To win youll need to keep one player alive all the way from Independence, MO to the Willamette Valley. But between rattlesnakes, starvation, dead oxen, broken bones, dysentery, and a host of other calamities the odds are long . . . almost as long as the Oregon Trail itself.

Players work together to move along the trail, fording rivers and playing Supply Cards to overcome calamities. But be warnedthere will be times when it makes sense to let one of your wagon mates succumb to a calamity rather than expend precious supplies. And every time players go the way of all flesh, youll flip over the roster card and write their names on tombstones (dont forget to include a quick epitaph). Its a great way to relive your fond memories of one of the worlds most beloved computer games, and to kill off your family and friends at the same time.

This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his Kampf in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's Iron Dream, a pulp-tale about Ubermenschen conquering a future world filled with mutant scum. The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this theme into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed to avoid copyright infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book. One asks why this bittersweet parody has actually to be played as a game, but everybody can decide for him/herself I guess...

1964,Campaign,1971,5.40909,341,2.3276,2,4,120,120,Strategy,Napoleonic Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemDice Rolling,"Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.

An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy

Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page The Years of Napoleon historical booklet.

The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.

Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.

There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.

The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.

The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.

Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.

Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.

The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call odd and even) being unable to assist the other.

A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.

The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.

Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.

from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat

41334,Scary Tales: Snow White vs. The Giant,2009,5.13259,145,1.3571,2,2,20,20,,Card Game Fantasy ,Hand Management,"Snow White vs. The Giant is the second game in the Scary Tales series of two-player games pitting common fairy tale characters against each other. Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:

Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum...you don't want to mess with this chum. The Giant can crush his foes with his enormous strength, and he has his Magic Hen on his side, as well. But sly Snow White is no longer her sweet self, and she has some tricks up her sleeve, including the assistance of her Seven Dwarfs. Will the kingdom thrive under the rule of either of these challengers? A battle of enormous proportions awaits!

The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.

Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.

The players maneuver armies on a world map, trying to conquer continents, and trying to fulfill their objectives.

This is the flagship game of Grow Jogos e Brinquedos and it has spawned four sequels of its own --- WarII, War Junior, War: Imprio Romano (35-year anniversary edition) and War: Batalhas Mitolgicas (40-year anniversary edition).

Widely accepted as the first (and, probably, only) mainstream wargame in Brazil. Players are given tons of little army units to place onto the map of the world.  When it's your turn, you use your units to attack other players' positions, hopefully with superior numbers.  Combat is a simple dice rolling affair that stresses attrition, and reinforcements are given to players who collect sets of cards.

SUMMARY OF PLAY
Each player draws 6 Domos. The player with the highest starting double goes first. After the starting doublet is placed on the table, each player in turn tries to match by color, number or word. The words on the Domos add excitement to the game by reversing the direction of play, skipping the next player or instruction the next player to draw a certain number of additional Domos. The first player to get rid of his Domos is the winner.

MATCHING DOMOS
In general, Domos are matched by UNO rules and arranged DOMINO style. Match by color, number, or word. But play is limited to the 4 directions of play from the starting doublet. When playing the MATCHING SIDE always constitutes the play.

If at any time you are unable to match color, number or word, you MUST draw ONE Domo from the remaining stock. If the drawn Domo is playable, you may play it immediately. If it is unplayable, it is added to your hand and play passes to the left to the next player.

Other players in turn must follow with the same number of cards featuring a higher numeric value or pass.  If two players put down the same single card in a row, the next player's in line misses a turn.

With a deck of questions for adults, and a separate deck for kids, it's a game the whole family will enjoy!

Put out by Disney with Mattel as a home-grown trivia game, it offers several unique characteristics: the game comes in a high quality tin/metal film can, and has 'mickey' shaped player pawns with stackable mouse ears rather than wedges.  The playing board is shaped like the iconic Mickey mouse head, with ears that fold inward for storage in the round container.

All questions are Disney-related (unlike Trivial Pursuit that has only 1 or 2 Disney questions per card.)

Includes 400 Adult cards (2000 questions) and 100 Kids' cards (500 questions) with a picture clue.

For the true Disney-ologist, questions will be easy and playtime quick, but for just a casual fan, it is more challenging.

Peasants from nearby villages collect amber, which is bought by merchants from distant lands. The barons know that the one who profits the most from the amber trade will become the most powerful ruler of the new lands.

In Amber, players take the role of the barons, and their goal is to build trade routes that connect their castles to the villages where the amber is collected, and to the other barons' castles where it is traded. To this end, players build roads through the wilderness  placing one tile each turn in the shared playing area  which will allow their buyers to reach the sources of the amber. Since all buyers can use the roads, however, it's important to have suitable connections with the road networks built by others. The baron whose castle is connected with the greatest number of villages and castles will become the richest and most respected Lord of the new land.

In the distant future, unexpected terror arises from unintended consequences as three factions battle for dominance and survival. From across the stars a great threat descends upon Earth. The Machine Horde  relentless in its determination to consume and expand  now threatens to exterminate Mankind. The Ancients, hyper-intelligent beings of unknown origins, manipulate the schemes of both human and machine to achieve their mysterious machinations. All that now stands between annihilation and survival for the human race is the Emergency Earth Coalition: a fragile unified human government rooted in fear and subjugation. Now's the time to choose your Faction Commander and lead your armies to total war.

PURGE: Sins of Science offers players a full strategy setting which eliminates luck of the draw and lack of resources. Inspired by traditional Real Time Strategy (RTS) computer games, PURGE allows players to upgrade their armies in various ways depending upon chosen technologies, Stronghold attachments and unit choices. Each player controls the flow and pace of army building through a one-of-a-kind gameplay system formulated to deliver a full strategy experience.

Players win the game by reducing their opponents' Stronghold Population to zero. But beware, the tide of battle can turn quickly as the unique game play allows for quick responses and counter-measures to almost every strategy.

PURGE: Sins of Science comes with six 50-card pre-constructed and expertly play-tested decks. Each 50-card deck is represented by a different faction Commander from the three (3) factions available to players. Each Commander has unique playing styles and abilities which offer players a wide range of playable deck types (Offense, Defense, Support).

Game 1

Each player draws four dice. Each player on their turn draws, rolls their dice, and places one of them in the dice tray. Any dice added to the tray must match by colour, number or letters. The first player to get rid of her dice is the winner.

Game 2

Game 2 is a variant of Yacht where the object is to have the highest points score after 11 rounds of play. The player draws five dice out of the bag and rolls all of them. The player may then take up to two more rolls with their choice of one or more of these five dice. Simply put aside the dice you do not want to roll, and roll the rest. Any of these dice may be rolled in any of your three rolls, except that all five must be rolled on the first roll. At the end of your turn, you must score your exposed dice faces in one of the eleven spaces in your column of the scoring sheet. If you cannot or do not wish to enter a score in any of the eleven spaces, then you must score a zero in your choice of one of the eleven spaces.

Game 3

All 24 spaces in the dice tray are used for Game 3. A player draws one die out of the bag, rolls it, and places it face up in any one of the 24 dice spaces in the tray. After the starting die is placed in the tray, the player to the left of the starting player draws four dice out of the bag and rolls them. The player looks at the dice to see if any of these can match the die already in the tray. The dice can match by either number, color or letter in any combination. If a match can be made, the player places the die in the tray and scores points. Dice are scored by making strings of two or more adjacent dice, all of the same color or kind. All numbered faces (0 through 9) score as their numerical value. The R, S and D2 each score as 20 points. The W and WD4 are not scored.

After a player finishes their turn, the next player takes a turn using the same dice. Thus a player will usually begin her turn with one less die than the previous player. In this way, the first player will have four dice to roll, the second three, the third will have two, and so on. When a player, down to only one die, is able to play it, then the next player starts the pattern over again by drawing four fresh dice from the bag, rolls them and play proceeds from there.

The game ends when the dice tray is full. The winner is the player with the highest total score.

Two to four players begin the game by choosing an ability-granting Role Card and starting in the United States. Players roll a die to initiate the zombie threat, represented by horde tokens of strengths 1 through 4 placed in zones around the board. Special grey zones represent lack of intel by featuring face-down tokens with zombie hordes of unknown strengths. Throughout the game, players travel to different zones and battle the zombie hordes in those locations by rolling dice and adding effects of Combat Cards.

The game features a die-based combat system. Humans always roll a six-sided die, while the hordes are represented by either a six-, eight-, ten-, or twelve-sided die depending on their strength. Humans may modify their role or add additional effects by playing Combat Cards, which consist of reusable Weapons (including Lobos, slang for Lobotomizers) and one-shot Tactics (like Booby Traps or Redeployment). Every time a human wins a battle, the zombie horde strength decreases by one level, while victories for zombies cause players to discard Combat Cards. At the end of each turn, humans draw a Threat Escalation card to reveal how the zombie threat has grown.

Though players start the game working together against the zombies, when a player loses all his Combat cards, he becomes one of the undead. Player-zombies can manipulate the hordes on the board to attack other humans and to escalate the zombie threat.

The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds based on the number of players (six rounds for four players, seven for three, and eight for two). At the end of the game, if more than ten total zombie hordes of strength 3 or 4 still remain on the map, the humans lose (and any zombie players win). If ten or fewer such hordes remain, the humans collectively win.

42132,Scary Tales: Little Red vs. Pinocchio,2009,5.14521,167,1.3333,2,2,20,20,,Card Game Fantasy ,Hand Management,"Little Red vs. Pinocchio is the second game in the Scary Tales series of two-player games pitting common fairy tale characters against each other. Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:

Little Red is a scorned girl on a mission to prove that you may be able to fool her once, but you can't fool her twice! Pinocchio is a fibbing, scheming puppet that won't let you pull his strings. They both want to rule over the land, and they've got the drive to win. With the help of their companions, the Woodsman and the Cricket, each of them will be tough to beat.

The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.

Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.

12634,Hispaniola,2004,5.15111,180,1.6071,3,5,30,30,,Card Game Pirates ,Trick-taking,"3 to 5 players lead groups of South Seas pirates, angling for the captain's positions on five ships that make up a small pirate fleet. Why? Well, that's obvious: the captains get the bulk of the booty.

All cards (in different colours and numbered from one to fifteen) are shuffled and dealt out (fewer when playing with fewer players). After the trump colour has been determined, a traditional trick-taking game ensues. Whenever a player wins a trick, they get to place one of their sailors onto the captain position of the ship that matches the colour of the trick. If that post is already taken, then the other player must vacate the spot. That can sometimes end up with a sailor being tossed overboard - but they're not out of the game, they seek safety on an island. The more sailors this happens to, the better their chance of being hired again.

At the end of the game, the captains and sailors on the ships are worth points - sailors stranded on islands worth minus points. Minus points are also awarded when a player wins many tricks during the game - which is why these won tricks can also be passed along.

In addition to your tanks, you deploy an Ammo Dump, a Fuel Dump, your HQ and five Anti-Tank guns (which do not move).

Your tanks are numbered but the opponent knows not which is which.  You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.

On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.

You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.

Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.  Tanks die if they end up on an enemy mine square.

What its not so obvious that they learn is that the quantity of water in the planet, in its different forms, does not increase or decrease over the centuries. The population is increasing fast, and that this is originating problems in the water cycle all over the world. This is leading to shortages of water in some regions and to very difficult life conditions.

In this game, players can influence the water cycle. The board represents the water cycle, with all the elements described above, each of them is numbered (from 1 to 6). Players throw dices and each of them choose a movement (one dice) that they want to do. Then they will have to move their water (colour cubes for each player) between those elements. The board also has the population, that is increasing at the same time its fed with water, and players will try to ensure the population gets the water that it needs. Only this way can they get points. If a player cannot do the movement for the die they chose (or were forced to choose), they LOSE 1 point

The player who can ensure the best balance of water between the different elements of the water cycle, whilst being able to give it to the population whenever there is an opportunity, will make more points and win the game.

On your turn you may either take one of the face up cards or the top card of the drawing pile. If it is a cow card you put in in front of you (without changing it's mood). If it is an action card, you perform the action thereby changing the cows' moods, stealing cows from other players, placing cows inside/outside the stables, etc. As an alternative to drawing a card you may also discard one of the face up which becomes out of play.

The game ends when the drawing pile is used up. The player with the most happy cows (after subtracting minus points for the sad cows) wins the game.

In most editions, there are five categories. Each category has five dollar amounts. Behind each dollar amount is an answer or trivia clue having to do with the category. When a player thinks he or she knows the correct response to the clue, that person signals and responds in the form of a question. A player is rewarded with the amount associated with the statement if correct, and penalized the corresponding amount if incorrect.

When the board is cleared, the process is repeated for Double Jeopardy with five new categories and double the stakes.

One statement in the first round and two statements in the second round are designated as Daily Doubles. Only the person who chose the statement may bet any or all of his or her winnings on giving the correct response.

One of the highest valued statements in one of the Double Jeopardy categories is saved for the last round, Final Jeopardy. In this phase, the players secretly bet any or all of their winnings and record their responses.

The player with the most amount of money at the end of the game is the winner.

The editions published by Parker Brothers and Outset Media are exceptional in that their gameplay features the same number of categories as the television series: six for the Jeopardy round, six for the Double Jeopardy round, and one for the Final Jeopardy round.

Rorschach contains 100 new and unique inkblot cards that are large, widely varied, and graphically stunning. The question deck covers a broad range of topics, keeping play fresh every time. One expansion is planned for the game, adding an even larger selection of questions and blots, and additional questions and inkblots will be available to print from www.bucephalus.biz.

					Description from the box

For high-rolling, high-stakes fun, you can't beat the winning combination of Yahtzee and Texas Hold'Em poker! The trick is to make the best 5-dice hand from your two personal pocket dice and 5 up-for-grabs dice. Each roll could shift your strategy: will two pair become three of a kind or a full house? Will you go for broke with an all-in-bet?

At showdown time, the player with the best poker hand wins the chips. The ultimate hand is a Yahtzee flush: 5-of-a-kind in the same color suit!


				
					Gameplay

Each player blind draws two dice from the bag and places them in his cup and shakes (his secret pocket dice), and they ante and bet based on their pocket dice. Then three more community dice are drawn and rolled (the flop), then a fourth (the turn), and a fifth (the river), with two betting rounds (of check, bet, call, call  raise, fold, and all-in options) in between each draw. Dice combinations are similar to their poker counterparts and can give players; two pair, three of a kind, full house, straight, four of a kind, flush, Yahtzee (five dice of the same number in different suits), straight flush, and the Yahtzee Flush - five dice of the same number and suit (color), that automatically wins a player the game.

Scrabble DASH is the fun, fast-paced word game with cards. Use your letter cards to make a word that can match what the Dash card says and put your cards on the table. It's that simple. But everyone's racing against you to get their word down first so move fast!

Components:

This game is entirely card-based, consisting of 38 vowel cards, 48 consonant cards, and 19 Dash cards.

Gameplay summary:

Each player has a hand of 7 letter cards - initially 5 consonants and 2 vowels, but as the game progresses players can refill their hands freely from the separate vowel and consonant decks to vary the mix.

On each turn, the top Dash card is turned face up, revealing the goal for that turn. Players then race to play a word from their hands to fulfil the Dash card, or skip the turn to discard cards and draw new ones.

The Dash cards include criteria such as number of letters (ranging from 2 to 4), specific parts of speech (verb/proper noun), or specifying that the word has to start, end with, or contain a particular letter, drawn at random from either the vowel or consonant deck (players do not need to play their own copy of this letter from their hand).

The first player to lay down a valid word claims the Dash card, and the first player to collect 5 Dash cards wins the game.

20040,Badaboom,2005,5.19845,194,1.72,3,5,30,30,Thematic,Card Game Fantasy Humor ,,"Badaboom is a humorous card game for 3-5 players. The 30-60 minutes of game play feature loads of explosive action, a high level of player interaction, a non-sequential order of play, fabulous contraptions, numerous chances to stick it to your opponents in nasty ways and stunning graphics from the artists behind Spank the Monkey and Kablamo. The game contains 64 cards, 50 Gold Coin markers, 2 Bomb Armed markers and a rules folder.

The players of Badaboom take on the roles of wretched goblins in penal servitude under the cruel High Necromancer. Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and try reverse engineering, tinkering style, on various explosive contraptions manufactured by their masters enemies. But the task to gain hands-on personal knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime supply of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out, and the only way to succeed with this is to earn the gold coins needed for bribing their greedy guards.

The fundamentals of Badaboom are quite simple, but there are lots of tricks and tactics that add depth. Basically, the players take turns holding and tinkering with the bomb while striving to do three things:
 Remove valuable mechanisms from the bomb.
 Change the nature of the bomb in a way that is favorable to the current player but not necessarily to the others.
 Make damn sure to stay away from the explosion when the bomb goes off.

This may sound straightforward, but things are made complicated by the fact that any player can steal the bomb during other players turns. And its very tempting to steal it. Not only do players get to tinker with the bomb when holding it. They may also draw a card from the deck, and as the deck is placed face up revealing the next card, the players know what they can gain by stealing the bomb. This makes the bomb skip and turn a lot during the game, keeping all players on their toes.

To win, players need to perfect their timing, make every card count and, of course, avoid losing their heads.

Covert Action, which handles 4-18 players, is aimed squarely at the Werewolf crowd. Players are part of a covert team (red, blue, green) that must eliminate one member of an opposing team, but your target is a mystery. At the start of the round, players are randomly dealt a card that depicts one of four characters: sniper, agent, cleaner, mole. The sniper of one team must shoot the sniper of another team to win that round. Problem is, you have to figure out who to shoot without being shot yourself.

As for the other characters, the mole is secretly working for one of the other teams, the agent makes the other team lose if he is shot, and the cleaner must make the shot if the sniper isnt a part of the team. (Two cards are randomly thrown out each round, so a teams sniper might be out of play. The cleaner needs to figure this out by talking with his teammates, but since all discussion is open, they still need to be covert in their talk.) Members of the winning team (or teams, when three teams are in play) receive a score card, and the first player (or players) to receive four cards wins the game. Teams are randomly determined each round, so your back-up man one round may be your target the next. Covert Action sounds utterly simple, yet is difficult to describe succinctly. I look forward to seeing how Frank makes everything clear in the rules.

To start the game, deal each player ten cards. Each player takes five of these cards at random, places them in a + pattern, then turns them face-up; the other five cards form that player's hand. Each card has two of twelve symbols in the upper-left corner.

On a turn, a player replaces one card in his + with a card from his hand, moving the first card into the + of his left-hand opponent in the same location; that opponent discards the card that was in that location. If a player creates a horizontal or vertical line of cards which each feature the same symbol, that player takes a key card showing that symbol. (A player can claim a particular type of key only once.) If all five cards in a player's + show the same symbol, the player can claim any key card that he does not already have.

If the total of a hand's cards exceed 10 points, the tens digit is dropped. The hand with a total closest to 9 wins and neither hand wins in the event of a tie.

Punto Banco is the most common variant in North America, but requires no skill and operates solely on chance. Typically played in Casinos, the house always plays the Banker hand (although players may still bet on that hand to win). It is usually played with eight (8) decks of cards shuffled together.

Conversely, Baccarat Banque and Baccarat Chemin de Fer (more common in Europe) allow the players to make choices during the game so a player's skill can affect the outcome. In either of these variants a player may choose to play the Banker himself and the other players play against his 'Bank' (supply of money). In Baccarat Chemin de Fer, the Bank passes when the Banker looses a hand. In Baccarat Banque, a player may remain the Banker so long as he still has funds or until all cards in the shoe have been dealt. Baccarat Banque is typically played with 3 decks of cards while Baccarat Chemin de Fer is typically played with 6. In most cases these variants are played completely in French even in English-speaking areas.

Since the Banker has a slight edge over the Player in his chances of winning a hand, the house taxes all winning Banker bets when played in a casino (typically 5%).

The game is basically a two player game but it can be modified to accommodate any number of players. Each player manipulates his aircraft on a grid which simulates air space. 255 counters.

This game places two sides in a jet (era) dogfight. Each player starts with 3 planes, chosen from 14 different types available. One side are the 'Intruders'. the other 'Interceptors'. Each turn represents 30 seconds of real time. There are a variety of missions and you may use whichever aircraft you want, so that you can guage the different performance capabilities of each craft. This is an old-fashioned war game and has been superceded by much more realistic (although also much more complicated) games, but if you like the theme and you want a quick, 'fun' game, this is ideal.

116593,UNO Dice Game,2011,5.01556,99,1,2,2,15,15,,Abstract Strategy Dice ,Dice Rolling,"BASIC DESCRIPTION:
The UNO Dice Game attempts to translate the original UNO card game into a two player dice game.  It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.

COMPONENTS:
The game includes 11 dice.  Each die is unique and has some combination of faces in the four UNO colors (yellow, green, blue and red).  The die faces include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, draw one, draw two, and wild (in black).  Note that there are no die faces that represent the Skip or Reverse cards from the original UNO card game (presumably because this is just a 2 player game).

GAMEPLAY:
The game mechanic is simple and mimics the original UNO card game.  To begin, 5 dice are randomly given to each of the two players.  These dice take the place of a players hand of cards in the original UNO card game.  The 11th die is left in the middle of the play area to form the start of the dice line (think UNO discard stack from the original card game).  The starting player rolls their dice and has to match either the color or value of the most recently placed die in the dice line.  That player's matching die is placed in the dice line and will have to be matched by the next player.  Play continues as players take turns rolling their hand of dice and adding one matching die from their hand to the dice line each turn until they only have one die left in their hand.  The player must then say UNO! or be penalized.  The penalty for not remembering to say UNO! is similar to the draw one and draw two die faces:  the affected player must take the appropriate number of dice from the end of the dice line.  The first player with no dice left wins.  The winning player's score is based on the faces of the dice left in front of their opponent.  Alternate rules are provided to ignore scoring and simply play the best out of 3 games.

PACKAGING:
This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label.  The top of the can pops off (twist to open).  The one sheet of rules and 11 dice fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin.  The tin also has a coin slot in the top that holds the a plastic hook to allow it to be hung for selling/display purposes.

On a modular board with moving, turning, and disappearing spaces, players vie for a good board position and a strong hand. On every turn, players draw based on their piece's location, play half their cards, and move. They lose if they run out of cards during their turn or are on a space where they cannot move. The cards' effects vary from useful to nasty, and so playing more cards may be more of a curse than a blessing. As players get eliminated, will you be the only player to not lose?

Created for the 25th anniversary of the character, Mega Man: The Board Game is a 2-6 player board game in which players control both their character and Dr. Wily's forces, ideally to impede the progress of other players. After determining who goes first, players choose the Robot Master's stage on which they wish to start the game. On your turn, flip over the challenge card to reveal your first challenge. You choose the dice you wish to use to pass the challenge, then play cards from your hand and use abilities from your character to blast, jump or run through the challenge. Your opponents can play cards from the Dr. Wily side of their hand to make your challenge more difficult, possibly doing damage or taking lives from you along the way. If you beat the challenge, you move forward on the stage a number of spaces determined by the challenge you defeated.

Once all spaces are clear and you are face-to-face with the Robot Master, you enter the Boss Battle. You and your opponents now take turns battling each other until only one robot remains standing. If you are the victor, you take the Robot Master's powers from the character card, stacking it under your own character card. If you were the first player to defeat this Robot Master, you also gain its Trophy, which allows you to set a die to any face you wish in a future Challenge or Boss Battle.

Play continues around the board until you have defeated enough Robot Masters to enter Dr. Wily's castle and face the final boss. The first player to defeat Dr. Wily wins.

27471,Cálico Electrónico: El juego de cartas,2006,4.24444,45,2,2,4,0,0,,Adventure Card Game Exploration Humor ,Action Point Allowance SystemDice RollingHand ManagementModular BoardRock-Paper-ScissorsVariable Player Powers,"Based on a popular spanish flash animation, Clico Electrnico - El juego de cartas is a dungeon crawler in which the players take the role of Clico Electrnico himself or one of his clones to prove that they are the strongest by completing two episodes.

The mechanics are very similar to Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord. Players are dealt one of the four characters; each one has a power and a charisma value and a special hability. Also, each player receives an episode to complete in a determined city area and three calico cards (action cards). Then, the initial city is built: each player places one city card that matches with the starting one or with one that has been already placed.

Each player in his turn can spend calikillos (action points) to do several things:

    1 Play a card: Each card has different costs and effects
    2 Move to an adjacent city tile: Each tile not only has a different cost, but also, you receive anticalikillos, wich other players will use to play monsters, special effects...
    3 Place a new city tile: Spending one calikillo, you can draw a city tile and place it on a legal spot
    4 Heal yourself: By spending five calikillos, you heal yourself (each character has two status: hurt and unhurt, so by healing you revert to unhurt)




When a player resolves an action, other players may, clockwise, spend that player's anticalikillos to play action cards on him.

If a player at any time in his turn is at the same city tile of a monster, he will fight it. Fights are simple: you choose a characteristic, roll a die and, if the result of the die plus the characteristic is higher than the monsters value, you defeat him, if it's lower you are defeated and turn to hurt status. Players can fight each other, but the characteristic is determined by the player who wins a rock-paper-scissors game.

When all the players complete their turn, a new round begins:

    1 Players can discard cards and draw until they have five
    2 Set their calikillos to five
    3 Set their anticalikillos to zero

Each time you successfully answer a question, you get a piece of your pyramid, provided you answered with the required precision.

The game is supplied with a reticle (map-reader), which provides you with the letter needed if you want to answer with triangular precision.  So you must answer with a number (for hexagonal precision) or a number and a letter (for triangular).  The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).

The rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.  The zone is determined by rolling the rubi like a die, as the zones are inscribed on the rubi piece.

The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.

A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful Sail Ho! dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.

Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful Sail Ho! dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.

The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to Sail Home, thus becoming the winner.

With the Washington Naval Conference and its resulting treaty limitations on ship numbers and tonnages, the battleship went completely over to 2nd generation designs, including all the major conversions, and then the final burst of 3rd generation dreadnoughts.    Meantime, also as a result of the treaty, a now type of warship, the heavy cruiser, came to the fore and began a progress still unfinished in the modern missile cruiser. These events through 1945 are covered by BATTLESHIP.  The game system was designed to reflect the concept of the Immune Zone, around which capital ship design revolved. This zone is roughly represented by the medium range defense value. But since when this value will come into effect is a result of the characteristics of the opposing player's guns, you must conduct your movements to, whenever possible, be in your immune zone while your opponent is being fired on at either long or short range. It is within these margins that damage can be done in safety.  A hint: learn to use escorts. Properly handled they can shape an engagement early by threat of torpedo action.

in illegally obtained commodities (drugs, plutonium, munitions, oil, secrets, diamonds and gold).

As you move around the board, you can buy and sell the commodities as indicated in each city.  All cards cost the same but have varying resale values (some are even worthless).  Complete sets are worth more, and some commodities are worth more than others.

Assassination can be attempted if you land on one of the two Assassination squares, on the same square as your victim, or once per go around the board if you have enough money (500 k$, forfeiting your turn to do so).  Hired Assassins come in three classes (A through C), the cheaper being less proficient in weaponry than the more expensive ones (A: five weapons; C: three weapons).

Assassinations are resolved by drawing an Assassin card and comparing it with a Location card; each location lists permissible weapons --if the assassin isn't proficient with at least one of those, too bad.  If he is, you draw a Weapon card to see if he managed to find/smuggle one of the needed weapons.  Assuming the three cards show a match, the designated weapon(s) lists a number that needs to be matched on the dice.  An assassinated player is eliminated.

To defend, you may offer 1 M$ to the player who ordered the assassination just before the dice are rolled, or you may hire an assassin of your own as a bodyguard.

    Each player chooses one card in hand and places it face down in front of them.
    Each player raises one hand, then (on the command of the current dueling master) points their gun hand at an opponent.
    Each player reveals their card, then they see what happens:


 If you fired at someone with a gun (whether pistol or rifle), any shots aimed at you miss because you were moving when you fired.
 If you fired at someone with a pistol and they are behind a barricade, nothing happens as the barricade stops your shot.
 If you fired at someone with a rifle and they are behind a barricade, the rifle penetrates the barricade and they're hit; they flip their heart card to show a grave marker, indicating that they're out for the rest of the duel.
 If you were behind a barricade, then you're hit or not hit depending on the weapon(s) fired at you.
 If you were reloading and someone fired at you, then you're hit; flip your heart card to show a grave marker as you're out for the remainder of the duel.
 If you were reloading and no one fired at you, take all of your previously played cards back into your hand.

If more than one player still has a heart showing, place the previously played cards aside and start a new shootout as described above. If only one player has a heart, then this player earns $1; after this, everyone takes all their cards in hand and begins a new round of shootouts.

As soon as one player has $5, the game ends and this player wins.

22980,Jeff Foxworthy's You Might Be a Redneck if... Game,2006,3.481,30,1,2,4,30,30,,Humor ,Storytelling,"from the publisher Patch Products

Patch Products was recently granted the rights to produce The You Might be a Redneck If... Game. Everyone's heard of  Jeff Foxworthy and his hilarious Redneck jokes. Now Patch Products brings his humor to the board game shelves.

You're a redneck. Start in your trailer and go through town, collecting redneck things like a bag o' jerky and a hound dog to bring back home. If you're the first redneck to collect everything and return to your trailer, you win.

On each turn you pick from three choices that correctly complete one of Jeff Foxworthys redneck jokes.

Sample Questions:

You might be a Redneck if... you wash your car more often than you wash your _____.
1. hair
2. kids
3. clothes

You might be a Redneck if... your mother doesn't put on _____ to go grocery shopping.
1. makeup
2. shoes
3. a bra

Dumb luck plays a role, too. If you land on a Dumb Luck spot, you must draw a card and may be required to do any of 30 different things, such as give up one of your treasures, or perform a Redneck stunt like hog-calling. A flip of the Redneck coin each time you encounter Dumb Luck decides if you will be the recipient of the Dumb Luck, or if you must force it upon one of your fellow Rednecks.

Jeff Foxworthy's You Might Be a Redneck If... Game is for 2 to 4 players ages 16 and up. (Answers to the clues: kids, shoes.)

Foxworthy is the largest selling comedy-recording artist in history, a multiple Grammy Award nominee and best selling author of 13 books. He starred in The Blue Collar Comedy Tour movie and the follow-up DVD, The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again. He also stars in and executive produces the WB hit television show Blue Collar TV and hosts a weekly country countdown radio show, The Foxworthy Countdown.

The game consists of two separate decks of cards: the Serve Deck and the Play Deck. Each player is dealt ten cards (or seven, when playing doubles) from the Play Deck. Players must use these cards wisely because they can not replenish their hands until the winner of the set is determined.

The serving player reveals the top Serve Deck card to get the game started. An Ace card is an automatic point for the server. Revealing consecutive Fault Cards gives an automatic point to the receiving player. Revealing an In Card means the receiving player may respond with a play from ones hand.

When the game gets going each player may respond with the proper card from ones hand. Failure to or choosing not to respond results in a point for the opponent.

Components:

Play Deck:

45 normal shots (5 cards for each of 9 possible shots)
2 Out

As you know, before our kingdoms, blessed by the gods with the gifts of Seven Virtues, were born, the world was ruled by the Unnamed. It was him, who spread disaster and there was no-one who did not bear wickedness in his heart. Only the First Hero, shielded by an armor, which defended him from the influence of sin, has challenged the Unnamed, defeated him and banished into the Void, which he close using magical seals.

Today the safeguards crumble, and the power of the Unnamed makes its way to our world. Again, people act against each other, their hearts bearing the seeds of wickedness. The Virtues that were our strength are transforming into parodies of themselves. If the heroes will not complete the armor of the First, clothe with it the most worthy of them, and achieve victory over the Unnamed, all shall be lost.

7 is a fantasy board game, in which you will become a hero worthy of legends, gathering his own party of adventurers to win over an ancient evil. You will take part in dangerous quests, working with other heroes to recover the miraculous Armor of Virtues and proving that you are the most worthy of wearing it. You shall accomplish great deeds, as long as you guard yourself from the temptation of excess, which brings with it sin and disaster.

7 offers a unique mechanism of play, joining the aspect of cooperation with an element of rivalry. For the kingdom to survive, you will have to join your forces with other players. Be wary though, as there can be only one victor. You will have to beware of excessive ambition though, as it can unnoticeably cause your strength to falter. 7 opens the gates to a heroic, but dangerous adventure.

Suggestion: Wear protection (e.g. a glove) on your firing hand - the moulded plastic gun trigger will give you a blister.

Game variation: Place two differently coloured sets of toy soldiers on the board - shoot your opponents army while avoiding your own. Use loosely packed LEGO for fortress walls.

Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue is a fast-paced game of cards and intrigue at court, created by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia. Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves.

In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at Kings Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards.

The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand.

The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players.

If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points wins!

Get it before it's cool.  It even has a pretentiously  hipster name, since it only includes one die.

The rules are characteristically evasive but the gist is: there is a six-sided die. Each side of the die represents a category: music, drink, literature, fashion, movies, and food. One player rolls the die and has one minute to declare a factoid concerning the rolled subject. If everyone accepts the factoid as true, then play passes to the left. If someone challenges the factoid, then that player has two minutes to disprove the statement using whatever electronic device is handy. The winner in the challenge scores one point. The winner of the game is declared when that person scores five points. Players will have to provide their own score keeping units and electronic device for research.

The game is the actual throwing of the dice.  There are four holes that the dice can fall through which eliminates them.  When you throw your dice you can use them to knock the opponent's dice into a hole or change their results.  There are also two small areas (representing the Piledriver) that if a die touches allows the opponent to throw a special die to knock another die into a hole or change the results.

The game consists of two deck of cards, each consisting of 10 yellow cards and 30 blue cards, valued 1-10. In addition, 80 victory point chips are included.

Each round is played as follows: the dealer will deal each player three cards. Four cards are played on the table, open. The players now take turns playing cards. On each turn, a player can play exactly one card. A player can use this card to capture a number of cards on the table. Cards can be captured if the sum of those cards is equal to the card played (i.e. you can capture a six and a two by playing an eight). If a player cannot capture any cards, he has to add a card to those open on the table. A player gets one point for capturing all cards on the table.

The round lasts until all players have played their three hand cards. Now, each player receives points: One point for the player who has captured the yellow seven, one point for the player who has captured the most yellow cards and one point for the player who has captured the most cards.

The play continues for a couple of rounds (either six rounds for two or three players, or a number of rounds equal to the number of players if there are four or more players. In the end, the player who has collected the most points wins.

The first player rolls the die and places a peg in the numbered hole that matches the number on the die (if you roll a 4, you place a peg in the corresponding hole) - with the goal being to get rid of all your pegs first.  Holes numbered 1 through 5 are only about 1/4 inch deep, and the pegs stand up in them.  The number 6 hole goes all the way through the lid so that any peg placed in it falls into the box and is out of play.

The player may roll and place a peg for each roll as many times as they wish until rolling a number that is already filled by a peg.  If you roll the number of a hole that is occupied, you must take that peg up into your hand, and your turn ends.

The game proceeds with players taking turns clockwise and ends when one player has run out of pegs.

The core game comes with everything you need and boosters just add more options.  Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.

The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.

334,Advance to Boardwalk,1985,5.34061,605,1.5574,2,4,60,60,Children's Family,Economic ,Area Control / Area InfluenceDice RollingHand ManagementTake That,"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.

There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.

If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.

When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.

Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.

The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinländer, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.

An active player rolls a die which determines both the money wagered on the round and if the round will use pictures, captions, or the player's choice. A card is drawn from the deck for each player, who must then pair it with an opposite card from their hand.

In the voting round, each player has a funny token and a die token with identical backs. Players place a funny token on the funniest pair and a die token on the least funny (players may not vote for themselves). A tie leads to a run-off vote. The tokens are flipped up and the player with the most funny tokens takes the money wagered. The next player then rolls the die for a new round.

When a player loses all their money, the game ends. The player with the most money wins the game.

It is a sister game to Echelons of Fury, which pits players as World War 2 German and American commanders.

Players build up their armies in the form of their own deck of cards, which represent supplies, units (air and land), weapons, equipment, and orders.  The objective is to destroy the enemy headquarters (HQ).  To go on the offensive, deployed units have to be ordered with maneuver cards, which direct the attack along one of three terrain cards between the players.  The defender can freely choose among his deployed units to meet the attackers on that terrain.  The outcome of the resultant combat depends on the influence of the terrain card, the involved units and their attached equipment.  If the attack is not defended against, the attackers inflict damage on the HQ.

The game ends in a victory to the attacker when he or she has inflicted enough damage (typically 20) to their enemy's HQ.

1718,Foreign Exchange,1979,4.29836,61,2.7778,2,4,60,60,,Economic ,Commodity Speculation,"From the back of the box:

At last - a money game for adults!

Be forewarned!  This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.

Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.

A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!

International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.

The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.

Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.

Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).

You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.

From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.

Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a Beginning version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the Intermediate game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the Expert game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.

Includes:
2-piece fold-out game board

Solomon's Temple is a game for two players that is fun and exciting. The game will take you from 1 to 1-1/2 hours to complete. The first player to complete the Temple and play Filling of the Holy of Holies is the winner. However, the game is not that simple. While you are trying to build the Temple, the Israelites continue to fall into Sin. Work must be stopped on the Temple in order to lead the Israelites back into the ways of the LORD. To make matters worse, invasion forces from Babylon are pouring down from the north. They want to destroy the entire city of Jerusalem and wreck the Temple! Do you have what it takes to handle the Israelites' rebellion against God, deal with the Babylonian attacks, and still find time to complete the Temple before your opponent does?

Each of the two players takes the part of the Israelites attempting to complete the Temple while at the same time playing the part of the attacking Babylonians for his opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first player to complete the Temple in its entirety, including all Structure and Furnishing Cards, and finally play the Filling of the Holy of Holies card.

The folding game board loosely depicts the Old City of Jerusalem. Positions for Structure, Priest, Altar, Prophet, other cards, and positions for the Babylonian army pawns are clearly marked.

Each player has a deck of 100 cards from which he draws during the game. Drawing and laying cards are the driving force behind play. Cards are played to build the Temple structure, furnish the Temple, build an Altar, attack your opponent's Temple with Babylonian armies, destroy your opponent's armies, interfere with building using Sin, negating Sin with Burnt Offerings and Scapegoats, and so forth.

A lengthy note from the designer explains much of the history and background of the game design and origin.

89928,Banana Balance,2011,4.41111,63,1.2,2,4,5,5,,Action / Dexterity Animals Children's Game Dice ,Dice Rolling,"The name Banana Balance pretty much tells you everything you need to know about this game: It involves bananas and balancing.

Okay, you probably need to know a bit more than that in order to play, so here it goes: Before the game starts, you assemble the banana tree, add four spiky leaves to the top of the wobbly tree, then place a banana at the tip of each leaf. On a turn, a player rolls the special LEGO die, then:

 On a brown, hangs the monkey on a leaf with a banana, then claims all the bananas from that leaf, taking care not to knock over the tree.
 On a green, adds a new leaf to the tree.
 On a yellow, adds a banana from the stock to any leaf.
 On a green/yellow, does both of the actions above.

Any time you can't do a yellow or green action, you take a monkey action instead. If no bananas are on the tree, you can steal a banana from an opponent. Knock the monkey out of the tree, and you have to return a banana; knock over the tree or unbalance it so it topples, and you have to return all your bananas, ending the game and giving the win to whoever is the best banana baron. Variants include new ways to move the monkey and a suggestion to take monkey actions with your eyes closed.

The first player to spot a difference correctly receives a pony token. The first player to collect four pony tokens wins the game.

Hide  Seek is a simple perception and memory game. It also trains concentration, and if the players are asked to describe the differences in detail it can also broaden vocabulary and aid fluency of speech.

Each part has a number from 1-6 and the roll of a die decides which kind of body part you can take from the pool. The goal is then to complete as many clowns as possible.

Jumbolino is representative of a whole class of children's games where players roll a die and add a puzzle piece to their board for the number on the die roll. Similar to Cootie, except that Cootie requires you to get multiples of some numbers (6 ea. of 6 for the legs, and 2 ea. of 4 and 3 for eyes and antennae).

It's also similar to The Merry Game of Floundering, with some differences. In The Merry Game of Floundering:
1. The Flounders have to be assembled in order. Body part 1 first, two next and so on.
2. All the Flounders are put in the middle at the start.
3. Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the center even if fully assembled.
4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.
5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.
6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the center and if there are none in the center that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.
7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.

Similar to Safari Builders, but Safari Builders is listed as 1-4 players.

This game probably goes way back. Sidney Addy's Glossary of Sheffield Words describes a game in which a number of people sit in a row, or in chairs round a parlor. A lighted taper is handed to the first, who says:

Jack's alive, and likely to live
If he dies in your hand, you've a forfeit to give.

The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay the forfeit.

That was written in 1888.

Apparently later it was played with an actual hot potato. Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.

By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remcos late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was Spudsie, a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered Chip OGrattin. Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out Yahoo!

In it, the players, employees of a huge corporation, compete to avoid promotion and remain competent (by taking more right decisions than wrong ones). At the same time, each tries to force the others into promotion or into deadwood status (which happens by accumulating enough wrong decisions and being found out). The last player still alive and competent is declared the winner.

The game was originally published by Skor-Mor in 1973, but the 1981 AH edition is much easier to find.

Skor-Mor published 3D puzzles and games in clear plastic such as Chess in the Third Dimension and a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe called Trinary. It disappeared in the early 1980s.

Your objective is to capture all your opponents' castles, so that you are the last player remaining in the game.

This game in the Risk family of games is markedly different than the original Risk. The combat mechanism is the same but players receive armies at the end of the turn, not the beginning (the sole exception being playing a Reinforcements card). The game has no territory cards, and one does not get armies based on the total number of individual territories. One gets armies for regions controlled and banners in one's castle only. Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.

The cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy).

The game is packaged very efficiently, in a small clear plastic tube, along with a rules sheet and four small flat tokens. Q-Turn is thus highly portable, and can be played on any flat surface, from the lunch counter to an airline tray table.

The game is played by randomizing the disks and placing them face down on the table in a 4x4 pattern. Tokens are placed at the corners, with the goal being to move your token to the opposite corner and back again before your opponents. As the tokens move across the board, disks are flipped over, revealing arrows that indicate which way a token may move next. Each type of disk allows a different special action, rotating one or all of the disks a quarter turn, thus changing the available paths across the board.

A quarter-turn here, and a quarter-turn there, and soon everyone may be headed off in the wrong direction!

How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point. Of course the winner is the person left when everyone else is a hog.

The players begin the game from their own base and each have control over a Vlad hero as well as an Archer and a Wallachian Knight.

During the game, they try to eliminate the opposing Vlad heroes through tactical movements and attacks with their own units. Gameplay takes place on two boards: the Game Map and the Underworld Map. While the Game Map is the board on which all the interactions between players take place (including movement, battles, tactical actions, and the positioning of units and outposts), the Underworld is the area Archers and Wallachian Knights enter once they die in battle. I Am Vlad: Prince Of Wallachia has two types of battles: against enemy units and against neutral units; for both types, players use battle cards, magic cards, tokens, and an eight-sided die. Other tactical actions are made through tokens, gold coins, outposts, and so on.

3390,Friends,1999,4.31754,57,1.8,4,10,30,30,,Movies / TV / Radio theme Party Game Trivia ,,"This is a game invented by the character Ross in episode 12 of the fourth season of the TV program  Friends. It is the same game as played by the characters on the show and as such does not require any knowledge of the TV series itself.

The players split into two teams - intended to be girls and boys, but this only matters for the bonus questions. Each team takes it in turns to answer yes/no questions about the opposite team in one of four categories:  Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature and It's all Relative. This is done by submitting Yes/No cards face down for simultaneous reveal with the correct answer(s) from the other team. Some questions are about one member of the opposite team - in which case all members of the answering team submit a guess - and some questions are of the style Which of us...?, in which case the answering team collaborates for a yes/no answer for each member of the opposite team. The goal is to answer the most questions correctly about the other team and have the highest points total at the end of the game.

There is also a bonus round - and here the gender divide does matter, because the game is designed so that the boys are asking the girls questions that are supposedly hard for the girls to answer but that the boys themselves should easily know the answer to, and vice versa (no answers are provided for the bonus questions). The bonus round is timed and each team answers as many questions correctly as they can within the time limit.

5285,Pro Tennis,1983,4.16667,54,1.6667,1,0,30,30,,Sports ,,"Pro Tennis simulates tennis matches in the early 1980's, the era of Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Martina Navritolova and Chris Evert. Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for Serve, Serve Return, Volley and Special. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.

To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is I, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a V in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.

Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.

The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.

Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is I. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a V. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is S, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable Special column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.

And so it goes.

This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.

The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.

This huge Milton Bradley box contains an over-sized board with a rather flimsy Visitor Center building; stand up cardboard pieces for the various movie characters, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the more dangerous dinosaurs (a T-Rex, Velociraptors, and Spitters).
You start off at the other end of the island and try to make it to the Visitor Center. There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.

Although the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).

From the box: On Xanth... Anyone who doesn't believe in magic must reckon with the rainbow, which shows up only at a distance and retreats if anyone walks toward it. If one person stands still and another walks, the rainbow remains in place for the one and retreats for the other - simultaneously. It is one-sided, like a one-way path, invisible from the other side. That is obviously magic. - Piers Anthony

Xanth, the magical, pun-filled world of Piers Anthony's fantasy novels, comes to life in this hilarious game. As one of many colorful characters, players must travel across land and sea in order to fulfill their wild and wacky quests. For 1 to 6 players, ages 12 to adult.

Contents: 162 playing cards, 15 dice, 6 pawns, 12 chits, gameboard, rulebook, sorting tray.

There are 3 card types used in the game, Chair Actors (Characters), Events/Encounters  Quests. The majority are E/E cards. Only Character cards have colour illustrations, the others being monochrome or text only. A small errata sheet is included.

Simple  Easy Game
Each player starts with 2 character cards and a Quest card (which determines their starting area on the map), with the character's Cunning  Strength, plus a Talent - an extra rule or exception they can use, tying in to the character in the novels. 
Each turn starts by drawing an Event/Encounter card, playing it if it's a Disaster. Other E/E cards include objects to assist in some way, commonly in combat, hazards to play on other players, additional characters (mixed in from those not in play) etc., often limited by area (you have to get to some areas to activate some objects, for instance). 
If there is no Disaster, players move their pawn across the board (normally 2 areas, Characters, Event cards  the area characteristics can modify this). The other players may then play Events or Creatures on them, possibly limited by the area. Characters can attempt to avoid encounters (roll dice under Cunning), or may fight (roll a die under Strength to cause a wound, repeat until one side loses). The specific encounter or creature may modify this, as can many E/E cards. 
Players start from scratch if their character is beaten, but can heal by use of certain cards or in certain areas. 
The first to complete their Quest wins.

Still Simple  Easy but Longer Game
Same as before, but complete 2 or 3 Quests. This ties in to the 3 Quests set by the Magician Humphrey in the novels.

Monaural (Solo) Game
Same again, but work through the Quests deck until you are knocked out. hazards are drawn randomly instead of played by other players.

Stereo (2-player) Game
Same as the Monaural Game, the winner is the player who completes most Quests

Okay!  it's nothing like playing golf. But it's still a lot of fun!

Golfmania is a wacky, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to complete 18 holes of golf through equal parts luck, strategy, and the sincere desire to see your opponents suffer. It's a game the whole family can enjoy: the rule are simple, the cards are fun and colorful, and you can play it in under 20 minutes.

Here's a quick overview of what the game is like: At the beginning of each turn, a Hole card is drawn. Each Hole card is worth a certain number of hole points if you win it, so you take a swing (i.e., roll the die) and give it your best shot. Everyone   gets a chance to swing, and everyone gets to play cards which affect that swing -- freaky weather, lucky gophers, hi-tech golf equipment and other zany events are sure to change the way you play golf.

Did you win the Hole? Great! You're a few points closer to your winning goal of 18 hole points. If not -- no matter, you'll just have try again on the next Hole card... and get revenge on the opponent who nailed you with that nasty card last turn.

That's the idea behind this quick-thinking team trivia game.  When it's your team's turn, roll the die and move your pawn that many spaces.  You'll then draw a card and you and your teammates will try to name 5 things that fit a category within 30 seconds.  If you can, you get another turn.  If not, it'll be your opponents' turn.

Most of the spaces on the board are solid colors, which determine what category is in play.  For example, if you land on a red space, you play the red category.  However, there are four kinds of special spaces:  All Play (both teams get a different category, and the first team to name 5 things in their category rolls the die and takes the next turn), Flip Flop (teams alternate giving answers until someone can't think of another), Wild (your team gets their choice of the five categories on the card) and Double Down (you have to pick two of the 5 categories and name five things in both those categories, all in 30 seconds).

When you reach the big Name 5 space in the center of the board (which you have to do by exact count), you'll have the chance to win the game.  You and your team will have 90 seconds to name 5 things in each of the 5 categories on the card.

The object of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand.

Each player is also given a number of antique cards, with an item pictured, which will be used to drive the game play.

On each player's turn, an antique card is selected. Each player will then choose a value card from his hand to correspond to the value the player thinks the antique is worth and places it in front of him. Once that is done, the player whose turn it is reads two stories that are printed on the back of the card. One is true, the other false. As the stories are read, if a term is used that is listed on an Antique Speak card held by a player, that player can discard that card as well as any value card that is still in his hand.

After the stories are read, all the players except the one who read the stories will vote on which story they think is true. The true story and actual appraised value are then revealed. All players who guessed the correct value can discard the value card they used for their guess. All players who guessed the correct story can discard any value card, including the one used to guess the value on this turn (if they guessed the value wrong.)

As soon as a player is out of cards at the end of a turn, the game ends.

Back then the 'milkcaps' from the Dairy bottles were used, but thanks to companies like the now nonexistent World POG Federation, the simple game became an overnight fad that spawned an entire industry for years.

The game basically consists of taking a slammer and slamming it down onto a stack of Pogs that are stacked on a mat.  You do this until either your or your opponent's Pogs have all been flipped over.  There are variations to the rules, but these are the basics of it.

The game is simple and rather fun.  POG The Game is a nice packaging of the game, with all the components needed to play it according to World POG Federation rules and with their official merchandise.

You notice that some of the evil of the white lady has contaminated everyone of you; otherwise would you be so frightened of one another?
There can be only one survivor, and it will be the player with the most garlic.

The feature that sets this game apart from other games is also the cause for the most complains among boardgamers used to mechanisms that even out luck and opportunities:
The White Lady moves around the board in a random fashion, only when she comes near a player, that player has the option to act. If the player chooses to repel the vampire that means using up garlic. A player that drove back the White Lady can then decide to move their own pawn, possibly frightening other players' pawns and stealing their garlic.

Successful play does not mean just remembering how many turns the White Lady has left, a much bigger influence is how well a player turned the other players against each other with the help of the Vampire.

        Disambiguation: This game is for the Golden Compass movie, the game for the book is located over here.

    


Players are part of Philip Pullmans creation, as portrayed in the motion picture: a world very much like our own, but existing in a parallel universe. The game features graphics and pictures taken from the movie. Players alternate in leading Lyra in her journey to rescue her friends, as she escapes from the Magisterium's clutches. As each turn unfolds, players collect items and clues, and help Lyra to understand the Alethiometer - the truth-measuring Golden Compass. During a turn a player uses the Alethiometer spindle: the spinning action reveals the two actions the player is allowed to choose from. A typical move involves playing or drawing Lyra cards, played in sets to collect Item tiles from the board (representing Lyra and Pan's actions and investigations) or placing Symbol tokens that will later let a player draw valuable Truth tokens (representing the interpretation of the Alethiometer). Character cards, showing the main heroes and villains of the story, can be used by players to alter the gameplay by applying their special abilities. The winner is the player that scores the most points by the end of the game.

Players control dwarves mining mithril and gems on a randomly assembled tile-based board. After each player's turn, he or she rolls a die and chooses a tile with that number on it at one end of the board for Magdar to destroy. Any dwarves on the destroyed tile are sent back to the cavern entrance and lose anything they were mining at the time. The game ends when one row of tiles has been completely destroyed. Scoring is based upon having a good mix of mithril and gems. Other elements such as claim jumping are added in the advanced version of the game.

Scenes, which are Loony Tune episodes, have a value and color. Actors, which are characters from various cartoons, each also have a value and color. Special effects are the monkey wrenches that may be thrown into the mix for more randomness.

Four scenes are laid out and replenished when depleted. The object is to play Actors to the scenes to try to steal them. The active player plays actors and/or special effects to a scene then the inactive player does the same. After both have played the scene is removed and scored.

To win the scene you must have the best actors. The hierarchy for scoring is...

1. The highest value of same color actors not exceeding the scene value.

2. The highest value of wrong colored actors not exceeding the scene value.

3. The highest value actors exceeding the scene value. These actors are overacting.

...with the active player winning ties.

The game is good for children because of its simplicity but will not keep the interest of veteran game players. The artwork is from Looney Tunes both color and B/W episodes and are laid out nicely on the cards.

You will not know who triumphs until the last roll of the dice.

One player is the Darkness, each other player is a Valiant - all the Valiant players work as a team. The square-gridded board is filled with castles, each containing a treasure.

On a turn, a player rolls 2 dice and can move using either one, the total, or the difference. Moves are in a straight line unless both dice are used, when each can be used in a different direction.

It was most popular about five hundred years ago and was played by Monks in churches as well as on village greens throughout England.

The game is for two players.  One player has nine black playing pieces, the other has nine white playing pieces.  The first player to reduce their opponent to two pieces wins.

In the first stage of the game players take turns placing their pieces on the board, attempting to make a line of three.  Once all the pieces have been placed, players may slide them, still attempting to make a line of three.  Whenever a player makes a line of three, they remove an opponent's piece of his choice.  When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three.  As soon as one player is left with only two pieces, his opponent wins.

Movies  Money 
A game for 2  4 players
Ages 8 and up
Manufactured by Jumbo

Game materials 
Game board
25 miniature screens 
25 movie cards 
6 Golden Suns 
2 special dice 
Play money

Preparation
Place the board on the table. Each player sits on one side of the board. The red, green, yellow or blue strip at the boards edge determines the color each player uses.

A player is chosen to be banker. He distributes to each player 1 million dollars (5 x $10,000; 3 x $50,000; 3 x $100,000; 2 x $250,000). He puts the remaining money beside the board and administers it separately from his own money.

The 25 movie cards are mixed thoroughly and a card is put face down on each board space.

The 25 miniature screens and the 6 Golden Suns are put beside the board.

Everyone throws the numbered die once. The player with the highest result (the star equals 6) begins. The game proceeds after him clockwise.

Play, phase 1 
On his turn, a player throws both dice. The intersection of the column (number-die) and row (letter-die) determines a board space. If the movie card on this space is face down, the player can and should buy this space with this card. He pays $10,000 to the bank and turns the card face up. Now, a miniature screen is put on this space. The player takes a screen from the reserve and puts it on the space so that his color appears through the two gaps in the framework of the screen.

Finally, the acquired movie card is put into the screen, face up.

Play, phase 2
As soon as all 25 movie cards are owned and face up in miniature screens on the board, the second game phase begins. Now movie cards can change hands.

Debts and bankruptcy
If a player must pay a sum and no longer has sufficient cash, he must sell his movie cards and/or Golden Suns. The player chooses what he would like to sell. The bank pays the sums printed on the cards, and Golden Suns fetch the same amount. Sold movie cards are turned face down again, and the screens and Golden Suns go back to the reserve. How-ever, the bank only takes back cards and Golden Suns if a player is insolvent.

A player who cannot settle his debts must declare bankruptcy. He gives all his remaining cash, miniature screens and Golden Suns back to the bank. The movie cards are turned face down again. The player retires from the game. If movie cards are turned face down in the second game phase, the game returns to the first game phase. Therefore, takeovers of movie cards that belong to other players cannot take place.

Negotiations 
All players are allowed to negotiate with other players anytime, even if it is not their turn. Movie cards may be bought, sold or traded. Players can also negotiate in order to pay debts. They need not necessarily sell to the bank if they receive better purchase offers from players.  Players can also negotiate whether owed sums on opponents movie cards can be reduced or even free of charge.

Ending the game
The game is over when only one player remains. He is king of Hollywood!

137336,Archer: The Danger Zone! Board Game,2014,4.82218,133,1.5,2,8,40,40,,Movies / TV / Radio theme ,,"Game description from the publisher:

Channeling the action, adventure and danger that comes with everyday life in the Archer animated series, Archer: The Danger Zone! Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.

Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, come on to another character, or say something that builds up your character's own ego. Naturally you'll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.

The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the Office Map varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location. Surely there will be no name calling when another player beats you to the punch!

Air War: Modern Tactical Air Combat is a unique, ultra-complex simulation of almost every facet of modern aerial combat.  Thirty of the most important aircraft types to emerge since 1952 - from the Soviet Union, United States, Great Britain, France, Israel and other nations - do battle in historical scenarios from the Middle East to Vietnam, from Korea to India-Pakistan, and in various hypothetical scenarios that include World War Three.  The game is played on a geomorphic map across which playing pieces move through a hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in regulating movement.  Probability charts reveal the outcome of various game functions.

Contents: 48-page rules booklet; 16-page booklet of additional rules  scenarios; 72-page chart booklet; 700 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; eight 8-1/2 x 11 soft map sections; and various play aids.

Level of Complexity: Very High
Average Playing Time: 2 hours
Suitability for Solitaire Play: Very Low


(BGG description:)

At one point called the most complicated wargame ever. This modern air combat game has a scale of 1 airplane per counter, 500 feet per hex and 2.5 seconds per turn.

The rule book is 48 pages long with 28 of those being rules. There is a large display for keeping track of each plane (4 per display) with a separate track for throttle, weapons, acceleration, turning at 5% increments, altitude and attitude giving each plane a true xyz position.

Included is a 16 page booklet of 39 charts and tables. There are also individual sheets for each plane with info, charts and tables. There are also individual charts and tables for each type of missile.

The game rightly suggests that you fly an individual plane around at first to learn how a plane operates before adding weapons. The game for all its detail is not without controversy as to realism. The energy rules and the claim that some aspects of the game are based on educated guesses because of the info on some planes being top secret, have caused this feeling of fudging.

All in all one of SPI's most ambitious projects. There is also an expansion - Air War Update Kit.

The winning player is the first person to get around the board by answering the most questions correctly.  They then win by answering all the questions on a card (blue, green, yellow and red question) whilst in the Winning Zone.

The board consists of a long movement track on which the players advance up the political ranks. Sections of the board have number combinations assigned to them (such as 1-2-3, for instance). Players roll a die and move one of their pawns forward to the best possible positions in the next rank ahead of them. Some fields allow for instant promotions or demotions of others, or for additional rolls. Other fields allow a player to add a minister to the current cabinet. The first player to control three ministers becomes chancellor, losing his/her post only when another player has more ministers. If all minister posts are taken, a player placing a minister removes another player's minister and takes his/her place. 
Whenever a player cannot use his/her die result, s/he ages by one year. A player reaching the age of 65 is forced to retire from the game - when all players are retired, the player who holds the office of chancellor is the winner.

3484,Armada,1986,5.21774,310,2.175,2,4,120,120,Family,Exploration Fighting Nautical ,Action Point Allowance System,"A board game with a nicely realized island group, which offers protection for either four nations or four pirate bands (depending on the edition) and indigenous people. Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.

Between the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).

The board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).

Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.

In the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents. Thus you have a large freedom of movement, unfortunately your opponents do also.

1531,Ritter ohne Furcht und Tadel,1998,4.2381,63,1.6364,2,10,45,45,,Dice Fighting Medieval ,Betting/Wagering,"Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.

In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.

Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.

The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).

The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.

Players earn Victory Points in their journey, representing bravery and their dedication to the cause of either Gandalf or Sauron.

 Written and designed by Greg Stolze, with graphics by Samuel Araya, Abuse is easy to learn. Each player aims to destroy the ego (not really, it is only a game!) of the other players, by laying down insults created from cards in one's hand. The objective: get as many of your cards out of your hand before the end of the round (brought on by someone emptying their hand), so as to have as few points as possible. At the end of the game, whoever sinks the lowest (in score as well as insults) wins!

Just to make things even more interesting, there are blank cards (helping you to put your own personal touch on your insults) and snappy retorts, which allow you to turn the tables on someone who's just insulted your mother.

Abuse is a non-collectible card game with eighty cards in a deck, good for four players per each deck in play.

In this game, the players' goal is to clear 10 lines to win the game.  Players keep a grid of 10 cards face up in front of them, flipping them as lines are cleared to keep track of their score.  Each player may hold two cards at a time in their hand.  Cards may feature blocks known as Tetriminos which can be used to clear lines or special action cards that can hinder other players.

A puzzle will be displayed on the top of the draw pile.  To clear a line, players must use the Tetrimino cards in their hands.  If the Tetrimino on a card fits in this puzzle so that it completes a line (or lines) five squares across without any gaps, it can be played to clear a line (or lines).  In order to fulfill this goal, Tetriminos may be rotated.  For each line cleared, a card is flipped in that player's matrix.  If clearing a line is impossible with the player's hand or if no action cards may be played, then the player must discard a card of their choice and draw the top card of the draw pile.  The next player takes their turn and play proceeds until one player has flipped all ten cards in their matrix.

The new Epsilon Edition Starter Deck comes with a bonus Yellow Booster Deck.  This game is played with only 1 copy of the game, so players do NOT need to bring their own decks to the table.

The object: Collect as many Carrots as possible, hoping that one of them is the randomly predetermined Magic Carrot.  In doing so, you must keep your bunnies alive as long as possible, while eliminating your opponents' Bunnies because once all the Carrots have been claimed you must have a living Bunny to win.

The problem: Your opponents are armed with outrageous weapons (from level 1 weapons such as a Kitchen Whisk to level 12 weapons such as the Nuclear Warhead) and you must roll higher than these levels to survive.

Use cards to defend your Bunnies, such as the hilarious Magic Spatula or other special cards, or use a Feed The Bunny card to force your opponent to buy cabbage and water (if they have the money to do so...)

Your opponents, as the back of the box quotes, will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the game, which can get dreadfully vengeful, horribly nasty, hilariously messy, and just plain fun!

The game includes 165 cards (including the Blue Starter Deck and Yellow Booster Deck), 36 small cards, 6 twelve-sided dice,  Instructions.

The Swedish East India Company loaded their ships in Gteborg with Swedish export goods.  These were carried to Cadiz in Spain and there sold in exchange for Spanish silver piastres, the only currency acceptable to the Chinese and South Indian merchants.  From Cadiz the ships sailed east to ports in India and China (invariably Canton in the latter), where they sought to purchase the most profitable goods.  These were carried back to Gteborg and sold at a healthy profit.  (The Company actually supplied most of the Swedish GNP in those days!)  You will reinvest your profits in new cargo to start the Cadiz/Far East cycle again, but you must also buy shares in the Company.

In the Captain Rules, each player gets one or two (depending on the number of players) photon torpedo cards, used to blast asteroid belts which block access to some planets.  Treaties come in two colours, the rarer ones being more valuable.  Random event cards complicate matters slightly.

6614,Finans,1949,5.11629,199,2.25,2,6,60,60,,Economic ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and MoveStock Holding,"An interesting variant on the monopoly theme which introduces stocks and bonds on top of the basic well-known monopoly theme.

There are four mayor differences to monopoly:

1) The Bank
The Bank area (twelve special squares with different possibilities) is now the most crucial place in the game where you buy properties and stocks and get paid dividend of your stocks. Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.

2) Stocks
Stocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.

3) Car
In Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.

4) Bonds
Bonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares. Each bond has a number from 2 to 12 and pays out if the number is rolled using two dices.

The 1998-variant from Brio is a revised version of Finans by Anders Jeppson and Per Leveaux originally designed by Martin Marte. Finans means Finance but is different from Parker Brothers version from 1933.

So far I have only seen this game sold in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland  Norway).

Players go through six phases of life and answer questions about everyday life. There is also a possibility for group therapy with other players and there are going to be some surprising revelations on the way. The player who first achieves a brain lobe from the six different phases of life is the winner.

As in Trivial Pursuit, Therapy is a race to collect six pieces. But pieces are not granted only for correctly answering questions, but also in some multi-player answered questions with some results depending on group consensus.

Tiny psychiatrist couches make for unusual playing pieces.

What's Yours Like? is the new party game from Patch Products where players share side-splitting laughs while coming up with clever, witty and outrageous clues. Descriptions should be truthful, yet clever, so the player in the hot seat doesn't get an easy guess.

In this game, all players except the one in the hot seat look at a guess word and then creatively describe what theirs is like. They might be telling about their swimsuit, neighbor, closet, hair or any of the other 300-plus words in the game. The player in the hot seat then tries to link all the clues together to figure out what is being described. The best part about this game is that the hilarious clues come from people who play the game. The player who guesses his or her word with the fewest number of clues wins.

What do you think players are describing with these clues?

Mine keeps getting bigger.

I compare mine with others.

My wife likes mine.

I never see mine.

I receive mine once a month.

You wouldn't believe what I do for mine.

Mine disappears too fast.
What's Yours Like? is for 4 or more players ages 10 to adult.

(Simply Ingenious: Whoever Risks Too Much Loses!) is a tile game related to the Ingenious board game in that players are once again collecting as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also needing to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well.

To start the game, mix all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) face down, then turn three face up and place them in a shared pool in the center of the table. On a turn, a player flips a tile face up. If the tile doesn't match one of those in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can either end his turn and collect the face-up tiles before him and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn.

If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. (With four players, the goal is five tiles.) Any tiles of a color you collect over seven are shuffled back into the supply.

If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool. If the pool ever has fewer than three face-up tiles, reveal tiles and add them to the pool until three tiles are available.

Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert! was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.

The players try to complete various dangerous quests, which will grant them new items, elixirs, or keys, if they are successful.

The ultimate goal is to find a set of 5 keys, which will open the way to an ancient Temple, which holds a great amount of treasures. However, there is a guardian inside the Temple, which must be defeated, before a player can collect treasure and thus, win the game.

All quests are resolved with dice (which have symbols on them). Players roll the dice in order to acquire the same set of symbols, presented on a quest card.

Its more about creativity and alluding to pop culture (or just regular culture) than it is about math or numbers. It takes about 30 minutes to play a full game, even with an 8 person game.

Players choose a Warrior card (like Medusa or Puss In Boots) from their hand to represent them in battle, then multiple players must work together as a team to defeat the players on the other side of the table. They also use Item cards (like Excalibur or Flying Carpet) to get them out of a tight spot and turn the battle around! Each battle is also set on a Battlefield (like Beanstalk or Sleepy Village) and players can use the terrain to their advantage.

The actual battle is conducted by players describing their character's action to the judge, who has final ruling on all matters. If it convinces the judge, it's fair game! After each battle, the role of the judge passes to the player on the current judge's left.

Each of the game's ten dice are marked with five different symbols - a red circle, a blue square, a red circle with an inscribed S (for Swipe), a blue square with an inscribed S and a black square with an inscribed X. There are two red circles on each die.

Players (from 2-6) begin with two dice, and two red chips. Remaining dice and chips (of which there are a total of 50) are placed in the center of playing space. Youngest player rolls dice and acts according to symbols, as follows:


    Blue Square - take a die from center. 
    Blue Square with inscribed S - take (Swipe) a die from any opposing player. 
    Red circle - take a chip from center. 
    Red circle with inscribed S - take a chip from any opposing player. 
    Black square with inscribed X - lose a die to center


A special rule is the Super Swipe, where all dice rolled end up as a Black X.  In this case, the player gets to take a die from all opposing players and then takes another turn.

Winner is the player with most red chips when center pile of chips is completely depleted.

2356,Scrabble Sentence Cube Game,1971,4.6125,112,1.2222,0,0,10,10,,Dice Word Game ,Dice Rolling,"Players in turn roll the 21 word cubes, set the timer and form sentences with the words appearing on the tops of the cubes in a crossword puzzle-like fashion (one word may be part of two sentences - one running vertically and one running horizontally). Turns end when the egg timer runs out. Players score 50 points for each sentence of 7 words or more. All other sentences score the square of the number of words in the sentence (i.e. a 4-word sentence scores 4 X 4, or 16 points). A bonus of 50 points is awarded if all 21 cubes are used. Two points are deducted for each unused cube.

The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.  From the 1983 rules: When playing a wild cube, a player must state what word it represents, after which it cannot be changed during that turn.

The 1988 version has 24 cubes - two of which are the starred wild dice. The box states that this is the 2nd edition of the game from Coleco Games. Selchow  Righter is credited in the directions as a subsidiary of Coleco Industries, Inc. The majority of the outer box is blue.

Game play

Put the dog in the middle of the table. Each player gets a shovel. The youngest player starts the game by rolling the dice. The symbols on the dice indicate what you should do.

126444,The Hobbit Card Game,2012,5.29621,960,1.4051,2,5,30,30,Family,Card Game Fantasy Novel-based ,Hand ManagementPlayer EliminationTrick-taking,"In The Hobbit Card Game, two teams play against each other: good versus bad. The basic game mechanism is trick-taking, but whoever wins the trick can distribute the cards amongst all the players, depending on his character's ability. Bilbo, for example, must keep one card from the trick, give one card to another player, then discard the remaining cards.

In addition to a special ability, each character has a special affinity with the forces that govern his motives. Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin are scions of good, while Smaug and Bolg are cruel and evil. The cards respond to these alignments accordingly: a white star on the card symbolizes the forces of good; the helm of an orc adorns cards possessed of evil power; and a card with a pipe grants players the ability to draw an extra card in the next round. If a card with the opposite power is assigned to your character (Gandalf gets an orc helmet, or Smaug gets a star), then that character takes a point of damage. If your character is already damaged and is assigned a card with the symbol of their own side (Bilbo gets a star, or Bolg gets an orc helmet), then that character gets a single point of damage healed. Two points of damage eliminates a character from the game, so use the cards you win to knock out your opponents and heal your allies.

The round ends when players have emptied their hands, and the last of the cards that were in play have been assigned to the characters. Players who have taken enough damage are eliminated at this point. Depending of the number of players, if enough good characters have survived, the game continues until the final round. If the evil characters have killed enough of the heroes, then the villains win the day!

Players move their men (meeples, if you will) up sets of stairs hoping to be the first to reach the top of the staircase.  Which staircases you can move up and how much you can move are determined by rolling 8 dice and combining them into pairs.  When one of a player's men reaches the top of a staircase, he gets treasure as well as the option of challenging the Polterdice (ghosts of the former inhabitants of the mansion whom you must capture for additional treasure) for more money.  If he loses the challenge, it goes to the next player on the staircase and so-on until someone wins or everyone loses.  The key mechanic is deciding how to spend your dice rolls on which men in which part of the mansion.

The designers note that the game is inspired by Can't Stop, and is therefore dedicated to Sid Sackson (who died during the production of the title).

The targets to aim for include words of certain lengths (top half of the score pad), whilst the bottom half includes categories such as 2 words, 3 words, all vowels and all consonants to name a few.

1574,Tactics II,1958,5.30331,697,2.05,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Wargame ,Grid Movement,"The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.

TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called units in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).

The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22 x 28 mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.

Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. Over 100 counters in all.

TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.

In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Operação MX-1, was released in Brazil. It is sometimes referred to as Tactics III.

Players choose their speeds on each round secretly, but then must move at that speed, even if other dragons or canyon walls are in the way.

The movement system gives players more maneuverability at lower speeds than at higher, so you cannot turn your dragon on a dime unless you are going very slowly - an important consideration in those hairpin turns!

149156,Castles,2014,3.3587,46,2,2,2,30,30,,Card Game Fighting Medieval Territory Building ,,"In the game of CASTLES, two players compete across the gaming table to build a Kingdom of cards.

As each player takes a turn drawing from the deck, you'll seek to gather the support of Dukes, Counts and Barons while also attracting Champions and Wizards to your Court. As you rise in power, your Nobles acquire Lands and Serfs, you'll add a Wife and Heir to your throne and move slowly toward becoming the most powerful Kingdom in the land. But wait... your opponent works to undo all you've built! You face opposition from his Minions, Magick spells and Armies. You are forced to Wage War with your Generals and Arms to seal your legacy in stone.

In the end, only one CASTLE can prevail!

Fast paced and fun, the game is quick to learn but challenging to play. While a session can be over in as little as 30 minutes, aggressive play and thoughtful strategy will keep you on the edge of your seat in game after game!

Players take turns drawing from a deck of 168 cards. As the game progresses, players may decide to try to Block their opponents next card draw by using the combined values of either Minions/Magick or Champions/Arms. As players gain more cards in their Kingdom, they may decide to wage war with their Army, attempting to destroy their opponents Kingdom while delaying paths to victory.

During the game:
The players will be building their own Kingdoms while attempting to hinder their opponent's progress by waging war or blocking their draws. Striking a balance of building, organizing, blocking and attacking is integral to victory!

During a turn, A player may perform one of five available actions. 
1. Draw a card from the deck
2. Wage war against their opponent by combining the strength of their General, Champion and Arms
3. Use a Wizard card's ability
4. Top off a stack (move one card in any stack to the top of the pile)
5. Move the top card in a stack from one column to another, left or right

After completing an action, the player may opt to block their opponent's draw by combining either their Minion/Magick or Champion/Arms values. Three block conditions can occur based on the opponent's card draw value:
1. Lower value than the block total - drawn card is discarded 
2. Equal value - both the drawn card and all blocking cards are discarded 
3. Higher value - Drawn card is kept. Blocking cards and additional cards (equaling or exceeding the drawn value) are discarded

To Win the Game:
Be the first player to complete their Kingdom, consisting of 18 total cards in a specific arrangement.

14191,¥€$,2004,4.17952,83,1.6364,2,6,30,30,,Economic ,Dice Rolling,"$ (YES) is a new game produced by Armstrong Company and launched in 2004. There are 6 types of commodity spread across the 5 continents and players must control these to satisfy two different winning conditions. So to win, you might need to control two tractors and two factories for one condition, and one commodity in each continent for your second condition. Alternately, the first player to earn 1 million wins.

There are decks of cards; Country (which shows a commodity in a country and a price, e.g. Factories are in Britain and cost 70,000), Yes (good stuff), No (bad stuff), Auftrag (winning conditions). You start with some cash money, a few countries and two Auftrag. For the countries you own, you put the plastic commodity onto your colored disc onto the country. So the player owning Britain puts a factory on one of their discs onto Britain. This way, ownership can be seen and can change.

The game is driven by two dice. The player rolls them, chooses one for itself and the other for the player on the left to use. The dice are marked Buy, Sell, Country, Yes, No, Cash. Buy means you can buy a commodity/country from another player - regardless of whether they want to sell it - at the price on the card. There is also a red die you can roll to gamble on the price, making it higher or lower. Sell means you may sell a Country back to the bank. Country means you draw a Country card and place the commodity on your disc on it. Yes/No means you draw from the appropriate deck and apply the result, e.g. all players get a dividend, or pay a tax, etc. Cash means you move a marker on the board and whoever has that commodity or continent gets a bonus.

Since the game is completely driven by two dice, it is pure chance if a good thing or bad thing happens to a player. Due to the nature of the dice, the cards, and the rules, it is quite possible for the game to end in the first round. ...or it can go on forever.  [See Fluxx.]

A central hub has four king slots and four tabbed slots. Only kings can be played in empty king slots, whereas any card may be played in an empty tabbed slot. To play other cards on top of the cards already present in a slot, they have to be one rank lower and the opposite color (red on black or black on red). A pile can be taken from one slot and added to the pile on another slot if the top card of the pile being moved is one lower than, and the opposite color from, the bottom card of the second pile. The first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand wins the round and all of the chips in the kitty, plus additional chips from the other players for each card remaining in their hands. This can be the game, or you can play until someone collects a set number of chips or all of the chips.

Each game of Wyvern is a struggle for domination of the tabletop Battlefield; your objective is to completely clear your opponent's Battlefield of Dragon and Terrain cards. To accomplish this, you will use your Dragons to attack cards in the enemy's Battlefield. However, your Dragons will not fight for you free of charge. Dragons love gold, so in Wyvern you must pay your Dragons to fight. You start with a bankroll of 25 gold pieces, and you are trying to clear your opponent's Battlefield while spending as little of your gold as possible.

Wyvern, one of the first CCG's after Magic, is played with two decks.  One deck holds your dragons and terrain cards.  The other deck has your treasure cards and action cards.

To set up the game you take the top six cards from your dragon deck and lay them face down in two rows of three cards.  Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.  Each player gets 25 gold (any markers you supply) and draws seven cards from their action deck.  On your turn...


     You draw a card from your action deck.
     Place a treasure or replace a treasure.  You may have up to two treasures per row.
     You may change the position of one or two cards in your grid.
     All players may play action cards one at a time around the table until everyone has played as many as they want.
     You must choose one dragon to attack or replace a dragon or terrain card in your grid with the top card from your dragon deck face down.  A dragon can attack a face up card or a face down card hoping he can beat it.  Dragon numbers are compared and the strongest wins.  A losing dragon or terrain is not replaced and you lose by losing all six positions.
     A second action phase now ensues.
     You must discard down to seven cards.

Sub-title: The War in the Pacific-1932~~1948. As this implies, you are supposed to be able to recreate the various Campaigns ongoing in the time line covered. Some claim that this is a remake of S.P.I.'s War in the Pacific (first edition) although it was more ambitious than that.

The contents consist of the following: 

    '7'-22 by 34 multi-colors Game Mapsheets; 
    2,580 1/2 by 1/2  672 1/2 by 3/4 cardboard game counters; 
    '2'-Rules, Scenarios,  Tables Booklets- (of 64 pages)




NOTE*-there are also Aircraft Characteristics Charts for ALL the participants as well as Aircraft Rosters for them; and '3'-Player Aid Charts. 
NOTE-at least '1'-d10 is required for play and is NOT included.

The smaller counters (1/2 X 1/2) represent: Land Combat Units-ranging in size from Regiments up to Corps levels; Air Strike (Aircraft) Markers; 'Subron'-markers (depicting a 'Fleet'); Merchant Shipping (including Strategic) markers; Fortifications; Airbases; Naval Facilities (Ports); 'Burma Road'-markers; A-Bomb markers; Turn-Record  Initiative markers; Control markers; Damage Level (to apply on the 'Facilities') markers; Fuel Usage markers; Task Force  Effectiveness markers (these are used to 'hide' a Fleet  permit a 'Scout' to reveal them with a probability of 'mis-counting'). Among the smaller counters, there are many colorful and exquisitely detailed Aircraft pieces- (some have the appropriate Camouflage for their side). The larger counters (1/2 X 3/4) represent the Naval vessels for each side from Destroyer Squadrons up to individually named Capitol ships for each respective side. There is even a 'Blimp Carrier'- (with Fighters to launch!) for when they were proposed to be a cheaper replacement for those massive vessels!

This was going to become the New  Improved version of an old classic-and in many respects it WAS! The only problem was that it was so ill-received by the gaming community that they almost WILLED it to fail in order to retain their fond memories of the previously released game on the same subject. The Mapsheet  game counters' GRAPHICS were state of the art at that time. In fact, they were so great that they even offered some New  Improved versions of game counters using that, for a few other games by some of their competitors because they felt that those could use some.

Some of the Scenarios include: 

    '1932'-Mini Campaign-Attack by the I.J.N. on the Panama Canal with an 'Arms Race' as an *Option*-(and including the 'cancelled' vessels for both sides); 
    'Training' Scenarios:
        the Relief of Wake Island
        Battle of the Gilbert Isles; 
    
    Midway; 
    Burma; 
    Philippines Sea; 
    Fantasy Sci-Fi game on The Final Countdown-(the Movie where a Modern Nuclear Carrier is sent back in time to just before Dec. 7th, 1941); 
    entire Pacific Campaign. 




The turns represent a Week's time, there is a method for determining Initiative for one side or the other, and many detailed minutiae for those 'buffs' staunch enough to make their way through this.

Edited to add:  Not sure who the above user was, though from the content I would suspect it was someone involved in publishing this game.  The counters and maps are simply gorgeous and frankly set a new graphic standard for wargames at the time -- and have undoubtedly contributed to the generally better graphics we see in modern games published after this one.  However, stating that the gaming community...almost WILLED it to fail in order to retain their 'fond memories' of the previously released game on the same subject strikes this reader as entirely mendacious and disingenuous in that it completely fails to mention that the rules to this game were so poorly written as to make it unplayable out of the box.  In effect, Fresno Gaming Associates published a very pretty DIY kit that provided the player with world class graphic components and no usable rules whatsoever.  To use the game, you would either need a copy of the previously released game on the same subject's rules or some other set of rules that you might like to try in order to make it work.  For the truly hard-core wargamers among us, that might even be a project of interest, however most customers preferred to spend their money on a game that would actually work without having to design it themselves.  Rumor has it there was a second edition rules set (complete with some replacement countersheets) that was subsequently published, and which supposedly made this thing playable, but at this time I can find no hard information on that.

This devilishly clever two player card game will challenge your strategic interests as you battle for world domination.  The seven cards in your hand are numbered 1 to 9 and include special effect cards that may tweak the rules to your benefit.  Place a card on the continent that brings its value to ten and you control that continent, but beware of giant robots guarding your opponents interests.

Sounds simple but watch out for cards like the Radioactive Randomizer, the Dreaded Duplicator and the Sinister Shuffler.  They might change everything.

1724,Bureaucracy,1981,3.98421,76,2.1667,2,8,90,90,,,,"From the back of the box

Bureaucracy is a somewhat less complicated version of The Great Chain of Being, a medieval, theological, parlor game, first uncovered in a small church in Urbino during the renovation of an ancient, holy, but clearly inadequate, sewage system.  Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, that's a crock.

Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.

Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.

Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.

This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.

Game includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)

First published in Strategy  Tactics magazine #37, Jim Dunnigan transformed the game of Football into a wargame, with limited success.

Played on a hex map football field (6 hexes = 10 yards), players set up their teams and run plays.  Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.

Extensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.  However, no rules are included for kickoffs/punts or Field Goal attempts.

CONTENTS
5 dice, 20 scoring tokens, dice cup, scoreboard, label sheet (for making the dice)

OBJECT
Score the most points by rolling as many of the same Disney characters on the dice as you can.

HOW TO PLAY
The number of players determine how many turns each player takes in a game.
2-players - 5 turns
3-players - 4 turns
4-players - 3 turns

Each player takes the 5 scoring tokens OF THE SAME COLOR.

On each turn, you roll the dice UP TO THREE TIMES, trying to roll as many of the same Disney characters as you can. You roll Yahtzee style ... selecting the dice you wish to re-roll ... and re-rolling up to two times after your first roll. The Mickey Mouse dice icon is wild and can count as any character you wish. The more matching dice of a character you roll, the higher you score. To score, add up the matching dice of that character. Then mark the score by placing its matching token on the score board.

HOW TO SCORE
When you decide to either stop rolling or finish your third roll, you MUST add up your score for that turn. You could have rolled 1-of-a-kind, 2-of-a-kind, 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, or 5-of-a-kind of a character. Always try to score the character with the most matches and place its token of your color on the scoreboard in the proper row and column. If you roll a character match that has already been scored by another player, place your token in the next OPEN scoring space to the left (lower number) of the already-placed token(s). On your third roll, if every character you roll is one that you've already scored, you must score ZERO for that turn. Place any one of your remaining character tokens on its matching face on the score board. Any token placed in this Picture Column score ZERO for that turn.

WINNING THE GAME
After all turns have been taken and scored, players then total up their scores by adding up the Column Numbers above each of their tokens. The player with the highest total wins.

VARIANTS
The Disney edition allows players to select their wild icon at the beginning of their turns, rather than keeping it fixed.

At the beginning of the game, players receive a mission card that tells them how much gold, silver and rum they will need to collect for the game. You keep this a secret from the other players. Successfully completing pirate challenges, searching for booty and attacking other pirate ships are the ways you can get the gold, silver and rum you  need to complete your mission and win the game.
The game, based on the hit movie franchise Pirates of the Caribbean, incorporates clips from the films and takes players to recognizable places such as Tortuga Island and Rum Runners Island. However, this is not a movie trivia game. The movie only serves to enhance the action/adventure game play.

Considered by many to be the issue where Command jumped the shark. Outraged subscribers were appalled when their complaints were dismissed as a bunch of whining by XTR head Ty Bomba.

Apparently intended merely as a small bonus game it ended up carrying the whole load when the planned issue game fell through, it was marred by unusually poor quality control (discolored countersheets.) It is a chess variant with the board expanded to 12 x 12 squares. Follow-up variants in the next two issues of Command added a some interesting variant pieces with new moves and powers and a whole different chess-like game based on 20th Century military units, none of which got the attention it deserved because of the outrage and bad feeling left over from the initial impression. For chess players some interesting ideas, many of which have been seen before in one form or another. For historical board wargamers, it was simply not enough there, and it seemed like a rather pathetic and transparent attempt to cover up XTR's failure to have a suitable alternative to the planned issue game.

EDIT REQUEST:  Does anyone have any information about the game itself?  How it plays, how it differs in strategy and feel from regular chess?  Any information other than how it came to be published?

And from the images, it appears the board is 16x16, rather than 12x12.

Of course, tastes are prone to change (one week it's LARPs, the next it's Computer Games), so players are constantly trying to purchase/trade/auction items so as to reach a certain number of points (items in your obsession count double towards victory). A light-hearted game with loads of gamer/otaku/LARP humor makes this a nice filler game that anyone can play.

A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.

The game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.

So, you and your deceased friends have decided to have a little race around the graveyard.... Thus begins the wackiest game from Twilight Creations yet! The players control their pawns as usual. But: the pawns in this game are self-propelled windup toys!

Players are dealt 8 cards and then draft them by passing first 4, then 3, then 2, and finally 1 to the player to their left. Other players then lead one of their sets and other players must play all their cards for the same action. Whichever player plays the most of that action takes it - if there's a tie, they both take it. The actions include Winding your pawn from 1-4 times, rotating left, rotating right or rotating your opponent.

As players move on the board they encounter hazards, which might make them lose progress and brains. Each time they hit a brain they can take a brain token. Brain tokens allow them to take special actions when discarded.

The game ends when one player manages to cross the finish line and exit the graveyard. There are 4 double-sided boards which allow many different races.

On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck and places it in front of her in a row for cards of that color; some cards are multicolor, and the player chooses in which row to play these cards. After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90. A player can secure only one row each turn.

If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.

If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.

Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.

The world as he knows it is gone, ravaged by a zombie epidemic.

The Walking Dead Board Game is based on the AMC television series, The Walking Dead. The zombie apocalypse is here and the human race is on its last legs. As a survivor, you need to collect all the food, guns, transportation, and allies you can find - but watch out! If any of your fellow survivors get bitten, they'll turn into walkers... and turn against you.

Players take on the role of Rick, Shane, Andrea or one of the other stalwart remnants of humanity as they struggle to survive while learning to live with one another. Innovative gameplay can lead to unexpected alliances, as every man for himself blends with cooperative play and players race to get back to camp alive. Ever-dwindling resources make every decision life or death ... and as the supplies run out, the tension ramps up in this post-apocalyptic world.

You can play as Survivors and Walkers! Create unexpected alliances to get back to camp alive, blasting zombies with shotguns or crossbows  or stalk your former friends as a risen corpse.

This easy-to-learn game includes two scenarios: Survival Mode and Team Game.

7720,The Prince: The Struggle of House Borgia,2003,4.95277,253,2.3636,3,5,90,90,Strategy,Card Game Political Renaissance ,Auction/Bidding,"From the publisher's web page:

Relive the struggle of Renaissance Italy

Intrigue, warfare and betrayal was the order of the day among the Renaissance Papal States of Italy. Cesare Borgia has long been considered the model of the Renaissance noble, the prototype of Niccolo Machiavelli's Prince-intelligent, cruel, treacherous, and ruthlessly opportunistic.

It is the XV-XVIth century, and you, the player, represent one of the great, powerful Italian families-the della Rovere, Colonna, de Medici, Orsini, or the newly-arrived Spanish house of Borgia. Your goal is to attain the one position that will guarantee you, and your family, fame, wealth and power: The Papacy.

The Prince is a game of making the best of available resources. Using the members of your family who are cardinals, Papal offices, strongholds in the patrimony of St. Peter, alliances with other families, and even patronage of the remarkable artists who lived at that time, players jostle for position and political leverage until the time comes for the Elector Cardinals to go into their enclave and vote for a new Pope.

Accommodating 3 to 5 players, this strategic cardgame brings to life the political intrigue of early Renaissance Italy. Relive the treachery, deceit, and war of Cesare Borgia and the other leaders that surrounded him.

Each of the pirates start in their own port with a few doubloons and jewels of their own color. The rest of that color of jewel are piled near their port and the remaining doubloons are piled on Dread Island in the center of the map, along with the fate cards that are drawn when sailing through specific marked areas of the board. It is these pirates goal to sail to the other ports and either raid or trade for jewels of the other colors. Once a pirate has at least one jewel of each color they can land on that Dread Island and collect some free doubloons. Skirmishescan be had with other pirates at sea and may slow the journey, but the reward of treasure can be great. Once all the jewels are gone from the original piles in the home ports (some will accumulate on Dread Island), the game is over and everyone counts the swag in their pouch.

The Signature Edition of this game is packaged in a wooden treasure chest and includes a board in the form of an aged treasure map, three knuckle bones (dice), four treasure sacks, four die cast metal ships, one wind cube, forty-eight Dread Pirate cards, four map cards, fifty replica doubloons, 120 treasure jewels, rulebook, and captains log.

You and your friends are suddenly surrounded by hordes of very aggressive zombies. But do not fret as we have some good news  one of you will definitely get out alive. How can you become that lucky person? It's simple! As the old saw goes, you don't have to outrun the zombies; you just need to outrun your friends.

At the start of Zombie! Run for Your Lives! each player receives four cards from the deck; cards are one of two types: a zombie (which come in different varieties) or a potentially helpful item that can protect you from those aforementioned zombies. The different types of zombies and the items that affect them are color-coded and bear identical symbols for easy recognition.

On a turn, you draw a card from the deck, then play a card from your hand, sending a zombie after one of the other players or using an item to help yourself; if the item matches a zombie card in front of you, both cards are discarded. A player cannot have identical items or zombies in front of him. If you ever have five zombies in front of you, you've succumbed to the horde and become a zombie yourself. As a result, your mental abilities are extremely limited, which means that on your turn, you simply draw the top card and play it on a living player, getting revenge against whoever killed you or perhaps aiding the player you care for the most.

If, on the other hand, you collect five items in front of yourself, you've proved yourself invulnerable to zombies and instantly win!

1647,Spammers,1998,4.16362,105,2.1429,2,6,90,90,,Card Game ,,"FROM the SESSION REPORT:

Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.

Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.

You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less = the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.

Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.

The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.

A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.

To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.

Clearly distinguished from the 1963 game of the same name, by the tag 'exciting NEW game play and easier set up', this is in fact an entirely new game, despite sharing title, theme, design and publisher with the original Mouse Trap.

In 'New' Mouse Trap, 2-4 players race round a track collecting wedges of cheese from 3 traps (constructed during set-up but very much rendered in the Heath-Robinson/Rube Goldberg style of the the original).

Whenever cheese is collected from a trap, or at certain other times, the toilet in the center is flushed. This releases a ball which will trigger one of the three traps at random. Trapped mice lose a wedge of cheese. The first player to gather 8 wedges (a full circle) is the winner.

Given time this new game may become as much of a kids favorite as the original.

Players represent the Chief Operations and Marketing Officers of major American airlines, whose job is to fly the most passengers over a given period of time.

There are two basic games in Airlines: the One-Year Quick Game which takes about 45 minutes to play and the Three-Year Game, which takes about two hours to play. The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call crashes.)

Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.

Once a country has military fortifications installed, it is immune from all further actions.  Unfortunately for the warmongers, world opinion is constantly being lowered by hostile actions, and propaganda efforts must be maintained to keep world opinion high enough for successful actions.

In this card-driven cooperative game, the players together guide the courageous but gravely outnumbered Spartan army against a superior force - the invading Persians.

The Spartans decide to meet the enemy at the Thermopyles pass and try to withstand their attack there. At their disposal are only 300 brave Spartan soldiers and a number of other Greeks supporting them. Choosing when to put their strongest units into battle is essential, as is knowing when to make a stand and when to consolidate their strength.

By playing cards that collectively surpass the strength of the Persian unit that is in front of them at any given point, they defeat it. The players win or lose together, depending on if the Persian army withdraws, or if their last stand fails.

1613,Which Witch?,1970,5.20316,589,1.127,2,4,45,45,Children's,Action / Dexterity Children's Game Horror ,Area MovementRoll / Spin and Move,"Classic three dimensional haunted house race game from the seventies. Players move their pawns around the board trying to be the first to escape the house. Along the way players draw cards that either: a) turn you into a mouse (can't move), b) turn you back into a child if you are a mouse, or c) have you drop the whammy ball down the chimney. The whammy ball comes out in one of the four quadrants of the game board and makes something move (witch's broom, secret door, etc.). If a player's pawn (or mouse) is hit by the ball or moving object it is sent backwards to a safe spot. Ages 6 - 12.

Which Witch came out in two editions: a large box version in 1970 with an unfolded board, and a narrow box edition in 1971 with a folding board.

Finnish version known as Kummituslinna did not use cards for events but came with wheel you spin around. Kummituslinna had high quality plastic tower and staircase instead of cardboard.

Italian version of the game was published by MB and it was called Brivido!. It came with a plastic central tower and a phosphorescent skull instead of the ball. Also, the plastic scared guy markers glow in the dark and the cards are replaced with a spinner (the Greek version also came with the glowing skull and the spinner).

Hungarian version of the game is known as Szellemkastly and also came with a plastic central tower, a wheel instead of cards and a skull which glows in the dark.

The UK version of the game, called Ghost Castle, also featured the black plastic central tower, glow-in-the-dark skull, and spinner.

2482,Zaxxon,1982,4.12277,103,1.2,2,2,30,30,Children's,Aviation / Flight Children's Game Fighting Science Fiction Video Game Theme ,Roll / Spin and Move,"The galaxy is in peril! The evil robot Zaxxon and its legion of followers have conquered an asteroid belt! It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.
Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradleys numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: 
1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. 
2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. 
3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination
4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can fly at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.

HOW TO WIN THE GAME: 
Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.

Each round a mission card is read, including winning criteria (see below). Each player then secretly commits a ship card to it from their hand of five.  The winner of the round is the player whose ship best meets the mission's criteria.

Ships are rated for Space Combat, Marines, Diplomacy, Science, and Cargo.  Most missions will only use one of these (i.e., highest Space Combat wins) while some use two combined (i.e., highest total of Science and Cargo wins).  A few missions add special conditions; ships sent to defend against Gorn attack may not be Gorn, for example, while the Romulan Civil War excludes all but Romulans, and negotiations with alien pacifists go to the highest Diplomacy after Space Combat and Marines are subtracted.

From the rule sheet cover:

Star Fleet Missions is a card game played with two decks of cards:  Ship Cards and Missions Cards.

Each Ship Card represents a starship.  there are 18 cards for each of six races (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Gorn, Tholian, and Orion Pirate), for a total of 108.  (Race means nation or empire.)

Each Ship Card shows the class (type of ship), the name of the specific ship, and five Ratings which are used to determine the suitability of a ship for a given Mission.  These Ratings vary from 1 to 16.

The other two Ship Cards represent starships with Legendary Captains and are the most powerful Ship Cards in the game.  All five Ratings are 20!

Each Mission Card describes an exciting mission on which you will send one or more starships.  Each Mission Card describes the Mission, tells how many ships to send on the Mission, provides any special instructions, and describes how to win that Mission (i.e., which Ratings of the ships sent will be used to determine which ship performed the best.)

A game that is a combination of the two games known as Poker and Keno (or Lotto), with features that make it more interesting and exciting than either.

Each player, except the dealer, is given a board and some counters. If there are no more players than boards, the dealer may also play if desired. The dealer or caller is furnished with an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards, shuffles them, and turns over the top one calling it out. Each player with that space on their board covers it with a counter. The dealer continues turning over cards until someone wins by having a complete row of five scored, either horizontally or vertically. The player who wins becomes the next dealer.

Several scoring methods are suggested, such as collecting all counters lying on other boards. Or, continue playing until everyone has a line of five, then scoring via the rank of poker hands - the boards are arranged so that each line vertically and horizontally represents every different poker hand, ranging from a straight flush to a pair.

 - When players put down cards of the same rank, instead of having a war right away, they cooperate and by trading decks, then have a war.
 - The first player to get rid of all his/her cards wins.

In the common version of the game, players roll the dice to move their caps around the board.  If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his or her cap on top of the stack.  A player then seeks to return that stack of caps to home-base to keep them.  The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board.  In one version of the game, the winner is the player who captured the most caps of other colors during the course of the game.  In the other version of the game, the player who has active caps left on the board is the winner.

According to Miscellaneous Game Book this was first published in 1927 by Otto Maier Verlag.  It led to many copycats, including two from Spears.

You must be vigilant and find your allies before your enemies can unite against them or you.

Players control coloured pawns that represent characters from early in the Buffy TV series, both good (Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia) and evil (The Master, Drusilla, and Spike). The twist is, no-one knows which pawn you control, or which character it represents. At the start of the game each player is given a colour card and a character card, kept secret from the other players. Unowned colours and characters are still in play, not controlled by any player. Each turn players can choose to move any pawn they wish, not just the colour they control. When you move a pawn into a space that's already occupied, you may choose one player (or unowned group of colour and character cards) and ask to see their colour. If that colour pawn is present in the space you just moved to, you may ask to see their character card. You cannot reveal this information to the other players. Once this phase is complete, anyone who controls a pawn in that same space may reveal their colour and character cards to everyone and start a fight. The losing side has to drop a character involved in the combat (and the associated player, if any) from the game. Play continues until it's established that all remaining players are on the same side.

Same theme and nearly identical name, but a different game from Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game.

Each tile has two sides, and each side contains at most one road, one river, and one rail. You can only play a new tile adjacent to a played tile if the sides match. The act of playing tiles creates a map of an intricate twisting transportation network. The tile illustrations are very pleasing to both young and old alike. Only two of the tiles are branching, so the game is mostly played at both ends of the tiles already laid down.

Several variants are supplied in the rules. You can play this game competitively like Dominoes, or cooperatively like a free-form jigsaw puzzle.

First, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing destiny) and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 counters worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also effect cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.

Phase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of battle card, weapon card, character card.  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of power dots (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the die in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.

The final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.

If after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also surrender the planet.

You win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.

There are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.  The artwork on the cards is up to Deciphers usual very high standards.

Its recorded history dates back to 16th century France, and the name has become a catchphrase for many different pantomime games. Many boxed versions with suggestions and timers are available, and several TV shows have been made using the basic idea of the game.

In most versions, one player silently acts out a title (book, movie, show, etc.), phrase or person and their team must guess it. The words can be from a commercially made list or just creatively made up by the players. Many signals and conventions have become traditional (see link below). The experience is usually humorous, whether you are strenuously flapping away like a buzzard - alternating with pretending to push a buzzer and lying dead on the floor - for several minutes while your team guesses everything but buzzard (bird! scavenger! bird of prey!! raptor?) or frantically struggling to think up clever clues. Many of the clues use the sounds like hint - pretending to sew for the word so, for example. The excitement and frustration of piecing together the clues and guessing is also a great part of the fun, of course, and the relief is immense for both the actor and the guessing team when the guess is finally (or miraculously suddenly) correct. The game usually produces much laughter in the group playing it - solving the riddles is only part of the experience.

When all sets have been melded, most points wins.

From The Card Games Website
This is Go Fish without the stock pile. All the cards are dealt out as equally as possible to the players. A turn consists of asking a player for a rank (or a specific card if you play that version). If they have it your turn continues; if not the turn passes to the player you asked. As in Go Fish, you must have a card of the rank you asked for. Books of 4 cards are discarded. The game continues until all the cards are formed into books, and whoever gets most books wins - or you can score one point per book and play to a target score.

This game is often paired in the same deck with Top Trumps

Happy Families - An even earlier (1851), British version with the educational theme centered on family members and their occupations.

Quartet - This is the German equivalent of Happy Families or Authors. Many different designs of cards were made for this game in the late nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, with various educational or other themes.

Now the king has died, and his heir, King Tyrial II, has decided to dispatch his finest lords to raise the fallen city and stand ground against all its enemies, within and outside the city walls.

In Fallen City of Karez, each player will take the role of a lord of one of the guilds who seek to tighten their grasp on the rising city. The players will strive to maintain a balance between keeping the city safe for its citizens by sending exploration parties to defeat any threats, and at the same time attracting to the emerging city new adventurers wishing to fill their pockets with fortunes and their names with glory.

In the action phase at the start of each of the eight turns, players can assign two citizens or one adventurer to act on their behalf in the various buildings of Karez, send an exploration party to remove any threats that lurk near Karez, or buy new equipment to reinforce their parties of heroes. Some guild houses may choose to erect their own private Dungeons (!) in an attempt to inflict havoc and dismay on the other houses. After everyone performs their actions, the players must check how these actions affected migration to Karez; the results of this phase will reflect on the growth of Karez towards a city state, which is the common aspiration of all players.

Players start with different initial possessions and owned buildings. In addition to the common goal of raising the city, each house also has some unique goals (ambitions), which will eventually determine the sole winner. That said, the game is semi-cooperative in that while each guild has its own ambitions, all players must succeed in raising the city by the end of the game or else everyone loses.

The initial setup is the outer ring of the board. Each tile is two rings and the tiles are numbered. Players take turns placing 3 of their player tokens on the tile of their choice.  Each tile corresponds to one of four resources.

At the beginning of each player's turn, two dice are rolled.  A 7 brings a demon into play in a corner of that player's choice.  Any other number will result in some players gaining resources. Rolling doubles gives your regular allotment of resources, plus a resource of your choice.  Rolling 2 or 12 allows you to place a marker on one tile that either doubles or eliminates production for that tile.

Players can use their resources to bring out new player tokens, buy new tiles for inner circles of hell, move themselves, descend deeper into hell, move others, flip tiles, or alter die rolls.  Players can trade resources with other players during their turn.  The lower circles of hell generate more resources (2 for 3/4, 3 for 5/6 and 4 for 7/8).

The game ends when a player descends to the ninth level and defeats Lucifer by rolling a 10 or better on two dice.

You and your friends are honest, hard working taffy pulling machines working in Devil Bunny's taffy factory.  Devil Bunny hates the Earth, for reasons best left known to people who bother to think about such things, and has decided to have his revenge by releasing upon this world the most unsatisfying brand of saltwater taffy known to man.  You and your friends have devised a way to stop him, however.  By luring cute and cuddly little squirrels into the factory and getting them to gum up your works (presumably doing unpleasant things to the squirrel, too) you think you might be able to break yourself, thus foiling Devil Bunny's plot.  Sure, it's a half baked idea, but you're taffy pulling machines, not scientists.  Besides, Devil Bunny's plot isn't likely to succeed anyway.

The game focuses on distribution of tokens (representing squirrels) in a linear fashion eventually leading to your machine.  However, on certain rolls of the dice, Devil Bunny will come out onto the board and repair (remove tokens from) a machine.  Wacky, fun, quick.

11415,Warriors,2004,5.02526,543,1.4082,2,4,30,30,Wargames,Card Game Dice Fantasy Fighting ,Dice RollingSet CollectionTake That,"Warriors is a card and dice-rolling game with a fantasy military theme. Each player begins with a randomly dealt army of 11 units. Most will be creatures of one of the game's 6 types (Barbarians, Goblins, Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Undead). A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).

Armies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One (Battle) allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' natural enemy.) The other type of Attack Card (Mercenary Army) allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.

The resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.

Players gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.

The haunted house is made up by randomly laying out tiles in a 6x6 square making up the floor plan and then adding entrance and exit tiles at opposing edges.

Each player then gets a set of cards symbolizing different actions. Each turn consists of two phases: a planned phase and a random phase. During the planned phase each player secretly select a sequence of cards that define that player's actions that turn (somewhat reminiscent of Robo Rally). After finishing that turn,  the random turn follows where a number of random cards are drawn and executed, throwing the players off track from their plans. During the random phase, a few cards are inserted into each player's card set that cannot be chosen during the planned phase. Apart from normal move cards, there are also special action cards that may for instance move the exit or things like that.

Publisher's blurb

The Haunting House is a wildly fun, fast paced, strategy boardgame with a twist. The object is simple, players enter the front door and race to be the first to reach the exit. It's not as easy as it sounds. Half the time the players choose their own path. The other half their paths are chosen randomly by opponents. Additionally, the board elements constantly change as the game progresses.

The Haunting House features 38 tiles that make up the board, 60 cards and six custom-sculpted pawns.

The whole game takes place in a nightclub and the game board is the dance floor. On their turn players push three new dancers to the dance floor from their own bar counter (edge of the game board) and as they come into play they push others towards the center of the dance floor. Once two dancers meet in the heat of the night they can be made into couples and the better the match the more players score. If only two of the four visible qualities match then the dancers have a one-night-stand which is not a very long term fun and is thus worth only one point. With three matching qualities the dancers actually like one another, start dating and that is worth four points. If all the four visible qualities match then the dancers get the happily ever after the one true love we all search for and thus it is worth full 5 points.

Each dancer also has a secret quality that can and will alter the basic score. For example if a guy has a large... personality then the player gets two extra points unless the other dancer is drunk, because if she is she wouldn't notice the difference. Girl's beautiful roommate on the other hand only has a function in the one-night-stands and the fun the couple would have means now triple fun and thus the player gets triple points. There are 12 different secret qualities in the game ranging from heart-broken to those who still live with their mom.

Occasionally the game gets spiced up by one of the three special charachters in the game. Bouncer can remove any of the dancer from the game board where as a Rock Star walks into the game normally, but once (s)he has gathered a fan crowd and he's completely surrounded player can take the Rock Star and four adjacent dancers back to his hotel room and form two couples out of them. The bully is the guy who harasses women and picks a fight with men and once he enters the game his mere presence prevents any dancer next to him to be part of a couple.

In the end the player who has been the best cupido wins the game. In other words the best scorer wins.

Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.

The board has two tracks: A Rat Race small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a Fast Track where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.

The heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.

With each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.

The game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.

There are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.

1932,Anti-Monopoly II,1977,3.87678,149,1.4706,2,6,120,120,Family,Economic ,Roll / Spin and MoveSet Collection,"In this game the players follow either the rules for monopolists or those for competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!

The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).

Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!

The game was first published as Choice because Anspach was forbidden to use the word Monopoly by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to Anti-Monopoly II. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the II from the name of the latter game.

The pigs are actual pig miniatures, with a dot on their right flanks.

The object is to be the first to score 100 points using pigs as dice. On your turn, you throw the pigs and hope they end up in a scoring position such as a snouter, trotter, or leaning jowler (ranging in value from 1 to 60 points); if they do, you decide whether to cash the points (pass the pigs to the next player) or to roll again. If you roll a non-scorer (pig out - one pig on the right flank, the other on the left flank; a fairly frequent result), you lose any as-yet-uncashed points. If you throw an oinker (both pigs touching each other), you lose your entire accumulated score. If you throw a piggyback (one pig on top of the other), you're altogether eliminated!

The variant Hog Call rules allow the other players to risk predicting the outcome of the throw; if predicted successfully, the hog caller earns twice the value of the position *and* deducts that same amount from the roller's score!

Schweinerei, the German edition, was released by Milton Bradley in 1984; Milton Bradley in 1996; Winning Moves Games (USA) Deutschland in 2001.

The game features a roll-and-move style of movement around the board, success relying on having your marker stopping on the good spaces so you get crop markers that you can sell later on. Farms and forests are bought and sold by the money you earn from the events and crops.

Though being an absolute classic in Sweden, and one of the flagships for the game publisher Alga, very little is known of this game's origin. It has seen at least four graphically major remakes since the first version. It's rumoured to be as old as the 40s, at least we know that the game existed in 1953.

There is a national Marbles tournament that's been held in Wildwood, New Jersey every year since 1922.  To participate in the national you must first compete in a local tournament.

The British World Marbles Championship, run by the British Marble Control Board, has been held every Good Friday in Tinsley Green, England, since at least the 1600's. It often hosts teams from other countries.

All the marbles are placed inside a circle drawn in the dirt. The object is to get all of them out. Take turns propelling your shooter marble from the circle's edge at the marbles in the middle. When the marbles are all outside of the circle, you count up the ones you have put there. The winner is the one with the most marbles. Some play that this person takes all the marbles.

To play, deal the deck out as evenly as possible, then set any remaining cards aside. One by one, each player takes the top card of her deck and flips it onto a central pile. Under certain conditions, players race to slap the pile  creating a slamwich, if you will  and typically whoever is first to do so claims all of the cards in the pile. These conditions are:


    If the flipped card is identical to the card directly underneath it (a double decker), slap the pile.
    If two identical cards have exactly one card in between them (a slamwich), slap the pile.
    If a thief is placed on top of the cards, slap the pile.
    If a muncher is revealed, the next player flips as many cards as the number on the muncher card. If she fails to turn over a muncher card, the previous player claims all of the cards; if she creates a slamwich or double decker, or she plays a thief, then everyone races to slap the pile.


If a player runs out of cards, she's out of the game. Whoever collects all of the cards wins.

They place their selected hero on their left to begin their Hero stack and start their Villian stack on their right.

When the values of a player's hero and villian stack are both 10 points greater than their opposing stacks, he or she calls out Last chance!  The game ends in victory for the player at this point if the opponent is unable to reduce the deficit by playing a card.

Initially all the levers are in the 'up' position.

The first player rolls two dice.  He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:

One number which is the combined value of both dice.

Or...

Two numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.

For example:

If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.

The player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8  9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)

The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4,  6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.

There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to shut the box you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.

In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game.  He or she is the winner.

If any player knocks down ALL the levers in his or her turn, and thus 'shuts the box', they are automatically declared the winner!

Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.

The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are pie spaces, and from these there are spokes of track leading to the middle of the board.

Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.

Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.

The American writer Howard R. Garis (1872-1961) created the character Uncle Wiggily Longears for a children's book in 1910. According to Whitehill, the game based on the children's story was first introduced by the Milton Bradley Company in 1916. Bradley modified the game in 1923, 1949, and 1955. Whitehill states that Parker Brothers obtained the rights to Uncle Wiggily in 1967. However, in 1989 both Milton Bradley Co. and Parker Brothers reintroduced different version of the same game. Hasbro now owns both the Parker and Bradley rights, but apparently is producing the Bradley version for the current market. The game is of the racing variety in the style of the European Goose Game, that is the first player to reach the end of the track wins.

Number of players: Two to eight, each for himself.
The Deck: Standard 52 card pack.

The Deal: Any player is able to deal first. Just shuffle and deal out cards, one at a time to each player in rotation until all have been used. The cards need not come out even. Each player squares up his hand into a neat pile in front of him without looking at the cards which are face down.

Object of the game: To win all the cards by being the first to slap each jack as it is played to the center.

The play. Each player in turn, starting from the dealer's left, is required to lift one card from the pile in front of him and place it face up in the center of the table. The players must turn up the card away from him and not toward him; he must not see it earlier than any other player. At the same time, the play should be made with a swift movement so the other players may not see the denomination of the card before he does.

If the card played to the center is a jack, the first player must slap his hand down on it, take it, and with it, all cards below it in the center of the table. The player who wins these cards must turn them face down and shuffle them with the cards in his hand still remaining on the table in front of him, in order to form a new hand.
Suppose more than one player slaps at a jack. The one whose hand is lowest (directly on top of the jack) is declared winner of the pile. If a player has no more cards left, he remains in the game until a jack is next turned, and he may then slap at the jack in an effort to get a new hand. Should he fail to win, the player is declared out of the game. The play continues until one player possesses all the cards. That player is then made the winner! NOTE: If a dealer's card is exposed, then all the cards must be shuffled before they are again placed face down. If a player slaps at any card in the center other than a Jack, he is required to give one card, face down, to the player of that card.

Ker Plunk is the game where you take your pick and pull a stick. If all the marbles fall, you lose it all! You're only sunk if they go...Ker Plunk!

This classic game of skill can be learned in seconds, but it offers a fun test of hand-eye coordination that is challenging to people of all ages and skill levels. As a result, Ker Plunk was a popular favorite among skill-game enthusiasts throughout the 1960s and '70s.

The game consists of a clear plastic tube, 30 thin sticks, and 32 marbles. Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles sitting on top fall through. If any marbles fall through, the person who made them fall collects them. Once the last marble has fallen, players count their collected marbles, and the player with the fewest marbles wins the game.

Ker Plunk was first published by the Ideal Toy Company in 1967, then later by Mattel and finally by Tyco in 1991. Mattel also published a variant of this game called Super Ker-Plunk!

677,Would You Rather...?,1998,4.41098,519,1.225,3,8,20,20,,Party Game ,Voting,"Before they can roll and move, players must pick a card and present the rest of the players with a nasty choice between two thoroughly unpleasant hypotheticals in categories such as pain, embarrassment, ethics, and ingestion. If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit? The answer neither is NEVER allowed.

Variant:
The 2003 version of this game Would You Rather? appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.

Typical questions include Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?

Every so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.

Designed in 1949 by then 19 years old Kari Mannerla and published two years later in 1951, it has sold over 3.5 million copies since, half of them in Finland. There's one in almost every home in Finland.

Players start in either Cairo or Tangier and start exploring Africa, trying to find gems. The main objective is to find the legendary giant diamond, Star of Africa. However, when flipping the tokens, players cannot know what they will find: nothing at all, some lesser gemstones or even a robber stealing their money and slowing their progress.

When someone finds the Star of Africa, a race begins. The player with the diamond tries to deliver it back to Cairo or Tangier, other players try to find a horseshoe - a token discarded with no value before, now a key to victory. Winner is the player who reaches Cairo or Tangier first, carrying either the diamond or a horseshoe.

A rules amendment, which prevents a player being stuck on an island and effectively out of the game, was only added in 2005.

The first official expansion, Afrikan tähti: Retkikunnat, was published in 2014. This could be a record - a game being expanded for the first time, by the rights holder, 63 years after it was first published.

A player draws a card, and reads one of the facts about the word (they may choose). Then the other player gets to make one free guess. If they're right, they get three letter cards. If they're wrong, the other players get a chance to steal. If they guess the word, they get one letter card. If they have cards, and get it wrong they lose a letter card. If no one guesses the word, another clue is read. If no one gets it the next time around the players will only receive one letter card from that point on.

Letter cards can be the letters D, I, R, T, or Y; they can also be ~ cards, Wild cards, or Action cards. Players win when they can spell DIRTY.

10816,Blackjack,1700,4.56506,1091,1.5169,2,10,30,30,Abstract Party,Card Game Math Number ,Betting/WageringPress Your Luck,"BlackJack originated in French casinos around 1700 where it was called vingt-et-un and has been played in the U.S. since the 1800's.

Blackjack is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.

A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.

The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or soft 17, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:

Hit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.

Double down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.

Splitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.

Insurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.

Surrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.

When not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.

Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations. For example, the dealer wins on ties and both of their cards are dealt face down.

There are many different card decks with various subject matter, i.e. Cars, Planes, Films, Military Jets, famous TV shows, etc...

Top Trumps are now also available in the USA, based on the classic card game War, it's played by choosing your best stat, trumping (beating) your opponents card, and winning the entire deck.

Each pack of Top Trumps consists of a number of cards (usually 30 or 32), each of which features in-game characters based on related subject matter which are full of stats, pictures and educational and interesting facts. The game is multiplayer and fits handily in the pocket so it can be played anywhere.

2-6 people can play. Deal out all the cards face down to the players. Each player holds their cards face up but may ONLY look at their top card.

The player to go first chooses the best statistic (usually the highest) from their top card, e.g. Top Speed 252mph. All other players read out the SAME statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.

During a round, if 2 or more cards tie or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card. The winner of the hand also takes the cards that were placed to one side.

The first player to win all the cards is the winner of the game!

Latest Packs available in the USA include - Royal Wedding Top Trumps, Moshi Monsters, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, US Presidents, US States, New York City, Marvel Ultimate Heroes, Soccer Stars and Soccer Stadiums, Greek Mythology, US Army, G.I. Joe, Ice Age, Transformers 2, Bugs, Baby Animals, Horses  Ponies, Star Wars, Clone Wars, Indiana Jones, James Bond, The Simpsons, Doctor Who, NBA 2010, Bugs, Dinosaurs 2010, Predators 2010, The Dog, Wildlife and Sealife In Danger, Military Jets, Ancient Egypt, and DC Super Heroes 1 and 2. As well as Star Wars and Marvel Top Trumps Tournament games.

The more familiar you are with the deck the better since you will gain from knowing what particular cards have a superior statistic compared to other cards. This adds a memory factor to the game. The cards have pictures of the subject matter and are packed with statistics and facts, and can also help improve on reading, math, and social skills.

This game is sometimes paired in the same deck with The Game of Authors a.k.a. quartets.

Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time.  If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.

The players take turns being the Reader in a clockwise direction.

After the Reader has read the first question, the other players have to decide as fast as they can whether the answer is Fact or Crap.  The players indicate their answer by putting face down either their Fact Answer card or Crap Answer card.  The Reader then determines which player was the first to put their Answer card down.  Once all of the Answer cards are down, the player who was first to answer turns over their Answer card.  If the answer is correct, they receive 2 tokens from the middle pile.  The Reader will then ask everyone to turn their Answer cards over.  All other players with the correct answer will receive 1 token.  All players with the wrong answer (including the player who puts their Answer card down first) will have to put 1 token back in the middle pile.
The Readers turn is complete when all 3 questions have been read.  The Question card is then returned, face down, to the bottom of the Question card pile.

During the game you will randomly draw Rush Hour cards.  The Reader who picks up a Rush Hour card may nominate any player to answer the Rush Hour questions.  Once the nomination has been made, the egg timer is turned over and the Reader begins to read the questions.  The aim is to have all 5 questions asked and answered within the time limit so that both Reader and the answering player have a chance to win as many extra tokens as possible.

There are two ways to win Fact or Crap.
- The game ends when all tokens from the middle pile are gone.  Players then count up their tokens.  The player with the most tokens is the winner, proving they know the most Fact or Crap!
- In the event that all players but 1 have lost their tokens, the remaining player is deemed the winner.
If at any time during the game a player loses all of their tokens, s/he is then out of the game.

The basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.

There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three accusation circles respectively. Accusing is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the Budget-Commissioner; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.

Variant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.

Anspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.

Anti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as Anti and Anti-Monopoly II was published as Choice whilst the company was forbidden to use the word Monopoly. In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed Anti-Monopoly.  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?

Each turn consists of the moderator spinning a spinner, which gives a result matching a random color with a random element from the set (left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot). Each player must put the relevant bodypart on the relevant color spot. If the bodypart is already on a spot of that color it is moved to another spot of the same color.

15549,Roulette,1796,3.40959,528,1.15,2,6,1,1,Family Party,Number ,Betting/Wagering,"Roulette is a French word meaning small wheel. It is the oldest casino game still in existence today. The exact origins of the game are unknown - there's probably been gambling using a wheel since the invention of the wheel. Some say it was invented in 1655 by the French scientist Blaise Pascal while working on a perpetual motion machine. Others say it derives from a Chinese game in which player try to move 36 statues into a magic circle. 
 The Roulette layout that we know today first appeared in 1765 in Paris, but the modern version of the game did not appear until around 1842 when Frenchmen Francois and Louis Blanc are said to have invented the single 0 roulette game. Another mystic legend tells that Francois Blanc, who founded the first casinos in Monte Carlo, sold a soul to the devil for the secret of roulette. As proof, they point out that the sum of all the numbers on a Roulette wheel added together total 666 - the number of the beast.
 The single 0 wheel became known as the French Wheel. When French immigrants brought the game to America a double zero 00 was also added and this became known as the American Wheel. The game became popular in the old west of America during the California Gold Rush.

Modern Roulette is a perfectly balanced wheel with a slot for each number. The numbers alternate between black and red (the 0 and 00 are green) and exactly opposite each other number is the corresponding higher and lower number (0 is opposite the 00, 1 is opposite the 2, and so on up to the 35 being directly opposite the 36). Players may place a multitude of wagers: Single Number pays 35:1, Two Numbers pays 17:1, Three numbers pays 11:1, Four Numbers pays 8:1, Five Numbers (American Wheel) pays 6:1, Six Numbers pays 5:1, Column or Dozen pays 2:1, High/Low Black/Red or Odd/Even pays 1:1. The 0 and 00 are not counted when calculating the odds which gives the house its edge. Ironically, no matter where you place your chips, the house edge remains almost constant (5.26% American Wheel, 2.70% French Wheel).

When all the bets are placed the croupier rolls a little ivory ball along the inner edge of the wheel in the opposite direction of its spin. As the wheel turns, the ball loses momentum, bounces among the slots and finally falls into one of the numbered slots. The number that the ball rests on is the declared as the winning number for that game and winning wagers are paid off.

Each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board.  The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the home section.  Movement is controlled by dice.  All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns.  Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over.  The winner is the first player to move all pawns home.

The Hennepin History Museum states that the first Cootie game was designed by William H. Schaper in 1949. However, Schaper's game was not the first based upon the insect known as the cootie. The creature was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the decades of the twentieth century following World War I.

In 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released Tu-Tee, and the Charles Bowlby Company released Cootie; though based on a build a bug concept similar to Schaper's, both were paper and pencil games.
Schaper's game was the first to employ a fully three dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.

You can buy a deck of cards designed for the game, but it can be easily played with a standard deck of cards:

Throw away all but one of the queens from the deck. You won't use the extra queens during play. (You may also want to throw out all black cards or all red cards to speed up the game). Deal all the cards out to the players. Players put down any pairs they have, then keep the rest of their cards in their hand, hidden from their opponents. From here on, take turns; on your turn, draw a card from any other player. If you made a pair, then put it down.

In the end, all cards except the old maid (the one queen left in the deck) will be down in pairs. Whoever holds that card loses! Everybody else wins!

The best part of this game is seeing another player draw the old maid away from you. You're supposed to keep it a secret when this happens (because other players will avoid drawing from the victim if they know that they risk the old maid by doing so), but young children usually laugh or gloat when the old maid gets taken from them. Adults playing can make the victim feel better by trying to draw the maid away from them.

Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.

Gameplay
On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.

Goal
The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.

Cultural impact on rules
Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take loans from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.

Background
In the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).

Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate Single Tax rules.

The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.

1410,Trouble,1965,3.70057,2022,1.0573,2,4,45,45,Children's,Children's Game Dice Racing ,Roll / Spin and Move,"This is the game with the Pop-O-Matic dice roller.  It's a simplified Pachisi variant in which only one die is rolled per turn.

The game is abstract, each player has set of pawns of his color. Each turn player rolls a die using the Pop-O-Matic and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is bumped, the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.

For advanced players, we suggest that when a piece gets bumped, it should only be bumped back to its START space, rather than to its HOME.  Only when bumped from their START space are pieces sent HOME.

Travel Trouble uses the same mechanisms, but is on a smaller board with fewer spaces, so it plays more quickly.

There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel or landing on spaces that tell you to move to a specific space or forward or back.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  There are a handful of choices regarding insurance and investments but for the most part it is a game of luck.

Each player advances along the rainbow path through the peppermint stick forest, the gingerbread plum tree and the gumdrop mountain. The players use the plastic gingerbread man as the playing pieces. There are colorful pieces in four colors and cards.

The Legend of the Lost Candy Castle is printed inside the box and can be read out loud. The game parts can be stored below it. The game board is colorful and has lots of yummy candy references. You play the game by moving the gingerbread playing pieces on the gameboard spaces that match the colors and pictures of the drawn cards. The object is to be the first player to reach the candy castle. There are specific directions to play. You can play with one color block, two color blocks and picture cards. If you are the first person to reach the last purple space, or move beyond the last purple space, you reach candy castle and have won the game. There are barriers along the way, like the gooey gumdrops, getting lost in the lollipop woods, or stuck in the molasses swamp.

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to break the other side's lines and achieve victory.  The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Spain and North Africa printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is just one portion of the complete EuroFront series, which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.

This title uses Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a fog of war because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.

WestFront II includes updated MedFront maps and some Spanish units; EuroFront II has the updated MedFront rules (and the Spanish Civil War scenario and other Spanish units) for those maps.

Players bid against one another to purchase the transportation tiles that are available each turn. To generate the gold for these purchases, players must make a choice each turn to either take gold or more cards. This can be a very difficult decision as tiles are useless without cards, and vice versa.

The object of the game is to be the first to get all your worms up the skeleton's bones so they disappear into his skull.

The players divide the worms between themselves, the youngest starts and the oldest gets the brain (a bad thing). On your turn, you spin the spinner to find out what you're allowed to do; this can be: 
- hang one of your worms on the skull, 
- pull a worm out of the skull and give it to another player, 
- give a worm to the player with the brain, 
- give/take the brain and spin again, 
- feed 1 worm to the skeleton, or 
- feed 2 worms to the skeleton.

When feeding worms to the skeleton, you turn the crank and hope your worm(s) will crawl up into the skull--but there's a chance it'll fall right back out into your lap, possibly accompanied by other worms that got stuck during a previous player's turn.

If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered Clobbered and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects.

You are the owner of a fancy bistro in the fashionable Quartier Latin in Paris, the most important investments are made: you have bought tables, chairs and tableware and have engaged fairly qualified personnel. Shortly before the opening of your pub the disaster happens. The competitors send hooligans to your premises that are about to destroy your work. You are determined to fight. Let 's hope that you have better cards than your opponents!

Two teams of two or three players compete with the aim to open as many pubs as they can. But they not only try to set up their own enterprise but also to cancel the efforts of the other team by any means. For this purpose the teams can hire hooligans and bombers to threat the opponents. They can also cause other inconveniences like influenza for the personnel of the other team, pipe bursts or denial of credit. The other team can defend themselves with their own hooligans, managers or the two doormen Gaston and Gustave. Both, developing / opening of pubs and getting rid of the competitors, gain points. You have, for example, destroyed the other teams disco. Not only do the others not score points with their disco if you call a disco your own, their customers come to your premises (where else could they dance?)  and you collect MONEY (points)!! But even if you only have a simple beer garden, the bomb attack was useful for your business because the disco-dancers will visit the other pubs of the quarter if they don 't find their favorite disco, and yours is one of them.

By the end of the game the most successful gastronome is obviously the one with the most points.

1100,Check the Ripper,1994,4.66667,21,1.5,2,4,45,45,,,,"Hunt serial killers with Chess moves. The game board shows a grid of squares on a map of Britain and Ireland. The players try to track down serial killers hiding in cities. At the start of the game, plastic chips which show one of four serial killers are placed face down on the cities. Players choose their detective and place it anywhere on the map. There are also four cards with images of the four killers; the top one of these is flipped open.

The active player rolls two dice which show chess pieces. If the two dice show different symbols, the player can move his/her detective the corresponding moves (i.e., any distance diagonal for a bishop). If the two rolls are the same, though, a new killer card is flipped open. If a player lands on a chip, the chip is flipped over - if it shows the same killer as the card, the player can either score points or flip over other chips with the same killer. If s/he makes a mistake, though, all points from that turn are lost. If the killer doesn't match the card, it is just returned and the players try to remember its location.

When two detectives meet, they duel each other (higher die roll wins); the winner looking at a chip and placing the loser anywhere on the board.

When all 16 killer chips have been collected (all cases solved), the game ends and the player with most points is the winner.

1129,Archimedes,1995,5.75,8,0,2,3,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Area Movement,"This is a strategy game for 2-3 players. It takes place on a 6 sided game board with pieces moving on the triangles. Each player has 4 pawns in the form of dice. The triangular fields of the board are molded so that a corner of a die exactly fits in. The die can be moved from space to space with a simple nudge at the top.

Object of the game is to get your 4 dice across the board.

PREPARATION FOR THE GAME WITH TWO ? The younger player chooses a color and puts his 4 dice into four edge spaces of his side of the board.

WHAT DOES A TURN CONSIST OF?

1.) Each turn must be executed completely. One might not skip a part of the turn. You may not move a die less than its actual movement unless you reach the finish without completing your die roll  
2.)   Dice may not touch. So a die will block 3 spaces. (2 spaces if on an edge.)
3.)   If a player has no legal move, he skips his turn.

GAME RULES FOR THREE PLAYERS All rules of the normal game for two persons are valid also for the game with three. 
Additionally you must follow these rules: 1.) Set up is different . See rules for proper 3 person set up.

The third and fourth dice of each player may only be moved, when the first and second dice have reached the finish.

1134,Road Warrior,1996,4.41,10,1.5,2,8,0,0,,Racing ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenPlayer EliminationRoll / Spin and Move,"extrapolated from session report:

This is a 1996 Australian game by Bedford and Grigor for 2-8 players.

Each player gets a bike, car or truck. To move, you roll dice - 3 for bikes, 2 for cars, 1 dice + 2 for trucks. You can ram someone by moving on top of them, higher die wins, loser goes back a space, both cars suffer hit points equal to the opposite roll. If the mover wins, they can keep going.

If you move, you can also play an action card. These can fire missiles / guns / etc. at other cars, allow you to roll more movement dice, ignore terrain effects, etc. Unless the defender has a defense card, the attack card will specify a range (in range if vehicles are less spaces away than eg result of 2 dice) and the number of dice to roll to determine hit points. Trucks start with a lot of hit points to counter their low movement, bikes start with not many. Lose all your hit points and you can start again at half hit points, or attempt to hijack another car.

The track is about 100 spaces long, with some bridges / crossovers and 5 different terrain types. For example you need to roll multiples of 5 to move each snow space, 4 for oil spaces. There are obstacle spaces which allow you to pull an instantly applied obstacle card. These are a mix of mostly good and occasional bad events.

You can also pass and simply pick up an action card. Last car standing or first one past the finish line wins.

1135,Quest For Power,1997,3.14286,7,2,1,8,90,90,,Adventure Card Game Exploration Fantasy Fighting ,Co-operative PlayModular BoardVariable Player Powers,"Quest for Power is billed as a Game Masterless Role-Playing System. In actuality, it is a fantasy-themed board game where the board is constructed each play session from randomly dealt cards. It has all the trappings of a role-playing game: character generation, multiple races and professions, skills, spells, weapons, etc. But the actual game play is very much a board game: move along the board, turn over unexplored cards, and deal with the situation given on them. Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.

Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S. (Random Adventure Game Generating System). The sub-title for the game is Darkness in the Light and it is called a Starter Set for Character Levels 1 - 3, presumably because other scenarios and rules for higher level characters were planned. As far as I know, no expansions for the game were ever produced and Infinite Imagination, Inc. is no more.

Players race their balloons, and special dice are used to determine the change of orientation of a large wind rose, which indicates the amount of movement permitted in each direction, but lines on the board indicate which directions can be travelled in from each space. Cards are dealt out to indicate start position, end position and four intermediate points in each player's route. Very nice item.

Lucky Five
by Heinz Meister
A dice game for 2  6 players
Ages 10 and up


Contents
33 cards
3 dice
60 chips (42 light green, 12 dark green, 6 black)
Card tray

Preparation
 Place the card tray in the middle of the table.
 Shuffle the cards and place them face down in one side of the card tray to form the draw pile.
 Roll the three dice and place them next to the card tray.
 Give each player 10 chips worth a total of 270 points, as follows: 7 light green chips worth 10 each, 2 dark green chips worth 50 each, and 1 black chip worth 100.

Play
 The player who has been the luckiest today begins the game. Play then proceeds clockwise.
 A players turn must always be taken in this order (during which steps 1  4 may repeat several times):
1. Turn over a card. The cards show what dice must be rolled in step 3.
2. Put down a chip. Then the player decides  based on the card and the intended dice roll  which chip he would prefer to put down. You can only put down one chip per card (one 10-point chip, one 50-point chip or one 100-point chip). Place it in the middle of the table next to the exposed card.
3. Bet and roll the dice. Now the player must predict the total roll of the respective dice on the card when compared with the numbers currently showing on the dice.
4. Evaluate the roll. The players bet will be right or wrong. Right bets mean two possibilities for this player:
 He/she may take another turn, going through steps 1  4 again.
 Or he/she may end his/her turn. He/she takes all the upturned cards from the middle of the table, puts them in a stack in front of him/her and puts the chips from the middle of the table on the stack.

The game ends when only one player has chips left. This player gets one final turn. If he/she bets wrong, the chips are left in the middle of the table; nobody can use them in the scoring. The same goes for chips that were not yet used in betting.

The game also ends if no more cards can be drawn. In this case chips not yet used in betting do not score, either.

Scoring and winning
Each player scores his/her stacks separately, by multiplying the number of cards in the stack by the total value of the chips in the stack. Then add the separate stack scores together for a grand total. The winner is the player with the highest grand total. In case of a tie, the player with the most cards wins.

1179,Tendix,1998,5.57692,13,2,2,3,45,45,,,,"PROCESS OF GAME
The player whose turn it is draws one tile from the bag and places it on any free space.
The colour on top is decisive for the effect of the tile. All tiles in the distance that corresponds to the colour (straight line) are turned upside down. Diagonal distances do not count here. Violet (zero) up means of course that nothing is turned. Only a just placed tile can have an effect, there are no chain reactions.
Example: If I lay down a tile with orange up, all tiles that are exactly two spaces away from that tile are turned around, but not those who are one or more than two spaces away. The games lasts until all tiles are placed and the board is completed.

from the rules translation
OBJECT OF THE GAME
At the end of the game every player counts separately the number of tiles showing his two colours on the top. Now he subtracts the lower number from the higher one. That is his final result.
Example: With red and green as my colors, eight red tiles are tying up and three green ones. Thus I have five points.
If the final result, of two players is the same, the player with more tiles up (sum of the two colours) wins the game.

The players simultaneously bet on meal cards; if you bet correctly (i.e. nobody else bet on that particular meal), you move up around the table, closer to the softest cushion (and victory).  The heftier the meal, the more you advance.  Some of the meal cards have a ghost on their back; if you win one of those, you move back instead of forward.  You also have a silver platter; you can use that to send the ghost to another cat --but he'll then have the silver platter for later, and you won't...

One final note: when multiple players bet on the same meal, their betting tokens remain on the card for the next betting round --this mechanic forces the implicated players to choose something else, and can signal an opportunity for the lone player to be in a position to bet on that meal...

Simple and fast playing.

Whoever adjusts most quickly to this backward world has the best chance of winning this thinking game.

In game terms, you lay out a central card that shows the words up, down, left and right in the appropriate places, then lay out one picture card on each side of that central card. You then flip over task cards one by one, and if a task card says left you look for the card on the right of the central card; if the task card asks for the name of what lies there, you instead give the sound it makes. The first person to do so wins the card, and whoever collects the most task cards wins the game.

An expert version adds color to the mix, with both a red and a blue central card, and four picture cards around each of those and player needing to look to red whenever the task card calls for blue.

Players try to plunder opponents safes while protecting their own. So the player who possesses the most stolen treasures at the end wins. Be careful, however: some safes are secured with an alarm system. And this barking, vicious alarm system is called Bodo Boxo!

The game contains 110 cards, consisting of 80 treasure cards, 20 safe cards and 10 plus/minus cards.

From the 20 safe cards, 15 cards show on the back the picture Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded and 5 cards show the picture Boxo Awake Pants Torn.

The 10 plus/minus cards are not played. They are used only to keep plus and minus scores separated.

Each player gets all  treasure cards of a color. The player then shuffles his treasure cards and puts them in a facedown stack on the table.   Now each player uses the  4 safe cards: 3 with the picture Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded and 1 with the picture Boxo Awake Pants Torn. to put his treasures in the safes. Players turn over the top 4 treasure cards from their stacks and put them in the middle of the table, side by side so that all players can see their values. Each player covers his 4 face-up treasure cards with a safe card, with the safe picture face up, but with the values of the treasure cards still visible. One of the safe cards is hot, because it shows Bodo Boxo with a scrap of pants on the back. Each player decides which of his 4 treasure cards will get the hot safe card. The players cannot tell which of their opponents? treasure cards is hot, since all safe cards look the same from the front. The first player then tries to break in to a safe. If the card from the safe shows BOXO ASLEEP then the  BREAK-IN SUCCEEDED and the player takes the stolen treasure card and puts it facedown under his plus card. If the card shows that BOXO is AWAKE  then the Boxo bites the player tearing his pants so the player gets caught and the value of the card from that safe is deducted from his score.  The alarm has startled Lord Schlotterderry. He immediately attends to the remaining safes. The robbed player immediately puts all his treasure cards that are still in safes under his plus card! Now, the next player going clockwise takes a turn. If a player is not able to plunder because he is the only one with unopened safes, he must forfeit his turn.  Play continues with each player taking his turn.

Each player then  replenishes his safes for another round. The game continues until 4 rounds of safe cracking are finished when each player adds up the values of his collected treasure cards. The plus points are added and the minus points are subtracted. Whoever has the highest score is the winner.

Play 4 rounds are played. In each round, the safes are first filled with treasures, which one can plunder as long as he dares.

48 playing cards
42 trick indicator cards; 6 colored sets with values of 0 - 6
1 scorepad
1 pen
1 rulebook

Description of the game
The main task of the 3 - 6 players is to correctly assess their cards. They use a trick indicator card to declare the number of tricks they expect to take. If they're right, they get a bonus. It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware! A face-up trick indicator card increases the possibility that the other players will be able to influence the outcome. With increased risk it's true that you get: Alles oder Nichts (Double or Nothing).

A game last for seven rounds. Each player receives:
in the 1st round - 6 cards
in the 2nd round - 5 cards
in the 3rd round - 4 cards
in the 4th round - 3 cards
in the 5th round - 4 cards
in the 6th round - 5 cards
in the 7th round - 6 cards

After the cards are dealt, the dealer turns over the top card of the remaining cards. The color of this card is the trump color. After distributing the cards, players take the playing cards into their hand. Each player now judges for himself how many tricks he thinks he can take. Players select the appropriate card from their trick indicator cards and place it face-down in front of themselves

Once all players have made their decision, the dealer, starting with the player to his left, asks each player if he wants to openly announce the number of tricks he plans to take (by turning over his trick indicator card) or if he wishes to keep it secret. Once each player has indicated his decision, the dealer asks the other players in clockwise order until all players, including the dealer have indicated their decision. Turning over the trick indicator card brings a higher risk but also potentially more points.

Rules of play:

Players must follow suit (play the same color as the card that was lead) if it is possible for them to do so.

If a player cannot follow suit, he has two possibilities:
1. Play trump - play a card of the trump color
2. Throw off - play a card that is neither the trump color nor the color that was lead. You can never win a trick when you throw off.

If no trump was played, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was lead wins the trick.
If trump was played, the player who played the highest trump card wins the trick.

If the trump color was lead, it must also be followed. If a player does not have any cards in the trump color, he must throw off a card with another color.

Scoring
Secret trick indicator cards:
Players whose trick indicator cards were face-down get one point for each trick that they took. Players who took exactly as many tricks as noted on their trick indicator card get a 3 point bonus.

Openly declared trick indicator cards:
Players whose trick indicator cards were turned face-up only get points get if they take exactly as many tricks as they predicted. If they fulfill this condition, their score is equal to the number of tricks they took multiplied by 2 plus the 3 point bonus.

Goal of the game
The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.

2 dice
Play money

Aim of the game
Each player invests his capital in many possible ways, in an attempt to earn money. The first player to earn 500,000 Euros or another appointed sum wins.

Only cash counts toward winning the game. It is therefore necessary to part with investments again and again. Possible credits, of course, count against you.

Play
1st action
On your turn, roll one die and move. Move your pawn on
the inner track in the direction of the arrows, as many spaces as you rolled.

2nd action
Follow the directions for the space you land on.

Most of the spaces on the inner track are connected to outer fields. The outer field decides what options a player has in each case. So, you can - according to the outer field - buy or sell stock, save money or withdraw it, buy or sell real estate, buy or sell a life insurance policy, buy or sell a treasury note, or buy or sell precious
metals. Or you may land on a wage or salary space, which always brings profit.

What you buy you can also sell, depending which space you are on. When you are on a stock space, for example, you can only buy or sell shares. When you are on one of the two savings spaces, you can only buy or sell savings cards, etc.

3rd action
You must draw a Banking card and either play it now or keep it in your hand. You can also draw and play a precious metal card to replace the card already lying in the middle of the game board.

Precious metal cards are an optional draw. A Banking card must be drawn along with the precious metal card so the price of the precious metals and shares of stock change again and again.

Players play cards from their hands which may effect themselves, effect another player or function as tiles on the board.  In this case, they alter the movement point cost to enter that space.

Next, players roll dice to build up power (movement) points and move their figure appropriately.

As in Parcheesi, the first player to complete one trip around the board wins.

Other items spice up this mix.  Power chips may be spent to add to your roll, but must be spent before you roll.  The Violator pawn sends a Spawn pawn back.  The Overtkill pawn makes it harder to enter its space.

The board is made up of 16 non-movable square road tiles. There are 3 vertical and 3 horizontal rows for the 34 seperate, loose road tiles to be placed randomly. 33 tiles go onto the board leaving one extra tile.

Each tile has road section printed on them, straights, turns, and 3-way intersections.
There are also 19 Success Symbols printed on 19 of the moving and immobile tiles corresponding to the symbols printed on the Success Deck cards.
The Success cards have money rewards ranging from $100,000
to $300,000, paid when the player reaches the proper symbol on the board as printed on the card.

Players place their car tokens on the proper corner start space and draw a Success card to indicate their current destination.

Each player tries to form a road path to their symbol by using the extra road tile to push one of the tile rows. This shifts the tiles so that the end tile comes off the
board, to be used by the next player.
A player who reaches his symbol is paid the Success Card amount and draws a new card. First player to amass $1,000,000 and return to his/her start point wins.

In RYB, each player controls a pool of 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 blue six-sided dice.  These dice are used to complete Goals that are played to the middle of the table.  Different goals require different combinations of dice.  If a player fails to complete a Goal, they can bank points on that Goal for future use, but those points are available to anyone who attemps to compete that Goal.

Each player also maintains a hand of cards.  In addition to Goals, there are other cards that allow players to take, swap, and borrow dice and to re-roll failed attempts to complete a Goal.

RYB makes an excellent children's game because encourages lots of addition, subtraction, and comparison of quantities while keeping the focus of the game away from the math itself.

See the following site:
http://www.invisible-city.com/games/rhrnoframe.htm

Each player is a hamster on a 5x10 conveyor belt that leads to a pit of hungry Alligators. The object of the game is to be the last hamster left in play. There are several hazards that make this challenging:


     The Conveyor Belt: You must keep moving up the Conveyor Belt or you'll get dumped off the edge into... 
     The Alligator Pit: At the end of the Conveyor Belt is a pit with one or more hungry alligators in it. If it comes down to a battle between a hamster and an alligator, my money's on the reptile. 
     Other hamsters: Other hamsters may try to push you into the Alligator Pit to increase their odds of being the last one in the game. Be careful! 
     Fatigue: The stress of constant exertion will wear down even the heartiest hamster. You've got to stop running eventually you know... 


Instead of using dice, Run, Hamster, Run! has players put chips in a bag to determine the outcome of contests. This use of chips creates a strong focus on resource allocation. As the hamsters take damage or become fatigued, they lose chips from their pool, further emphasizing the importance of careful resource usage.

The Peeps are resource providers.  When a Peep is at a Supply Center, then additional jellybeans can be brought into play.  The jellybeans are the soldiers and are primarily used for attacking and claiming territory.

Conflict between jellybeans is resolved by placing all beans in the conflict in an easter egg and drawing one out at random.  The side that controls the bean drawn wins that combat and gets to eat one opposing bean.

Each player is delt 10 cards and as in standard Rummy you can put down melds of runs or sequences.  They can be from either side but the sides can not be mixed.  When one player goes out points are scored for the cards left in the opponents hand.  Counting the standard side only Aces count 1 point, face cards 10 points and all other cards face value.

The board is an Ancient Egyptian Senet board, and the game can be played as such if one supplies the throwing sticks (randomizing devices that eventually evolved into dice; available in commercial Senet sets or easily home-made).  Note, however, that there are only 4 pieces per player instead of the almost-standard 5 (historically, the number of pieces per player varied between 5 and 10), so a fifth piece would ideally need to be supplied.
H. A. Renz chose, once more, to use the components for an entirely different, modern abstract strategy game.  Each player uses two special dice to move both his pieces and his adversary's (this is the only game of the triad to have a random element).  The object of the game is to either push all adversary pieces into the water (a special square), occupy the happiness square with one's last remaining piece, or box the adversary in so he cannot move.
Note how driving towards one victory condition (by adversary elimination) actually opens up a victory opportunity for the adversary --a neat twist.
Remarkably, the starting position is asymmetric because the board is asymmetric.  There does not seem to be much of an advantage or handicap to being one side or the other.

1548,Libero,1984,6,1,0,2,2,45,45,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Sports ,,"Abstract Soccer Game played on a grid of squares. Each player has eleven wooden tokens - nine basic ones, one libero (sweeper) and one goalkeeper. Each piece has a small dent on top so the ball can be placed on it. 
In a turn, the active player can pass the ball as many times as s/he wishes, in a straight unblocked line (diagonal, too), and move one piece. Regular pieces move any distance diagonally, while the libero can move orthogonally as well (same as the goalie, who is restricted to the box, though). A piece that reaches a field adjacent to an opponent piece with the ball can grab the ball. Goals can be scored if a piece that is not offside can play the ball into the goal in a straight line.

One half time is played until a player has scored three goals. After two half times, the player with most goals is the winner (in case of a tie, an extension is played).

The mystique, incredible courage, and tragic flaws of the Japanese soldier are vividly portrayed in the tense, exciting games of simulated man-to-man combat which only Up Front presents in such panoramic splendor.

Owners of Up Front will find the game system extensions included herein to be the ultimate of simplicity and convenience; while adding rich detail to the portrayal of the Japanese and British nationalities, as well as accounting for American marines. Twelve new scenarios depict not only typical SW Pacific encounters, but allow more variations for Up Front's existing European scenarios as the British take on the Germans, or the Russians test the Japanese in Manchuria. Several new scenario types list European variations, thus expanding the scope of Up Front's possible encounters. And of course, the complicated T. O.  E. and capabilities of the new nationalities have been distilled into the eminently playable Personnel cards of the Up Front game system.

Contents:
1 Rule Book (Contains 12 Scenarios)
63 Counters
60 Personel Cards
20 AFV Cards
