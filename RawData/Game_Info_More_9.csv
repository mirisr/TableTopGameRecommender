15702,Samas,2004,0,0,0,2,2,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Racing ,Rock-Paper-Scissors,"Samas is a simple abstract 2-player racing game that incorporates a Paper-Scissors-Stone  mechanic to determine which player is allowed to move on the track towards the finishing space.

The board consists of a single track with 9 hollows. Each player places their Sama-stone on the second hole from their baseline. Both players also get 13 stones in their color, and 2  joker-stones. All these stones are kept hidden behind the player's screens.

Every turn each player secretly selects 0 to 3 regular stones, or a joker-stone. These are then simultaneously revealed, the Sama-stone of the player with the winning selection moves one place towards the opponent's side, and the stone-selection of both players are removed from play.

If both players reveal the same stone-selection, then these stones are still removed from play, but neither Sama-stone gets moved forwards. If a player runs out of stones then the opponent's Sama-stone moves 1 space forwards for each regular stone still in this player's reserve.

So what makes a winning selection? A selection of regular stones gets beaten by a higher amount of regular stones. A joker-stone beats any amount of regular stones. However, if a joker-stone is played when the opponent decided to play no stones at all, than it in turn is beaten.

Play continues until one player reaches the opposite side of the board, or until a player runs out of stones to play. The winner is predictably the player who reaches, or gets closest to, the other side of the board.

Publishing history: Together with Trio Trio, Samas was the first of Frank's designs to get published (in 2004) in the deluxe wooden format that typifies the Clemens Gerhards range. Up until then Frank Stark had been making mainly card games, Zoom being the only boardgame that had found a (different) publisher. However, since then Frank Stark's boardgame designs have become regular additions to the Clemens Gerhards stable, all in the same high-quality make-up that they do so well.

Two half-sized maps of all-blue, large hex water terrain. Two countersheets (308) with Panzerblitz-sized counters. Two identical single-sided PAC with 8 small charts each. A rulebook (28 pgs) with 8 scenarios ranging from 1917 to 1924 (with a SF one in 3325 (not kidding!). The rules only look to be about 5-6 pages long.

From what I have been told, this is an extremely popular game I Japan. The auction prices are all rather high, even for punched games. This might have something to do with the easy rules and only a few charts. Each counter has 6 numbers and they are back printed. The back side has two numbers reduced by one vs. the units front side. There is unit facing and maybe a line movement rule. No record keeping or markers.

The Battle of Bautzen has one 17x22 map, 252 counters, two PAC (identical) and a 16 pg rulebook.

BoB looks very much like a NAW system game with some changes to the combat rules. The counters have three numbers-attack, defense (?) and movement. Leaders have two numbers, similar in placement to NAW games. The CRT is the biggest change however. It uses a 2-12 roll and the results are far more deadly to both sides. There are some morale results as well. Overall, a very simple-looking game on a totally neglected battle.

The player indicates which they saw, using a hidden disc marked A and B, then the player next to him/her announces which way they believe the active play saw the image, the active player then reveals the disc. Each card has instructions on the back, one for both A and B, that will help or hurt a player. If the announcing player was correct, they choose who must follow the instruction otherwise the active player chooses.

Prize pieces must be landed on exactly and, once a player wins a prize piece they may move the part of the board it was on. This can be used to break the board into separate sections, stranding opponents. The rules vary based on the number of players playing but, collecting a requisite number and type of prize pieces wins the game.

The players' men work as traders / hunters / trappers / messengers, and earn their main income (= points) by traveling from station to station along the trail marked by the circles.  Supplementary sources of income are bear-hunting and bounty-hunting (there are sometimes Wanted-warrants out for the men of one or more players).  After each round of player action, the bears move autonomously (on the squares) and keep the players on their toes by occasionally attacking / eating their employees.  The challenge consists in being the player who assesses the risks and chances involved most successfully.

Great game play recreates all the tension and excitement of losing a tooth - including that Wobbly Tooth Dilemma: do you have the courage to pull your tooth out - or don't you?

15874,Bushi Shogi,2000,6.30833,12,2,2,2,10,10,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Dice ,,"Bushi Shogi is a Shogi variant played by two opponents on a field of two cells, with two pieces called Samurai. The pieces are cubes with kanji in red for 'samurai' and kanji in black for 'sword' on each face.

The playing field starts empty. Each player receives one Samurai and, beginning with Black, drops them onto their respective cells in turn. Such placement must be so that the upward face of the cube does NOT present a 'sword' kanji toward the opponent.

Movement consists of either rotating the cube one face clockwise, rolling it forward one face toward the opponent, rolling it    left one face or rolling it right one face.

The upward face of each cube controls the play of the game. If an opponent cube presents an upward face which has a forward 'sword' and the upward face of the player's cube does NOT present a forward 'sword', the player must rotate only. If an opponent cube presents a 'sword' forward, and the player presents a 'sword' forward, the player must roll the cube directly away from the 'samurai' kanji on its upward face.

The game is won by the player who is able to present an upward face with a forward 'sword' and a rearward 'samurai' when the opponent cube also presents a forward 'sword' with a rearward 'samurai'. The 'samurai' are considered to be facing each other with their 'swords' met.

Contents:
2 sheep
1 moon
1 star
1 large die (1 or 2 pips)
1 game board
1 set of rules

The game board is set up in the box so that it forms a two sided 'ramp' that the sheep set out to climb (ask not why).

There are two 'games' in this box. The first game is a perfunctory singing activity.

The second game involves a race to the top of the game board. One player secretly selects the moon or the star and inserts the chosen piece into their side of the board (hidden from the other player's view). The other player guesses which piece has been inserted. If correct, the guessing player rolls the die and advances their sheep 1 or 2 rungs up the game board. The guessing player now becomes the choosing player, and play alternates in this manner until one sheep makes it to the apex of the board.

Ages 2½ and up.

Stanley Ipkiss just tried on an eerie old mask he found in the river--and started to spin 'round like a whirlwind until he was transformed into ... The Mask! During all the commotion, Stanley's Pajamas, Clock, and faithful dog Milo whirled right out the window, and they've landed all around the city. Plus, The Mask did something bad: he went out and robbed a bank! Stanley better hurry up and collect his stuff--and get that money back to the bank!

On your turn, you roll the die and move the number of spaces indicated. If you land on a space with a chip, you turn it over, and if its an item of your color you keep it. If you land on The Mask space, you place the mask piece over your playing piece (like a hood) and become The Mask. This gives you special powers including: the ability to ignore the die and move to the space you want, and ability to land on opponent's starting space and return a color chip back to the track. As soon as another player lands on the mask space, you have to remove the mask from your mover and give it to your opponent. The first player to collect and return all 4 missing items of his or her color wins.

15940,Snob,1983,5,3,0,2,4,30,30,,Economic Negotiation ,Auction/BiddingBetting/WageringRoll / Spin and MoveSet CollectionStock HoldingTrading,"Snob - A fantasy shopping spree

Snob is a roll-and-move game in the style of Monopoly.  The goal of Snob is to be the first player to spend and/or accumulate 10 million dollars (or other arbitrary dollar figure).  Players move around the board and collect Customer Service cards that add or detract from their dollar total -- if the amount on the Customer Service cards exceeds the amount on the space where the player has landed, they can gamble and re-roll to see if they can spend more.

In addition to the regular spaces, there are Gold spaces which correspond to luxury items the players can buy in the auction (e.g. Oil Wells, Yacht, Furs, etc.) The player who landed on the space reads the description of the item and players make bids and attempt to be closest to the value of the described item without overbidding.  The player who was closest adds the item to their stockpile of goods.  Additionally, there is a Swiss Bank Account space that rewards the player whose account number is drawn from the account deck.

Without any background information, Snob appears to be a small-print game or game prototype with high production values.  The components include the game board, two nice plastic card trays with 8 varieties of cards, Snob emblazoned notepads for each player, and glass jewels that serve as player pieces.

Standard scoring rules for American football apply.

At least two editions of the game were produced. The first edition in 1973 had no official tie ins with the NFL. It provided 25 team markers listing the host city for each NFL team of the day, replacing New England with Boston and only giving one marker for New York. A later edition featured O.J. Simpson on the box cover and the game was retitled accordingly.

Talking Football is one of those gimmicky games from the early 1970s that could go under a mechanic called record-driven. The players use a set of 13 custom records to drive the action; 10 for offense/defense play selection, and 3 for special plays (penalties, field goals, etc.).

The offensive player secretly chooses a play disc and inserts it into the record player sportcaster. The opposing player rotates the record in the player, looking at the back of the disc to select their defense. Once the defensive selection is in view from the defense's side, that player pushes down to start the recording. The sportscaster gives a yardage/penalty result for the play (the records were multi-groved and would play differently based on which 'defense' was chosen.

Rated for ages 10-adult. Each set supports 2 players, so you can add more sets for multi-player battles.

THROW UP is usually played as a drinking game (rule 1: Ensure that you have a ready supply of liquid refreshments). The game begins as a rhythmic word game. Players tap the table and clap in rhythm. The first player calls out a word and the player to his/her left shouts out a word that begins with the final letter of the first word (e.g., word 1 = cat, word 2 = ten, word 3 = naked...). Players who cannot think of a word, break the rhythm, or who make a mistake must roll a pewter die (it is in the form of a drunk; it reminds me of the pigs in Pass the Pigs) to determine a penalty.

The position of the die determines the penalty:
? A choker: take a large swallow.
? A sticky ear (bottle up): you and the player to your left take a large swallow.
? A sticky ear (fish up): you and the player to your right take a large swallow.
? A gutter: choose one of the other players to take a large swallow.
? A dribbler: propose a toast; everyone takes a drink.
? A tumble: Off the table, finish your glass.

The game includes:
? 1 Pewter drunk figure
? 1 pen
? 1 forfeit pad
? 1 forfeit summary card
? 1 carry pouch
? 1 set of rules

15998,Totopoli,1996,6.34444,27,2,2,6,120,120,,Racing ,Auction/BiddingBetting/WageringModular BoardRoll / Spin and MoveStock Holding,"This Italian version of the original Totopoly, was first published in Italy in the '70s and after a restyling it came back in 1996. It shares a very close build up and look with its ancestor, but it also bears some custom traits which give it an Italian taste.
First off, the horses's names are unmistakably Italian: Nearco, Niccol Dell'Arca, Orsenigo, Astolfina...
I wouldn't put my hand across a flame saying that they're all real names, but undoubtedly some of them are.
The gameboard is double sided (in the '70s version instead you had to change the board simply folding a flap page over it) with the training course on one side and the racing track on the other.
The game is played in two distinct phases: training and race.
During the training phase all the players bid to get the fastest horses, usually the black or red ones, and occupations which can give them more money to bet before the race.
Then starts the training. Every horse, starting from no.1 to no.12, gets out from its stables (San Siro at Milan or Capannelle at Rome) and rolling two dice it runs one full lap, before re-entering its own stable.
During this lap the players collect Advantage colored chits (to be used as bonus during the race) or Disadvantage white chits (to be spent during the race as penalties), and pay various taxes for the maintenance, health and fitness of their horses.
To be said, a good training isn't enough to grant you have a winner, because the subsequent race phase bears a great share of randomness.
Totopoli is not only a racing game, but a betting one also, so this is perfectly normal.
Luck and tactics here join together while you're searching for the best lane in every situation, but along the track some dangers are lurking to slow or either exit your horse from the race.
You can win the game as being the winner at the race, or you can win through your money.
And you can play dirty to ease the way for the horse you bet on.
The box includes a double sided board, 12 plastic horses, 78 cards, Advantage and Disadvantage chits, bet bills and two dice.

To begin, each player sits by a colored button and speaks a word into the microphone. The game starts by Max flashing a player's light and repeating that player's word. The player scores a point by quickly pressing his or her button. If your reaction time is too slow you lose a point. Max then calls another player's word and so on. Be careful - Max can also bluff by calling one player's word and lighting another player's light. Any player that reacts would then lose a point. The longer you play, the faster the words are spoken and the lenses light. The player with the most points at the end is the winner. An elimination version, and a simple memory game (ala Simon) can also be played.

Players win money by playing different games of chance which are decided by the spaces on the board.  Players roll the dice on their turn, move, then decide if they want to play the game on the space where they landed.  There are eleven different games of chance.  Some are played against The house (the board), and some are played against other players.

Playing a game always costs money to play.  There is a flat fee to play the game, and some of the games allow you to bet more money to increase the payout.

The Games:

1)  Best of Five - Roll five dice to get two, three, four, five of a kind, a full house or a run.  You may roll five dice up to three times

2)  Bonus 21 - Played with another player.  Roll one die up to five times to get as close to 21 as you can without going over. Whoever comes closest wins all the money bet.

3)  Double Trouble - bet that you will or won't roll doubles with two dice.

4)  Pair-a-dice Derby - You may buy or win horses which you can race against other players.  There is a horse track in the center of the board.

5)  Three + Three - Try to rolls two threes with two dice in as few rolls as possible.

6)  Diamond Jim - Try to beat the total of two 6 sided dice with one 8 sided die.

7)  Unlucky One - Keep rolling the die and earning the number you roll, unless you roll a one, in which case you lose everything.

8)  Lottery Dice - Everyone chooses a number, then a die is rolled.  Whoever guessed the number wins the lottery.

9)  Even Odds - Win double your bet if you correctly guess that two dice will be odd or even.

10) Challenge - Played against another player.  Whoever rolls highest wins the bet.

11) Impossible 36 - Try to roll 36 by rolling two dice three times.  Huge payout if you succeed.

There is an open house space that lets you play the game of your choice.

The game ends when the last player completes the last circuit of the board.

Call 'em' All is the furiously fast and frantic think it and shout it game.

In Call 'em All players are given a category and in 60 seconds they have to think of as many items to do with that category as they can and shout them all out.

This may sound easy, but, wouldn't you just know it, there's a catch!  Shout as loud as you can, as quickly as you can, as many items as you can but the only ones which will score you points are the ones that appear on the card.

Call 'em All contains 130 categories as diverse as 'Types of Fruit', 'Parts of a Car' and 'Things Found in a Chemist'.  It's a non-stop riot of laughter which will amuse you, your family and friends for hours.

Get your brain in gear, get your mouth in gear because Call 'em All is here.

Contents: 130 game cards, 2 sets of number cards, 1 scorepad, 1 pencil, 1 60 second timer, 2 counters, rules of the game.

Each player in turn takes a card from the deck, which will list a category and ten items in that category.  They lay out ten cards numbered 1 to 10 to match the items, and place a counter on the item they think the other players are least likely to guess.

All the other players then have 60 seconds to shout out as many items as they can in the category, hoping to match the ten on the card.  The player reading the category card turns over the number cards as the matching items are called.

At the end of the round, all the guessing players each score one point for each of the items they have collectively guessed, plus three bonus points if they guess the item with the counter on.  The reading player scores one point for each item that was not guessed, again plus three bonus points if the counter-marked item was not guessed.

The next player then takes the next category card, and the previous card reader re-joins the guessers.  In this way the game is co-operative, but the teams are constantly changing and each player will have their own individual score by the game end.

Play continues for as many rounds as the players decide, although for fairness everyone should have the same number of turns as the card reader.

Suitable for ages 10+.

16043,Ambition,2003,6.69167,12,3.6667,3,4,60,60,,Card Game ,Trick-taking,"Ambition is a trick taking standard deck playing card game. It was invented by Indie designer Mike Church whose stated goal was to create a trick game where the role of chance (hand-luck) was as small as possible.

The usual object is to avoid taking the most points in a round and, secondarily, to score as many as possible up to that. (That is, if the 120 points split 42-34-25-19, it's best to be the '34' and worst to be the '42'.) Bonuses, known as Nil and Slam, are given respectively for taking no points or for taking 75+. Thus, almost any hand dealt has some strategy: few terrible hands exist.

Ambition is as much a game of players, and the interactions of their varying strategic objectives, as of cards.

For improvement's sake, the inventor has updated the game several times since its first publication in November 2003. The most recent rules were published in July 2012.

Gambler was invented by Charlie Towlson and friends in 1987 and has attracted a huge cult following amongst those who play it. This has lead to annual tournaments, most notably the UK Championships which grows in attendance every year.

The object of the game is to gamble your way around the world on a set course of Reno - London - Monte Carlo - Tokyo - Sun City - Las Vegas. The game is won when a player completes the course and finally wins a bet in Las Vegas. This means that the climax to every game is always a winning bet; failure to win that bet means the game continues.

Gambler made its serious debut at the London International Toy Fair in 1998 and was voted in the Top Ten New Games.

Players take turns flipping two cards face up; if they match, the player keeps the pair and goes again, otherwise the cards are flipped face down and the turn passes to the next player.  One minor rule that I don't remember from the original Memory game is that, once a pair is removed, the holes that are thus formed are immediately filled by shifting cards to the right.

Flying Aces, played with the cards depicting the airplanes, is a variant of War.  Each player is given a stack of cards; everyone places their top card face up in the center of the table, and if exactly one player plays a Sea Duck, they win all the cards; otherwise, it's a tie, and everyone goes again.

Forces of darkness and magic strive to unleash a horror upon the Earth unlike any mankind can remember. The only forces capable of stopping it are rendered impotent by an age-old fear and hatred. Will humanity set aside their differences and stand as one against the darkness? Or will this be humanity's Final Twilight?

Final Twilight is a modern fantasy themed card game for two players.
Players each select a Major Character featured in the game's storyline and build a deck around that character; supporting characters, special action and spells, weapons and items, all ripped from the pages of the story come to life on the game board. 
Using Location cards to build a small portion of the great city of New Metropolis, players move between sites and backdrops of the story, dueling other characters including fantastic creatures, horrors of the shadows, and helpful, though innocent, bystanders. 
Magic is scarce and unusual in the world of Final Twilight. While hiring goons and allies from our normal world can be easy, summoning the vast forces of nature takes its toll; fantastic characters, spells, and magical abilities all require a small piece of the mage. To cast these spells players spend a portion of their life total, potentially granting them greater power but opening them up to easier defeat. Winning is balancing the quest for power against the will to survive!

Final Twilight is customizable and non-collectable, with each release featuring pre-constructed decks and expansion packs containing just the right cards for a character or an assortment of universal cards suitable for any character.

The reader than picks a rating from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) and everyone else secretly tries to guess the readers choice.

The choice and all guesses are revealed simultaneously. Correct guessers roll the dice to move forward, everyone else moves back a number of spaces equal to the difference between the guess and the actual answer.

Elan is designed for Wargames representing Divisional and Corps sized combat on the European continent from 1805 to 1815 in 25mm or 15mm. It provides gamers with a system focused on the tactical employment of units from Brigade down to company level.

Elan aims to capture the feel of combat during the period, and will satisfy players who approach their games with an appreciation for the actual tactics used by the Generals of the period. Use of combined arms, effective command and keeping a reserve up your sleeve are the keys to success.

The rules are also perfect for tournament games allowing for objectives, quick results and good reflection of a player's ability as opposed to just sheer luck.

For play purposes a Tactical Turn represents about 20 minutes, and with the Grand Tactical aspects included, a Turn represents about 1 hour. All measurements are in millimeters representing 1 meter per millimeter. The rules are written with measurements for 25mm scale figures, but 15mm is equally suitable by modifying distances.

Includes reference charts.

The Nuclear Energy game is one of several to come out in the wake of the incident at Three Mile Island. Players attempt to acquire operating licenses for nuclear power plants, which serve as a source of income. Similarly, they try to avoid meltdowns or other mishaps at those same plants. Licensed sites serve as a source of income from other players who land on them as well as producing contract fees in their own right. After a pre-determined amount of time (the designer suggests 90 minutes), players tally assets and the person with the highest total wins.

There are humorous touches in both the instructions and on the game board, ranging from the disclaimer that any small errors were incorporated intentionally in order to confuse the foreign intelligence community, to a sign pointing away from the power plant marked fallout shelter and another pointing straight down marked China. The back page gives a line-item account of the actual events at Three Mile Island leading to the release of radioactive gas.

16123,Anno Domini: Sachsen,2005,6.75,14,0,2,8,30,30,,Bluffing Card Game Trivia ,Hand Management,"Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.
If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.

Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this aint no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because its full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.

Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.

The set Sachsen contains historical events which are related to Sachsen. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the Sachsen edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.

16128,Bibi Blocksberg und das Geheimnis der blauen Eulen!,2004,4.75,8,0,2,5,30,30,,Maze Movies / TV / Radio theme ,MemoryRoll / Spin and Move,"This game was released at the same time of the movie Bibi Blocksberg und das Geheimnis der blauen Eulen! (translated as Bibi Blocksberg and the Secret of the Blue Owls!) in Germany. The movie (with the title character Bibi, who is a young witch) is based on a decades-old, long-running radio play and animated series but was also inspired by the success of the Harry Potter movies.

It's a roll and move game for juniors with four quests to complete. Roll and move effect is mitigated in a number of ways - players can re-roll once in each turn and they can collect helping cards when arriving on specific spaces or rolling a pentagram. The four quests are as follows:
- Library: find the book that opens a secret door to the secret passage. For this, find the same-colored book as the spaces you arrive on.
- Maze: to find your way through the maze, move the 5 moving pentagon tiles showing parts of the maze. These can be moved (turned or moved to different spaces) when rolling a pentagram or when arriving on a pentagon space. Cards might also help.
- Suspended bridge: each step (space) has some hidden traps that are revealed when stepping on them, easily causing players fall into the abyss. Some of them can be avoided with knowledge (knowing which blue owl has which number on its bottom), others with planning and luck (e.g. tiles where you fall into the abyss if you arrived there with specified die rolls), others with discarding a card. If a player falls into the abyss they have to climb back to the bridge and try again. The task gets easier once tiles are revealed and players know what to expect.
- The Five Owls: owls have to be placed on the five numbered spaces in order (the owl with number 1 to space 1 and so on). If a player fails they go back to the entrance of the owls hall. The numbers on the bottom of the owls can be looked at during game (with cards or when rolling a pentagram) but whenever they are checked (secretly, by the active player) they are placed back to another space so their location keeps changing and players must watch their movement closely during the course of the game.
The first player to correctly place the fifth owl to its corresponding place on the last space of the path wins.

Self-published game consisting of 96 word cards, a few blank cards and a couple of quick-reference cards. Each word card has 4 different words on it along with either a positive sign ( + ) or a negative sign ( - ). Words are articles, nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs. Different symbols correspond to the different parts of speech.

Everyone is dealt 10 cards face down (your personal pile) and players then draw 3 of those cards to form a hand. Remaining cards form a draw pile. On your turn, you may start a headline with a noun or article card, add a card to your headline (following normal sentence structure), add a card to someone else's headline (if you have a headline of your own started) or pass (and draw a card from the draw pile). If you use a card from your hand, you draw a card from your personal pile. Headlines must start with a noun or article and must contain at least 2 nouns and 1 verb. The headline is completed and set aside when the second noun is placed.

The round continues until a player runs out of cards from both their personal pile and their hand. Each player then scores their completed headlines. Incomplete headlines do not score any points. Subtract the number of negative cards from the number of positive cards in the headline. If the result is positive, this is your score. If the result is negative, take the absolute value as your score (e.g. you get 4 points for a score of -4).

The first player to reach a score of 10 wins the game. However, The primary purpose of RAG is to be entertaining. Many of the headlines will be funny. Some of them will be VERY funny! Enjoy the game and laugh a lot. Laughing is good for you!

Twoelk the hunter looked at Alyta and then at the portal at the far side of the vast hall. She, too, knew it was their one chance of getting home again.  The fog that rolled out of the portal had left stones in the fortress slick with dew, so the two of them approached it with caution.  According to what the avatar at the oracle had said, Urrick would be here, and he would be unbeatable without the aid of a spell caster.  That is why, as a sinister form began to take shape within the eldritch mists of the portal, Twoelks trepidation grew.  He slowly drew the magic arrow from his quiver, and glanced sideways at the amazon.  Alytas eyes were fixed on the portal and the terror within.  They could now discern the immense stature of the Rakshasa as it stepped through the vapors.  It was Urrick.

As the tiger-mans pale eyes narrowed on the two adventurers, he sneered.  He would enjoy eviscerating these foolish humans, and dining upon their entrails.  But before he could pounce upon his victims, an unseen force left him suspended in mid-leap.  It seemed the Twoelk and Alyta were equally stunned.  Now, my friends!  Strike now!  It was the voice of Brannig, whom they believed had been killed in the ruins south of the oracle.  Twoelk stammered, stymied.

- Easy to use charts and tables listing over one hundred different troop types, including historical leader ratings.

The Standard Rules are common to all four games.

Game scale is one mile per hex and 12 hours per game turn.  Unit sizes range from battalion to Brigade.  Design is a simple IGO-UGO sequence of play utilizing rigid Zones of Control and a differential based CRT.  Artillery units can participate in combat from non-adjacent hexes in attack and defense.

The games included in this quad are:


    Chinese Farm - covers the combat between the Israeli and Egyptian force around the Suez Canal, during the latter half of the Yom Kippur War, October 15 to 21, 1973.



    Wurzburg - (Hypothetical) A vital communications center, dominating the route of Soviet invasion into West Germany, which would be the site of a clash between Soviet Mechanized Rifle Divisions and the American Third Mechanized Infantry Division.



    Golan - On October 5, 1973, the Syrians launched an offensive with the objective of driving the Israelis off the Golan Heights.  They came close to success, but were eventually hammered back to the outskirts of Damascus.



    Mukden - (Hypothetical) Mukden is a great industrial center which lies at the edge of the vast Manchurian plain.  It would be a vital objective in a Soviet invasion, and would be hotly contested as the first threatened Chinese city.


A follow up set of four new games was later published as Modern Battles II: Four Contemporary Conflicts.

With additional 'credits' to: Tim Parsons; Stephen Stegelin; Chris Riley; Dan Harbison; EDITOR-Chester Jacques; PUBLISHER-Gary Reed; PLAYTESTERS-Todd Wartman as well as the many others previously listed; and SKYVERSE.
The LIST of 'artists' is as follows: Gary Barker, Leann Buckley, Andy Dimmitt, Jerry Foley, Gene Gonzales, Brad Gorby, Mark Hester, Don Hillsman, Quinton Hoover, Raff Ienco, Jake Jacobsen, Greg Land, Chris Leidenfrost, David Mack, Deon Nuckols, Sean Parsons, Willie Peppers, Steven Redinger, David Rowe, Kevin Sharpe, Brent Trammell, and Wayne Wong, as well some of the others already mentioned in the credits.

EACH Power CARDZ Starter Deck consists of 50-CARDs of 2-types: either Characters Cards OR Enhancement Cards and these have this denoted upon them, as well as a set of Rules for playing this. There is also a Power Scorecard sheet printed within this rules sheet, that needs to be enlarged and copied prior to gameplay. The Characters are also divided into HERO and VILLAIN Cards for simplicity's sake. Basically, you have 25-points for each Character, or object, and once these are exhausted, then that particular card is K.O.'d!

There was a means of obtaining a supplemental Power Scorecard, plus six Power Stones of various colors, as well as a checklist of the entire initial release-300 cards. These have a decidedly comic book look and feel in the components and gameplay, while being geared towards a generic approach for this so as not to impinge upon anyone's IP rights.

The game was really released twice with very different rules and many changes to the formatting of the cards.  The second release was based on input from Martin A. Stever.

You still push it back and forth over the table, but the unit keeps score, times the quarters, and even has voice and stadium sounds.

When you turn the unit on, lights will let you know who has possession of the 'ball'.  To score a touchdown, the unit has sensors underneath that will register when it goes over (but does not fall off) the edge of the table.  Each side has four downs to score a point before a turnover occurs.  It also has a special setting for field goal attempts.

The game comes with flat cardboard triangles for the footballs. What is cool is that each one has the name and logo of an actual NFL team. And yes, they made expansion packs so you could collect them all. It also comes with a very cool item, a field goal that you put together and stand up for when you attempt an extra point.

The game is played by two opponents stationed at opposite ends of a tabletop surface. The person who goes first flicks or slides the football toward the other end of the table. If it is touched by the opponent a field goal attempt is allowed for the flicker. Otherwise, a touchdown is made when part of the football rests over the edge of the table but doesn't fall off. Then an extra point can be attempted if a score is made. If a score is not made, the other person attempts to score, and so on until a winner is declared.

The game was first introduced in 1994.  The inaugural events which introduced the game were sponsored jointly by the NFL and Ocean Spray.

Tournaments were established around the country at thousands of Universities, with a grand prize package at stake for a team of four to attend the Superbowl with all expenses paid.

Each player starts with money, and cards representing (generic) superstars in the four sports. As players move around the board, they pay payrolls, collect gate receipts, and can get new superstars from the bank, through auction, or by acquiring them from other players.

Certain board spaces (or a roll of doubles) trigger a championship round in the currently-active sports season. Championships are resolved by each player rolling as many dice as they have superstars in the currently-active sport (which of course also moves the game into the next season). The championship victor gets a 2-D plastic trophy, and a monetary bonus.

The winner is the first to win 3 championships in any one sport, or 2 championships in each of  2 sports.

It is played on an 18 x 14 board. Both players have a set of 8 hierarchically ordered animal pieces (elephant, polar bear, tiger, lion, wolf, dog, cat, mouse) and 2 humans (woman and man).
Bigger animals win against smaller animals, with two exceptions: The mouse beats the elephant, and the dog beats the polar bear.
Humans are the weakest pieces; they lose against any animal.
To win, you have to either cross the board with one of your humans, or eliminate one of the opponent's humans.
Play is card-driven. For each piece (animal or human) there are 9 cards with values 1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5. There's also an identical set of joker cards, which can be used for any of the pieces.
Players choose their cards from a hand of 7, one per turn, to move the corresponding piece.

There's a page dedicated to Fauna

To win, a team must get six links in a row- horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

The twist is that all teams move the same yellow marker around the edges of the board through the use of movement cards and brain pills (bonus cards gotten by answering questions correctly).  A team can ONLY attempt to answer a trivia question on a square that is in the same row or column as the yellow marker.  However, the yellow marker itself can be used to complete a row of six for the win!

The four corner spaces that have special powers: remove an opponent's token, place a free token, move any token, or attempt to answer a question on any square.

The trivia categories are: Business, Entertainment, Geography, History, Sports, Science, Potluck, and Oddball (you must figure out what trait 3 of the 4 items listed share in common).

It's Trivial Pursuit with a Go-Moku win mechanic and a dash of Pueblo added in.

16236,Tops and Tails,1964,2.75,4,0,1,4,0,0,,Card Game Humor Puzzle ,Card DraftingPattern BuildingSet Collection,"From the box:

Rules for Several Players:

Shuffle the cards well, and deal them out equally, face downwards. If any player finds he has a complete matching picture in his hand he can lay it down immediately, face upwards. Matching halves bear the same number.
The player on the right of the dealer begins by laying one card down, face upwards. If the next player has the card to match it, he puts it down and takes the complete picture, counting it as a set in his favor. If he has not got the matching card he can put down any other card to make whatever funny combination he likes. However, only a top can be laid to a tail, or vice versa, as two tops or two tails cannot be put together. If a player has not the type of card required, he loses his turn to the next player. The winner is the player with most complete sets at the end of the game.

Rules for One Player:

Shuffle the cards well and lay them out face downwards in pairs, in such a way that the design on the backs of each pair forms a complete picture. Then turn the cards face upwards one by one. The resulting comical combinations will give a lot of amusement. If any of the pairs of cards you have laid out forms a matching pair (a set), place them on one side, face upwards, then shuffle the remaining cards and repeat the process until all the matching pairs have been found.
You can take as long as an hour to play this game, and will always get different combinations.

A piece may move to any square that can be reached by a sequence of one-square horizontal and vertical moves where the maximum number of vertical moves is the number of white pins in the piece and the maximum number of horizontal moves the number of black pins. (A piece with no pins cannot move)

A piece may not move through a square occupied by another piece of either color. To take an opponent's piece a player moves to that square and removes it.

As the captains of Viking boats, the players sail from island to island and load barrels - either from the island or from an opponent's boat that happens to be moored there. The goal is to be the first player to bring a certain number of barrels back to his home island. On a player's turn, he rolls three coloured dice. They decide how many islands further his boat may sail - but it's different than what many players are used to. If the player's own colour is rolled, then his movement is reduced by one. If he has barrels on board, then none of those colours may be rolled either. The more colourful the load, the greater the chance of not moving very far and losing the load instead. An innovative idea.

The decimation of their fleets also forced the contraction of their outer boundaries. Fearing that hostilities would be resumed before they could rebuild their fleets, the empires mutually agreed to bar all warships heavier than a cruiser from these liberated or abandoned (depending on your viewpoint) areas. Spontaneously the deserters, criminals, and other opportunists rose to fill this void. By preying on commercial ships and providing availability to now unobtainable or illegal items, they amassed great fortunes and others died in poverty or on the gallows.

War of the Star Slavers is a simulation of these violent times. As an empire player you must protect your commerce and prevent unrest among your populace so that you can rebuild your fleets. You must also protect yourself against the other empire as it is in his interest to see your economy fall apart as much as it is to defeat you on the field of battle.

The Slaver players must amass a fortune and retire before they are apprehended. The Slaver must pay for fuel, his crew, repairs on his ship, etc.

In other words every turn costs him money, but he can obtain large amounts of money by dealing in contraband or illegal acts. The greater the chance he takes the greater his return will be.

You can make any deals you like with whomever you choose. Anything you can get away with is valid. No act is too vile, no deal too dishonest.

Golf Tiddlywinks

A Game of Fun  Dexterity

Golf Tiddlywinks is a challenging game of skill based on an original table-top board game from the 1920s. It was designed as a celebration of golf, the 'Royal and Ancient' game that was hugely popular with affluent 'bright young things' whose world is reflected in novels by Evelyn Waugh, Nancy Mitford and P.G. Wodehouse

Play begins once each player has selected a colour counter and the order of play has been decided. Each player takes it in turn to place his counter on the starting point and flip it once towards Flag 1. When it is his turn again, the player flips his counter towards the first 'hole' from wherever it is on the board after his previous attempt. To complete the 'hole', a player's countermust come to rest on the white circle of a flag, but is not necessary for it to cover the whole of the space. When a player's counter touches the white circle and completes a 'hole' it can be flipped agian towards the next flag. The winner is the first player to reach Flag 16, the final 'hole' of the Golf Tiddlywinks course.

A counter that comes to rest on an opponent's counter must go back three 'holes'. Counters that land in a bunker or lake are returned to the start, from where the player must try to reach the Flag that was his goal before he encountered the hazard. Counters that leave the board entirely are returned to the start, from where, after missing a turn, the player must try to reach the Flag that was previously his goal.

For up to 4 players aged 3 years and over

Schatzsuche: Das Erbe des Seewolfs (Treasure Hunt: The Inheritance of the Sea Wolf) is an exciting treasure hunt for children invented by Klaus Zoch. A brave little wolf is on the search for booty. Gold coins and jewelry get added to Wolfi's as well as his young helpers' possessions when they manage to accumulate as many pairs of identical island- and treasure-cards as possible. But the Devil is in the details: Two of the beautifully-illustrated cards, although they may appear identical at first glance, are actually different upon closer inspection. Guessing wrong impacts Wolfi's treasure hunt: the goods have to be returned. The winner at the end of the adventure is the person who has managed to accumulate the most treasure. An extra dose of excitement is afforded by the little pirates that challenge each other to guessing contests.

While waking up (at about 8pm), Lulu and Dd decide to go to the party in the village hall of Saint-Andre-le-Gaz. They intend to get there before Nono and Kiki, who also go out only at 8pm because they were playing Playstation all the afternoon

The 4 characters go through the countryside, at feet or by train, trying to get to the village hall but on the way long, they may meet pals. Those never fail to invite our guys to drink a glass of beer, or to smoke weed. They never refuse an invitation (theyre no beasts).

Nevertheless, each one will be careful not to arrive too drunk at the festival in order to have a chance of getting chicks It would also be better to bring flowers but as all the florists are closed down at this time, it will be necessary to find some on the road.

The game includes two map boards (beginning and advanced) and also includes a plastic divider.

The divider is similar to those used in navigation except this one is fixed and cannot be adjusted. The player places one of the points of the divider in the start hole. The divider is then rotated until a hole matching the radius of the divider is found. There are multiple hole at this radius. One of the holes is chosen and the other point of the divider is rotated until another hole is found and chosen. This continues alternating points of the divider until the goal is reached.

An interesting solo game that seems more like a puzzle. Re-playability is somewhat limited as there are only two different boards.

The game could be extended to multiple players by keeping track of the number of times that the divider points are placed in new holes. The player with the fewest number wins.

At the start of the game each player secretly selects eight items, represented by nicely illustrated cards, of the sixteen different antiques available (the deck includes three of each type) recording these on a score pad.  Each item is likely to have a different value, representing the resale value for each player.  The object therefore is to purchase as many of the selected items as possible for less than the resale price.

Players take it in turns to auction the cards.  The progress of each auction is unusual in being determined by die rolls. The auctioneer rolls a die to establish the reserve. The next player in rotation can either roll again, the value shown being added to the reserve price or drop out.  This continues until only one player remains in the bidding. The cost of the item is then the sum of all the die rolls!

Items other than the eight may be purchased but  at the game end they will represent a loss there is no resale value) and at any point a player may offer an item or items for sale at a price to be negotiated.
The game continues until one player has accumulated his or her
portfolio of eight items, the game ends immediately and all players calculate their profits.

The largest profit wins.

Beginning in February, 1958 Castro began the first Guerrilla offensive by coming out of the Sierra Maesta Mountains and attacking the Bastiano troops in the plains. The Bastiano army counterattacked driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains beginning in June 1958. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the guerrillas, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Batista fled in January 1959, the guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was finally free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.

The Cuban Revolution uses area movement and a simple and easy-to-learn combat system. Learning the game takes minutes and about 1-2 hours of playing time at most.

The cheering Mexican soldiers, along with the accompanying bugle call of the Deguello, soon betrayed the surprise attack. Within an hour and a half, the entire garrison of 182 to 225 volunteers had been put to the sword, and General Santa Anna had won his victory at the cost of some 311 of his brave officers and soldiers. Even more, he created an American myth that began with the Deguello at Dawn

Dennis Bishop uses area movement, facing, ranged fire and melee combat to recreate this famous event in American History. Leaders play a big role in the game and rules for Col. James Bowie to determine if he's healthy and able to take part in the battle.

A unique twist on casualties is also used as the game has a large map (17 x 22) and uses over 400 double sided unit counters (some that are 1 x ) as well as about 8-10 pages of rules and various game player aids.

Deguello at Dawn was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.

The object of the game is to complete a round trip through the Solar System by drawing ten planet cards in their proper order. (The order will be unfamiliar, though, as it goes Earth - Saturn - Jupiter - Mars - Uranus - Neptune - Venus - Mercury - Earth). Each card features well executed art done in a style similar to golden age science fiction pulp magazines.

The game consists of two identical decks with cards numbered 1-10. These cards represent round trips the the Solar System, starting with Take Off (Card 1) and ending with Landing On Earth (Card 10). Players take a deck and shuffle it, then place it before them. The first player draws a card. If it is Take Off (Card 1), they place it in front of them and draw the next card. If the next card is a planet but not Card 2, they discard it in a discard pile next to their original pile and draw again, until they draw a card that says Next player goes. The next player takes a turn, and draws until they get a Next player goes card. Chance cards such as lost on the moon, Sputnik, and Danger--Comets can affect a player's turn.

Players may draw from either pile, so there is a memory element, as you must remember which pile your next planetary target was in.

All cards must be discarded in the pile next to the pile from which they were drawn.

The goal is to collect all 10 cards, in sequence.

Rules list a variant for three or more players through using multiple copies of the game.

Each player is dealt a hand of seven cards, each with a basketball event such as slam dunk, blocked shot, free throw, and rebound.

When a player plays all seven of their cards, he gets a seven point bonus, everyone tallies their scores and a new hand is dealt. Play continues until the end of the game and the player with the most points from completed rounds is the winner.

The game idea, invented by Reiner Knizia, is very simple but tense. The 28 large Rizzi art cards have values between 0 and 6; each of the two players receives twelve. On a player's turn, they must discard a card from their hand. To discard, a player must either create a new discard pile or place the card on an existing discard pile - but in that case, the value of the card must be exactly one higher than the card onto which it is to be placed. If there are already three discard piles on the table, then a player has no choice but to discard to one of the piles. If he can't, then he has lost the round and receives as many glass beads as cards left in his hand. The first player to get six glass beads is the loser.

James Rizzi is part of the Kosmos two-player series.

As of 2006 -- It appears that this game may never have been published.

Paul and Paula are the fastest pizza deliverers around. Their good reputation is influenced by the fact that pizzas occasionally slip out of their hands. Clumsiness? Nope! Paul and Paula can simply only deliver pizzas that they are magnetically attracted to. Pizzas of the wrong pole rebuff Paul and Paula. The two of them need a little help. Someone will surely remember which pizzas the two of them should be delivering. The game includes a round wooden game board that looks like a pizza with an arrow spinner in the middle, nine magnetic pizza pieces and two magnetic figures. The two figures, Paul and Paula, have different poles (positive and negative) to ensure that they are never attracted to the same pizza. The spinner determines which figure a player, on their turn, may hold over a pizza piece. If they choose correctly, the pizza, with a click, fastens itself to the figure. The winner is the player who owns three pizza pieces first.

Players each have the following pieces: one king, one queen, and two pawns. They may setup their pieces as they want on the first rank of their side of the board.

It's probably better if players alternately setup one of their pieces, with the kings deployed last. Using a screen in the middle of the board behind which the pieces can be set up secretly may also be an idea, but poses both practical difficulties.

King and Queen move as in orthodox chess.

Pawns have the usual moves of chess, but may also move diagonally.

The stock prices are affected by news and rumors that randomly occur throughout the course of the game. There are two types of news and rumors that occur: Market News and Rumors affect the entire market; and Company News and Rumors which only affect a given individual company. Although rumors occur at random; how long they remain alive can be strategically predicted. The longer a rumor remains alive the higher the chance it will be confirmed or dispelled on the next turn. Consequently, players must trade accordingly; they must decide on 4 Criteria: [1] Buy or Sell?; [2]Which Stock to Trade?; [3] How many Shares to Trade?; and most importantly [4] When to Trade?.

COMMODITIES [MAINLY GOLD] . . .

The Stock Rush name was inspired by the California Gold Rush of 1849. As a result, a significant portion of the game is dedicated to that historical event. Players randomly mine for Gold and participate in many Gold Rushes throughout the game. During a Gold Rush players may become trapped in a Cave In.  Trapped players may escape on their own or be rescued by other players.  
Once players accumulate Gold they may strategically sell any amount they wish on the Gold Exchange Market. They must sell according to 3 Criteria:
[1] How much Gold to Sell? [2] At What Price to Sell? [3] When to Sell?  The other commodities in the game are Groceries, Toys, Clothes and Gearthe STUFF we use in our everyday life.

If they cannot come up with a letter the card goes to the next player on the left, who now has to think of a proper word. If the player finds a suitable word, he moves to the next letter.

This game consists of rolling and moving around the board collecting things that are supposed to tell us about Africa (coconuts, tree, necklace, fish, mask, drum, hut...). Each player has a board with pictures of 9 of the 16 objects to be collected and rolls the die to move around the board and fill up her or his board. The only further 'complication' is that there are some arrow squares on the board, some pointing clockwise, some anticlockwise. It would appear that landing on these squares can change the direction the player is going in. Landing on any other square gets one of the objects, if its one the player needs.

16451,The Emerald Tablet,1977,6.33333,3,0,2,2,120,120,,Fantasy Miniatures Wargame ,Dice RollingSimultaneous Action Selection,"Wargaming Rules for Heroic Battles and Mystical Conquests.

A comprehensive (56 pages) set of miniatures rules for conducting warfare in a fantasy setting. Both combat and magic are used to resolve battles. The rules are designed for standard 25mm miniatures, but guidance is also given for playing with 15mm miniatures.

The rules comprehensiveness is readily apparent: almost every aspect of any epic fantasy battle in any story ever published in any century is covered. Really. Behold a random sampling from the rules' index:


     Ceremonial Magic
     Bombards
     Metamorphoids
     Sacrificial Victims 
     Chariots
     Oblique movement of self-disciplined units
     Rules for innate chi projection
     Killing rampaging large mounts
     Infernal Engine Disadvantages   
     Unconscious and mad magic users
     Aerial unit fatigue
     Goetic Magic Hour Correspondence Charts
     Effects of routing units on dray animals
     Klipothic and Beneficient Magic


The rules' color text claims that the magic system is based on the actual grimoires (magical texts) that guided medieval European thaumaturges (workers of miracles). Cardstock sheets are designed to be cut into individual spell cards marked with evocation circles, mystical symbols, demons and angels that have been familiar to magic users for centuries. It is hard to judge the historical accuracy of such statements, but the book is packed with so many spell charts, Astral Force cards, magic critical fail results, and the affects of High Magic Color rules that Merlin would probably sell his left one for just one peek at the last 30 pages of the book.

Across the Pacific portrays the entire Pacific War in five-month turns with units that range from armies to regiments, air fleets to destroyer flotillas. The game system is interactive so that each player is involved at every moment of play. The heart of the game's mechanics is a series of strategic and tactical phases  5 per player per turn  that are sequenced by a chit draw so that each player will know his and his opponents possible actions, but not the order in which they will be undertaken. This brings about continual strategic and operational opportunity as players plan their actions in response to the lifting for of war.

Across the Pacific provides a manageable and fast-paced wargame that has a high level of detail and operational flavor while retaining the strategic scope of the ebb and flow of the Pacific War

Across the Pacific contains:

Or in the cupboard? Whoever tells the right number, can save a little kid from being caught by the wicked wolf. This memory game for 2 - 4 players contains a variant for younger players as well as the fairy tale to re-read.

There are six metal cups in different colors. At the start of the game, five wooden goat's heads are placed under each of them, and the wolf is placed in the middle of a ring of cups. The players take turns to roll a color die, then announce how many goat heads are under the cup in the corresponding color. When an announcement is correct, the player gets one head and hides the rest under the cup again.
When an announcement is wrong, the player gets the wolf and keeps it until another player guesses wrongly. But when the player who already has the wolf announces a wrong number, he or she has to dump one goat to the wolf.

The game ends when either one player has collected seven heads (and thus wins) or the wolf has six (and thus all players lose).

Module Change introduces coins into the game. When overpaying for a building, players now get partial change back in coins, which you can use as normal money cards.

With the module The Thieves, thief cards are dealt to players in the beginning. The thieves allow players to take available money cards out of turn.

With the module The Walls, wooden walls become available. Players can extend their city walls or close existing holes with them. To build walls, a player must first get an appropriate wall card from the money deck.

With the module The Traveling Merchant, buildings in Alhambra begin to get populated by meeples! The new residents give extra points during the scoring rounds. To get the residents, players must do a little planning ahead with their city layout by using merchant tiles.

Three games may be played...

The Winning Team: Four cards are dealt to each player and face-up on the table. On your turn, if you can match a card from your hand to a card on the table, you take both cards and place them face-up in a pile in front of you. If you can match a card to the top card on an opponent's pile, you may take the player's entire pile of cards. When no more plays can be made, the player with the most cards wins.

Sport Snap: The deck is dealt out evenly among the players. All players simultaneously turn over their top card. If no cards match, turn over another card. If two or more cards match, the first player to call out a correct matching sport wins all stacks with that card on top. If you make a wrong call, you must give 1 card to each opponent. The player that wins all the cards wins the game.

Spoons: Spoons are placed in the center of the table (one less than the number of players). Each player gets 4 cards. The dealer draws a card and either keeps it or passes it to the next player who also can either keep it or pass it etc. As soon as you have a complete set of 4 cards, take a spoon. All players then grab for the remaining spoons. The player who doesn't get one receives a letter - first an S, followed by a P, O, O, and finally an N. When one player has spelled out SPOON the game ends and the player with the least number of letters wins.

Who is the film buff and who knows most about beer? Who is the sports freak of the party and who is Mr(s). Know-it-all? Maybe there's a talented sketch-artist or actor in the room. If you are blessed with all these talents, or you are just plain lucky, you stand a high chance to become 'Master of the Game'.

Play the Grolsch Master Game and test yourself. Play, roll the dice and become 'Master of the Game'.

Aim of the Game:
Try to reach the finish first with your swing-top bottle, pay the bill and win the game.

Gameplay synopsis With your swing-top bottle you travel from start to finish. Along the way you need to answer various questions or fulfill assignments. But watch out! Every ring brings you closer to the finish, but the questions and assignments become more difficult too. You go from one ring to the next via the doorman ar an open door. But... you don't reach the finish that easily. First you will need to make sure that you have paid your bill. With the beer voucher you won, you can pay the innkeeper. You win these vouchers by correctly answering the questions or fulfilling the assignments.

The Grolsch Master game is a promotional game from the Dutch brewery Grolsch, world famous (in the Netherlands) for it's swing-top bottles. The game is a party game that combines aspects of Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary, Charades etc.

The Trivia questions are divided into the categories Film, Beer, Sports and Various, each category containing 50 cards of 4 questions with increasing difficulty. The question you are asked depends on the ring you are in, the closer to the center, the more difficult the question should be. There are also 150 'the Pub' cards with 4 assignments that require you to draw, impersonate, act out or imitate persons, animals situations or even your thoughts on a particular matter (that you have written down beforehand). A sixth set of cards (30 brewery cards) are comparable to the 'Chance' cards of Monopoly.

You roll the die to determine the number of steps you have to take (you can decide whether you travel clockwise or counter clockwise), and depending on the square you land upon, you need to answer a question or carry out an assignment, you can get to the next ring or you get to draw a 'Brewery' (Chance) card. If you answer a question correctly, you get a beer voucher, otherwise you have to pay a beer voucher. If one of the other players guesses your assignment correctly, both get a beer voucher.

There a two possibilities to get to the next ring: via an open door, or via a doorman. The doorman requires payment in the form of beer vouchers. When you reach the final ring, you need to have enough beer vouchers to pay your bill. The first player reaching the inner circle wins the game.

The rules are able to be modified for younger players.  Older children will find the hard level questions on the Question cards to be a challenge though.  A good knowledge of the Bible, or Bible stories is a large plus for this game.  Scripture references are given on the cards too.

There are also Action cards that will give the player either rewards to help them along or setbacks that will hinder the journey along the board.

The books the game is based around (The Book and The Book for Children) aren't translated version of the Bible, but are easier to read the paraphrasing of the translations to help make the passages and stories easier to understand.

It is the first Gandy Dancer game featuring the hauling of commodities.

As in the prior two Gandy Dancer releases, players earn money by making runs with their railroads and by buying and selling shares on the stock market. Players take turns investing in railroads and using those railroads to ship goods in this acquisition race.

Insider Trading has the added features of hauling commodities for additional profits, and as its name indicates, manipulating the stock market by using insider knowledge.  But don't get caught up in a scandal or it will cost you dearly.

Players start with a stock portfolio of $100 and some cash (the amount varies depending upon the number of players). In turn, a player may play a movement card, roll a die or pay to move around the gameboard. The space on which a player lands may allow that player to buy and stock in a railroad, use that railroad for shipping, draw and trade commodity cards (sets of which can result in big rewards) and draw insider trading cards (these allow stock manipulation). There are penalty spaces but these can only be landed on because of a die roll.

The game ends when one railroad has hauled one load of each of six commodity groups or when one player goes bankrupt. The player with the most money is the winner.

The challenge is to see which player, including Ken, is able to reach $2.6 million (the amount Jennings actually won on Jeopardy!) in prize money first.

The game is unique in that we actually tested Ken with all 1,200 questions, [University Games spokesman Alex] Plant said, although neither he nor Jennings could recall how many of the game's questions Jennings actually answered correctly.

Ken may have gotten some right and some wrong and we recorded how he answered each question on the card itself, Plant said. That allows players to see how they held up against the Jeopardy! whiz.

How to play:  Each player selects a neighborhood map card and holds it in his or her hand.  The remaining map cards are set aside.

The dealer shuffles the neighborhood place cards and deals five cards face-down to each player.  The remaining cards in the deck are placed face-down in a pile.  The dealer draws the top card and lays it face-up to begin the discard pile.

The first player picks up a card from either the deck or the discard pile.  If the card matches an item on his or her neighborhood map card, the player keeps the card and discards an unwanted card.  If the card does not match, the player places it face-up on the discard pile.

Players take turns picking up and discarding cards.  When all cards have been drawn from the deck, the discard pile is reshuffled to start a new pile.

The first player to collect five of the places displayed on his or her neighborhood map card wins the game!

16596,Jetan,1922,6.9,12,4,2,2,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"Jetan, or Martian Chess, is a two-player abstract game played on a 10-by-10 board.  Each side has a set of twenty pieces of varying types, with each type having its own set of movement options.

The game is unlike traditional Chess in a few important respects: 
All pieces in Jetan have limited movement (i.e. the Chief moves three spaces in any direction or combination of directions).
One piece on each side (the Princess) cannot capture other pieces.
The conditions for a win or a draw (described below) are unusual.

The game is won when a player places any of his pieces on the same square with his opponent's Princess, or when a Chief takes a Chief. It is drawn when a Chief is taken by any opposing piece other than the opposing Chief; or when both sides have been reduced to three pieces, or less, of equal value, and the game is not terminated in the following ten moves... -- from Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel The Chessmen of Mars.

It bears the subtitle The Game of Space War in Star Trek in addition to the less generic Invasion of Klingon Empire.

This is definitely a strategic game, given the 4-part mounted map showing the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire (or a portion thereof), the Romulan Empire (ditto), and a large amount of space between these.  Production is clearly important, as there seem to be many rules sections covering factories.

The game definitely appears to have two sides, the Federation and the Klingons.  It gives the appearance of allowing either 2 or 4 players - the map has a line down the middle which would split it reasonably enough for this purpose.  Presumably two players split the Federation and the other side has a Klingon and a Romulan player.

The missions of the USS Enterprise are clearly of some importance to the game.  The green lines on the map appear to chart these (many of the systems have names familiar from the original TV series), there is a rules section labeled ST Game Enterprise Mission Chart, and one of the scenarios is called Missions of Enterplize (I swear!).  Other missions include la Brandy de Camus and a campaign game.

It is a small strategic boardgame for two players that can be best described as a combination of Chess and Memory with a 16th century feudal Japan theme added to the mix.
The story is that two Daimyos are discussing a battle they once fought, during a tea ceremony (the discussion, not the battle). The problem is that both Daimyos don't have very good memories. They try to remember how the battle developed and who won eventually.

As mentioned, the basic mechanics of the game are a combination of Chess and Memory. Finding combinations of identical cards on the board results in new units, which act as chess pieces. Hence, good memory and some tactical insight may be of good use in playing this game.

Bio One will prove an interesting addition to any set of man-to-man rules which uses gun fire . . .

Its a variation of the card based trivia theme in which players pit their wits against Jim, the Royle Family's fountain of all knowledge and have to decide if facts on the trivia cards are Sound (true) or My Arse (false.)

Here's how the marketing material describes it:

A classic game of truth or bluff, you have to choose the facts from the guff...decide whether Jim really knows his onions or is simply full of hot air.

Do you agree with Jim and head for a pint at the Feathers or grumble your way to the kitchen to brew another cuppa?

Of one thing you can be certain...you're in for a right Royle battle in this off-beat trivia board game.

With 5 cards to each family, there are cards for the father, wife, son, daughter and the family symbol.

Cards are shuffled and dealt evenly to all players.  Each player in turn freely asks any player for a specific card, if that player has the card asked for, the player must give that card to the person asking.  Play continues for the asking player until the person asked does not have the card asked for and the turn goes to the next player.

Once a set of Family cards is collected it is laid on the table and retired from play (scoring no points for the player).  The object is to be the player that lays down the last Family set

A twist in the mechanics of the game adds fun to the gameplay.  Anytime a card is given to a player, the receiver must say Thank You, if the receiver fails to do so, the first person to say Duster receives all of the cards from the person that neglected to say Thank You.  The person receiving the cards must in turn say Thank You or is subject to the same Duster rule.

The person that did not say Thank You and lost all of their cards can not be spoken to.

The object of this racing trivia game is to be the first past the chequered flag at the end of an agreed number of between 1  11 laps.

Movement around the circuit depends on answering some pretty tough motorsport questions.  Get the answer right and your foot is on the accelerator, get it wrong and you are going backwards!

Though (motoring) trivia based there are many variables which can improve or reduce your chances of winning: The circuit itself is tortuous so keeping to the racing line is essential.  Hazard and weather cards, which can turn the track into a skid-pan make life interesting so choice of tires is critical, as is choice of fuel.

Game Contents:-
1 x playing board
1 x blue dice
1 x red dice
6 x coloured lap counters
6 x coloured racing helmets
388 x motorsport cards
12 x tyre cards
1 x set of red rocket fuel tokens
1 x set of blue fuel tokens
1 x lap counter board
1 x rules sheet

The box notes describe this game as a fast action game of skill, strategy, and racing knowledge.

You need a very good general knowledge of motorsport to enjoy this game to the full, but the rules include a shorter, faster version of the game can be played by using only the hazard cards and no questions, making game-play much less difficult.

Sign It! the board game is an interactive new way of learning and practicing American Sign Language (ASL). It is designed to be fun and educational.

Sign It! was born out of necessity. The creator is a 50 year old cabinet maker with a progressive hearing loss. While taking ASL classes, he searched in vain for a teaching tool to help him and his wife practice ASL and increase their vocabularies, and subsequently developed Sign It! to fill this need.

The Sign it! board game which includes a board a rule booklet and markers for six players, provides instruction for learning 824 signs. The game also comes with a copy of Signing Illustrated :The complete learning Guide, a 258 page illustrated and indexed reference book.

Sign It! contains a set of cards (which cover more than eight categories), a rule booklet, one die and markers for six players.

The game is setup reminiscent of Trivial Pursuit, with color coded squares.Each person gets a token (I was the elephant) then rolls the die. As expected,what ever the number you rolled...that's the number of spaces you moved. The color of the square is the color you look at on the card. Then you sign that word.

Colors are categories such as feelings, communication, locations, and more.On the card next to the words are page numbers for the accompanying book where you can find the appropriate sign. The game can be purchased with the reference book, Signing Illustrated by Mickey Flodin, which includes well drawn illustration, clear directions and even little reminder hints to help you remember new signs.

The board depicts the classic demon-summoning layout, with pentagram and magic circle.  One player is the wizard, the other, the demon; both are armed with tokens, two for each ancient element (earth, air, water, fire).  The wizard plays first, setting up his elements hidden at the points of the triangle and pentagram with no opposing element on the same line.  The demon plays second, laying down one element at a time next to the wizard's and seeing what happens before playing the next.  The idea is that the wizard should create a difficult-to-guess defense, while the demon tries to solve the puzzle and/or hedge his bets.

AirWar: C21 Lite is a cut down version of the second edition of AirWar: C21, our popular fast play, entry level set of rules for dogfights set in the years after WW2, and for near future SF games. The rules use a quasi 3D manoeuvre system, whereby the action is fought out in 2D, but with some representation of 3D air combat manoeuvres.

The Lite version is intended to give you the basics of the game and allow you the opportunity to try out some dogfights using the AirWar: C21 system between US F-14 D Tomcats and Russian Su-27 Flanker Bs.

Player notes:

A hexless tabletop miniatures game with each miniature representing a single aircraft. The system breaks game turns into two phases, with each aircraft moving  attempting a manoeuvre in each phase. Turn summary (edited from PDF):

Phase 1
 Select and apply engine power speed changes (unless stalled)
 Roll for initiative, conduct radar/visual spotting
 Move (if turning, move half the aircraft Speed, turn, and move the second half)
 Test for and execute all movement or manoeuvres in order of initiative
 Resolve effects of any missiles launched last phase
 Launch new missiles
 Resolve air-to-air gun or rocket attacks
 Resolve speed changes due to manoeuvre or stall recovery
Phase 2
 identical to Phase 1

Tests for manoeuvres vary in difficulty, making a Barrel Roll easier than an Immelman, etc.

The system uses multiple D6  D10, single die rolls for tests, detection, etc, multiple for damage. Speed, damage  currently carried weapons are the only variables during play, but each aircraft  weapon has many values to record before starting. Although simplified from the full rules, the system includes a large variety of factors to simulate air warfare, with only the lack of altitude tracking being a notable abstraction.

Only statistics for the F14 Tomcat  Su27 Flanker and their weapons are included in the Lite rules.

Damage results in critical hits, which limit or eliminate ship systems or wear the starcraft down until structure failure occurs. Rules allow players to form squadrons, then fight a series of individual battles or a linked campaign. Background material (optional) details six human empires and one alien power.

The Game's Components consists of the following:
'56'-page rulebook (includes record forms)
'4'-(four) 11 x 17 mapsheets (black with hexgrid)
'2'-(two) countersheets (counters must be cut out)
The game includes a rule book with rules for both Basic and Standard games. Two full-color countersheets are included along with a hex-map so that you can start playing immediately. Dice are not included. Three 6-sided dice and one 10-sided die are required for the Basic game, while the Standard game requires one 4-sided die, three 6-sided dice, one 8-sided die, one 10-sided die and one 12-sided die.
The rulebook contains 21 pre-designed fighters, each associated with one or more of the political entities of the 37th century. Although an official set of miniatures is available, these rules are suitable for use with any space fighter models of appropriate size.

Folding Game Board, Set of 6 Dogs, set of DOG cards, set of FORM cards, betting chips for 8 players, race meeting cards and instructions.

Publisher's Description:

Its a gamble! Study the form (different for each race), check the odds (favorites don't always win) and place your bets! Betting chips are provided so you don't have to bet with real money.

Fortunes to be won or lost! By studying the odds you may have more chance of winning -but, just as in real life, the outsiders can take the race -so a lucky name or number, a whim or a fancy, can sometimes serve you just as well!

The Dogs run against the turn of a set of specially formulated cards which automatically adjust the odds and form, which is determined before every race, so that the outcome of each race is as predictable (and unpredictable) as in the real world of dog racing.

Each race lasts around 5-8 minute. There are 10 races per card but you can play as many races as you like as each is excitingly different and unpredictable.

This really is an exciting game and you don't know the outcome of each race until the last card is played!

Brief Notes:

Fast and interesting wagering game. Since you can play as many races as you want, it can be as quick as 10 minutes, or an all evening game if you wish.

Welcome to the Defiance Universal Skirmish System, the game of near future and science fiction tactical combat that lets you modify or even create the strategic setting in which your battles will take place. With force sizes varying from one unit to several platoons, each trooper matters, and the correct combination of mobility, firepower, command and control is crucial to your success.

The U.S.S. Army Customizer is a comprehensive and statistically based force construction tool that literally allows you to design any weapon, any trooper and any army that you can imagine, all the while being assured that your creation will be balanced for play against any other U.S.S. force list. A lot of work and testing went into the Customizer, and we feel that you will not find a more versatile or more balanced universal force construction tool on the market today.

The 128-page rulebook contains the necessary rules and army lists to allow players to take part in the battles for the Milky Way. Control the ground forces of one of 5 different empires, all jockeying for supremacy in the new power vacuum that the Starslayers have created:


     The Vobian Empire, vast and ancient, which utilizes high-tech weaponry and cybernetic beasts to even the odds against its former subjects.
     The Tamerlane Khanate, progeny of the last great Mongol Empire, which still clings to a tribal past, despite the urgings of its human neighbors.
     The Ka-yi Sultanate, Perseus heir to the Ottoman Empire, which struggles against religious and political tradition to form a united Human Confederacy.
     The Nordic Alliance, descendants of the army of Gustavus Adolphus, who have used ingenuity and military know-how to overcome their limitations and become galactic players.
     The Meraxillan Empire, ever evolving, which cares only for its own expansion at the expense of all others.


This book contains rules which cover almost every tactical situation, including troop quality, command and control, army discipline, indirect and suppression fire, vehicles from mecha to armored personnel carriers, and more. Also included is the Starslayer Troop Builder, a complete and statistically-balanced troop construction tool that allows you to convert virtually any figure to the Starslayer rules system.

16754,The Maple Leaf Forever,2002,6,1,0,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Expansion for Base-game Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"From the Rules Introduction:

The Maple Leaf Forever is an expansion set to Brain Train's War Plan: Crimson. The Maple Leaf Forever tries to integrate the Canadian plans to counter the American invasion of Canada as outlined in Sutherland Buster Brown's (I'm not making this up) Defense Scheme No. 1. All the rules of War Plan Crimson are used except where noted below. Gamers will note that The Maple Leaf Forever does not interfere with War Plan Crimson, but rather adds a section to the beginning of the game (usually four or five extra turns) which represents the days before the American invasion. It was this period that Buster Brown calculated would be critical, if Canada was to resist an American invasion.

16756,Trampling Out the Vintage,1999,6.75,4,0,2,2,0,0,Wargames,American Civil War Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"From the publisher's webpage:

In 1864 General Sherman's march to Atlanta faced the heart of Dixie with the prospect of bloody fighting such as had already devastated large swathes of the Confederacy. And yet, despite a superiority in men and material, his task was a daunting one. Tied to the single-line of the Western and Atlantic Railroad for supply, and marching through a wilderness, Sherman could not afford to run up a huge butcher's bill. A too bloody summer's victory in Northern Georgia could easily result in a November defeat for President Lincoln in the forthcoming general election. On the other side General Johnston, commanding the defending Army of Tennessee, was no less vexed. He had attempted to whip his flagging forces into shape, despite sagging morale and a lack of reinforcements, but he knew this was a battle he could not afford to lose. Only reluctantly appointed to command by President Davis, Johnston would also be hamstrung by a divided and uncooperative staff.

Trampling out the Vintage is a simulation of the 1864 campaign for Atlanta. Both players maneuver and fight their units in an interactive sequence of play that places a premium on planning and decision making. Can you as General Sherman present the city of Atlanta to President Lincoln in a time and manner that will hasten the end of the war and ensure a second term for the Republican administration? Or, as General Johnston, can you stave off the Northern host and save the heartland of the Confederacy from capture and ruin?

The book covers have titles and illustrations the relate to specific themes. Each letter of the alphabet appears twice within the deck and five of those letters (J,Q,X,Y,Z) are yellow, indicating a higher value for those letters.

Each game of Best Sellers consists of ten rounds. During each round, one player is designated as EDITOR. The editor shuffles the deck and presents them to the player on his left. The player draws three cards, flipping over two of them to reveal the letters on the backs. The book title on the third card is the theme to be used for the round.

Once the book title and the two letters have been chosen, the editor starts the two minute timer and all players, including the editor, begin writing a story inspired by the title/theme of the book cover. Players earn points by including as many words as possible which begin with either of the two letters chosen for the round. Each word that begins with one of these letters is worth one point.

- Words only count the first time they are used.
- Words must be in complete sentences to count.
- Words beginning with yellow letters are worth 2 points.

When the two minutes are up, each player stops writing. Beginning with the player immediately to the editor's left, each participant reads his/her story and announces the number of points earned. The editor adds the totals to the score sheet for the round and awards the book card to the player with the most points. At the end of ten rounds, players total their scores from each round, add 3 points for every book card held to reach a grand total. The player with the most points at the end of ten rounds is the winner of the game.

From the Publisher Rule Book:

Welcome to the world of the Shaman King TCGTM! In this game, players use their favorite shamans to fight one-on-one duels in order to crown a Shaman King. Its fast-paced and furious fun!

The Shaman King TCG is kind of like the traditional card game War. Like War, Shaman King TCG players dont have a hand of cards. Instead, players take turns flipping cards from the top of their decks and comparing their attacks. The Shaman King TCG is also different than War. When you play War, you only have one chance to match or defeat your opponents attack. In the Shaman King TCG, you have three chances, represented by the three colored zones. In War, cards are free to play, but in the Shaman King TCG, cards cost furyoku to play. Watch your furyoku carefully, and youll be successful.

The Shaman King TCG is easy to learn. Players take turns attacking their opponents with strike cards while defending against their opponents attacks at the same time. If your opponent fails to stop your strike in each of his or her three zones, you score a point. The first person to score three points wins the game.

Strikes arent the only thing you need to win a shaman duel. Sneaky tactics, represented by advantage cards, and help from ones friends, represented by teamwork cards, will mean the difference between winning and losing the game.

Each shaman also has a different set of signature moves that you can find on the special pull-out card inside the Shaman Chamber CardTM. These represent each shamans powerful attacks and may only be played under certain conditions.

16796,Spinnaker,1985,6.2,5,0,2,6,0,0,,Dice Sports ,Dice RollingSimulation,"Spinnaker is a yacht racing game where the most fiendishly cunning skipper wins. It is advisable that at least one skipper knows the rudiments of sailing and yachting terms.

Although dice are used, there is a strong element of judgment in choosing the best course, when to change direction and when to risk hoisting your spinnaker - because the wind may change and catch you out.

Raising is carried out on a nautical chart - there is one supplied and other charts could be used - in conjunction with the acetate overlay grid supplied. Players design a course by using the marker pen to designate a start line and a number of buoys which define the course to be sailed.

The game seeks to emulate the tactics of a real yacht or dinghy race, with a pre-start period of jostling for position followed by the start gun. The wind direction is recorded on a compass rose marked on the acetate and is variable, by reference to a D12. Different tacks (eg running, beating) allow different distances to be traveled in a turn, again mirroring the tactics of a real race.

Players take it in turn to play and real yacht-racing rules must be observed. Penalties for infringements must be observed too.

Advanced rules are also provided for regattas and handicaps.

There are 84 colourstrokes, which are small rectangles of card, each showing a daub of a particular colour.  Each player receives seven coloustrokes at random and the object of the game is to collect or swap colourstrokes in order to obtain the set of seven colourstrokes which are the principal colours apparent in that player's art card. This is harder than it might seem - there are, for example, quite a few very similar shades of white. 
 This game is principally designed to test a player's ability to match colours, but there is some luck introduced in the use of a spinner which can alternatively enable a player to win or lose colourstrokes.

On each player's turn he rolls all 4 dice and then using the combinations that appear covers some of his squares on his board. For example if a player rolls R Q 2  3 he can cover one of the following 4 alternatives: R3  Q2; or Q3  R2; or Q5 (adding together the 2 numbers); or R5.

Whenever a player is the first to complete a column, row or diagonal he is entitled to receive from all the other players the value of points that relate to it: 500 points for a horizontal row; 750 points for a vertical column; or 1000 points for either of the diagonals.

The game ends either when all combinations on the board are completed, or all but one player has run out of points tokens.

The winner of the game is the player with the most point tokens.

The game is further spiced up by the gaining of Qumero cards gained for rolling doubles, and Double-Double cards gained when rolling double-double (i.e. 2 identical numbers and 2 identical letters  rolled in the same turn).

Qumero cards can be used as wild cards to cover a number or letter even though it is not thrown. Double-double cards are used to either double, triple or quadruple (depending on how many cards he holds) his score for any completed column.

16799,Action Attraction,1995,5.16667,6,1,1,8,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Action / Dexterity ,,"Action Attraction is a game played with 42 magnetic marbles on a circular, 11 diameter, playing board with 31 indentations in it.

The idea of the game is very simple, each player in turn places a marble onto one of the indentations on the playing board. The first player to get rid of all his marbles is the winner.

The catch is, that because the marbles are unevenly magnetic, if you are not careful when you put a marble on the board, sometimes you will cause some (or even many) of the marbles to become attracted to each other. Any marbles that suffer this fate have to removed by the player causing the attraction, and added to his pool of marbles.

The game comes with suggestions for various alternative versions of the game.

Action Attraction can be played solo.

The game has two different skill levels which are switched between by movement of a lever on the underside of the board.

16800,Gawp,1996,4.27143,7,1.2,1,8,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Card Game ,Pattern Recognition,"Gawp is a card game for ages 7 and upwards.

The game is played using a set of 86 playing cards.

15 of the cards are laid out on the table (face up) in a 5 by 3 grid. Players look at the grid and try and spot pairs.

Each card consists of a pattern of rectangles of different sizes laid on top of each other giving the effect of an outer, middle and inner rectangle. Each rectangle can be one of three colors red, blue or yellow.

In a pair ALL the rectangles on one card must beat the equivalent rectangles on its pair. There is a combat rule to show what beats what: RED beats YELLOW; YELLOW beats BLUE: and BLUE beats RED. This sounds confusing but there is a combat help card as a reference, very soon this will not be required.

Whenever someone spots a pair he shouts Gawp and takes the pair from the grid. These are then replaced by 2 more cards, from the pack, by the dealer.

The game is over once all the cards are laid in the grid, and all the pairs are found. The player with the most cards is the winner.

There are rules for several variations of the basic game: Sudden Death Gawp; Gawp Solitaire 1  2, and Advanced Gawp.

However, the Circasians were not weak. Decades of brutal anti-raider warfare forced the Circasian Star Forces to learn and adapt to the hostile universe which surrounded them.

The lessons learned in the Raider Wars would be put to the test when, after years of thinly veiled hostility over the negotiating table, the actions of the Chouka Theocracy finally forced the Circasian Empire to make a fateful decision. By order of the War Council, a fleet was dispatched to begin a pre-emptive invasion of Chouka space. The Chouka War had begun.

The Escalation Wars: Empire Rising details both the history of the Chouka War and the powers involved in the conflict.

An all-family game by Tomy.  Fire steel balls down the track to keep the tank from turning its terrible nose on you.  If you hit, the terrible tank turns on your opponent.  If you miss, it keeps coming and blasts your anti-tank gun into the air.  The exciting, two-player game of skill, strategy, and timing.

Setup:
1. Install 2 AA batteries in the Terrible Tank.
2. Remove the steel ball bearings from center bridge supports storage compartment.
3. Assemble the two piece plastic bridge with the center support and an anti-tank gun emplacement at each end.
4. Lock the gun emplacement's explosion spring loaded arms.
5. Place the molded fake guns over the arms.
6. Load each gun emplacement with 6 balls.
7. Place the Terrible Tank on the center of the bridge with the turret facing perpendicular to the bridge.
8. Unleash hell (eg: turn on the tank).

Play:
After powered on, the Terrible Tank will start heading down one side of the bridge or the other.  Instead of a main gun, the Terrible Tank features a spinning pointed auger ... hence the Terribleness of the aforementioned Tank.

The player being advanced upon must use the plunger on his gun emplacement to fire steel balls at a target switch under the Terrible Tank.  When hit, the target switch will cause the Terrible Tank's turret to turn 180 degrees and reverse the motor to advance upon the opponent.

The target moves in and out of the Terrible Tank so a successful shot must be timed to hit the target when it is exposed.  A robotic driver also moves in and out of the top of Terrible Tank's turret.  Since the driver and target are synchronized, a successful shot will reach the Terrible Tank as the driver and target are fully exposed.

If the Terrible Tank advances all the way to a gun emplacement, it triggers a spring loaded explosion and your opponent gains a point.

Two counters on the center bridge support show the progress of the game.  The first person to reach six points win.

The surviving members of the government have asked for American intervention. Your MEU (Marine Expeditionary Unit) is in the area, but there are no other forces available, and speed is of the essence, so the Marines have the ball. Your task is to fight your way into Unnarstan, occupy the capital, and bring the rightful government back there before you run out of supplies, which will happen in 15 days. You have advantages in numbers and quality, and you get to choose where your invasion will go in, but time and terrain are against you. Semper fi!

Player 2: Liberation! At last, our fair nation is free of foreign influences! Generalissimo, you have done well, but the imperialists are sure to react to our coup. Our armed forces are equipped with American weapons, so if they try to intervene, you can give them a taste of their own medicine. You must fight wisely, for we are outnumbered, but we know our own land and can defend it well. All we require is that you delay the invaders until their supplies run out, and then annihilate them at leisure. Death to the invaders!

The nation of Hyrax has been invaded and overrun by forces from the neighboring nation of Koni. The United Nations has condemned the invasion and authorized the use of force, and your 82nd-Airborne ready battalion will be that force. You must make an immediate drop before the invaders can dig in, and reinforce yourself as needed later. Your goals are to free the capital of Hyrax and at least one other city from the invaders, and to capture at least one airfield so other UN forces can land there and finish what you've started. Those forces will start arriving in three days, which is also the amount of time your men can fight without resupply. Take 'em down! Airborne all the way!

Player 2: A dog's curse be on the United Nations and their resolutions! This territory belonged to our ancestors before the colonial imperialists divided it up, and it is ours again, and we will never leave it. The initial attacks were successful beyond our wildest dreams, and the whole country fell like dominoes. Now we must prepare for the counterattack that the UN and their lackeys will certainly launch. Most of our navy is at sea, searching for enemy ships that might bring invaders, and all the land approaches to our nation are well-guarded. But an attack could come from anywhere at any time, so you must be vigilant. Long live Koni!

The answer wasn't long in coming. A huge boulder sailed across the valley and smashed into the ground just short of Hector's forces. One of his men went down screaming, hit by a sliver of rock. So Jason had a cyclops in his army, did he? Hector looked over to his minotaurs, roaring and waving their battleaxes. They would make short work of a cyclops, and then his ogres would begin the slaughter. He gave the hand signals for his line of mighty beasts to advance. This would be a day to remember!

If he had noticed the shadow that flitted over him, he might have looked up and seen Jason's roc beginning its dive on his forces...

From the rules intro:

There was a time on this great planet of ours that wars were fought between nations and/or political factions for ideals, territory, money, or power.  Although the goals remain the same, wars are no longer fought by people in uniform.  Today's wars are fought by the groups that hold the real power in today's society.  Political factions are puppets to these entities, armies and military might are under their control.  These entities are referred to by a name that belies the fact that they have more power than any nation on the planet:  the Corporation.  The foot soldiers who slog forward daily to do battle on myriad fronts are no longer called privates, cadets or seamen.  Today's foot soldier defends his particular trench under the idealized rank of account representative, data input specialist, or simply, marketing representative.  His/her trench is also outfitted with the modern conveniences of a fax machine, a speed-dial telephone, and part interest in a secretary.

The object of the game is to have 3 balls of your own colour stacked one on top of the other in a groove.

Two players each have 6 balls in their own colour. Each in turn places one ball in one of the six grooves. You can stack on top of your opponent's as well as your own balls. But no more than 3 balls are allowed in any one groove at this point. When all 12 balls have been placed, the players take it turns to move one ball from one groove to another: now there can be up to four balls in a groove.

You can only move one ball in your own colour and only if it is lying alone in a groove or uppermost in the groove, i.e. nearest the centre of the board. It is NOT counted as a move, however, if by moving a ball to another groove it happens that the balls in this groove are of the same number and in the same colour sequence as in the old groove before the ball left it.

A player has lost the game if he or she has no possibility of moving.

Humans have begun to establish a new history of wanton destruction and unbridled creativity. The Singularity rift that eventually will lead to the establishment of a utopia is centuries away in the future. The fledgling nation of U.S.N.A. originally set up by the North Americans of old earth is fast becoming one of the most powerful of the industrial states.

As nations formed and the population began to be settled the media was there to cover it. Whenever a settler put a spade in the ground, wiped out a species or did something horrible to another human being a camera was there. The media became the chronicler of the pioneering years, and more. To forget the hardships of day-to-day living the Neo-earthlings immersed themselves in all forms of entertainment sims, V.R. and finally real combat TV. Beginning as fighting matches between professional athletes it quickly evolved to include audience participation. Teams of home viewers roamed across elaborate battlegrounds beating the snot out of each other for the sake of entertainment. These teams eventually became fighting orders with their own particular combat styles. As long as TV audiences could see a New Texan housewife savagely mauling an accountant from Maine with a pain-wand each week real combat TV continued to be a success.

Nobody knows exactly when FENRIR (Fusion Engine Non-Robotic Intercept Raider) was invented. Originally developed as support for conventional army forces, they began to be used in the frontier areas and in civilian control situations. The executives of the NABC (Neo-American Broadcasting Corporation) weren't slow to adopt this new technology and use FENRIR in their real combat events. Unable to construct artificial battlegrounds of a sufficient size the media networks purchased the ruins of Harmony, the former capital of the USNA state of Piermont that had been destroyed during the conflict with the Ontarians. In this city-sized arena the combatants now range across the landscape in giant FENRIR machines dealing devastation to the opposing team(s). The ultimate televised combat sport is born!

In PIKE: City arena each person controls one of the four major real combat teams. The object is to crush the opposition while putting on the most entertaining show for the cameras.

It uses a curious dice-rolling mechanism that allows players to try to place their fly balls, ground balls, and bunts on a spot of the field least covered by opposing fielders. Strategy comes into play on offense in strategically allocating dice for a fly ball; on defense with positioning fielders to optimally cover the field.

No production date is given, but one of the Sid Sackson collection copies of this game was marked as being acquired in 1983.

From the rules:

COLOPTION is a fast paced adult game with some gaming elements familiar to generations of games players and new devices [...]. The object of the game, which is played on a geometrically designed game board, is to move your men from their home base to a goal. To do this, you must roll combinations of dice and color cubes and move your men through an exit triangle, hazard hexagon, safety zones, alien colors and goal paths. If that's not enough, there's also the danger of being 'bumped' by other players!

COLOPTION can be played by two to six players which immediately makes it more sociable than backgammon which is played as a twosome. A round is over when all of one player's men have either reached the goal or been bumped. A round usually lasts from fifteen to thirty minutes. Play can be for several rounds as in backgammon or for point totals as in bridge.

It is an unusual title in terms of historical insight, having been published in 1986 and embellishing its instructions with Albert Einstein's quote, imagination is more important than knowledge. The game treats a subject that few would take seriously at the time -- though, in hindsight, its designers also failed in imagination for the weights given the various terror targets.

At least three different editions of Longball were released. The first edition was in 1975 by Ashburn Industries and offered cards based on the 1974 season and projected 1975 rookies.

The 1979 edition of Longball offers two levels of game play: the Master Game, an Advanced Master Game, and the Basic Game.

16924,Helios,1938,8,1,0,2,2,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Mythology ,,"Helios (subtitled The Game of the Gods) is a chess-like game loosely inspired by classical mythology.

The king for each side is Helios, the sun god, and nine other pieces on each side represent the planets and the gods they are named after.  Three other pieces on each side represent Earth's Moon and its orbital nodes.  The pieces are made of a plastic called Tenite (according to the rulebook) and resemble chess pieces topped with the traditional planetary symbols.

The pieces have movement powers reminiscent of those of chess pieces, but with some differences: several pieces have more than one way to move, one mode of movement - N squares at a time in any direction, repeated 3 times - is not found in standard chess, and generally speaking pieces are limited to moving a number of spaces equal to their relative position from the Sun plus 1 (e.g., the Earth piece can move 4 squares at a time).

The board is a 20x20 grid with a block of 40 unplayable spaces in the center.  There are special starred spaces on the board which are used by the pieces with weaker standard movement (Mercury and Helios) to teleport around the board.

Pieces are captured by landing on them.  The object is to put the opponent's Helios in checkmate (or total eclipse).

In addition to the rules themselves, the rulebook includes information on the gods and planets represented by the pieces.

16926,Super Plug,1999,3.2,5,2,2,6,15,15,,Card Game Humor ,Hand Management,"You don't know the power of the plug!

Cards and rules in an envelope, following the Cheapass design philosophy.  The premise is that the players are trying to get the landlord's attention by plugging up the toilet in their apartment with anything they can find on the theory that, while the toilet is being fixed all the other things wrong with the apartment will be fixed also.  Having lived in off-campus apartments during college, I can relate.

Each player is given a playing mat with a picture of a toilet on it and is dealt one card.  On each player's turn they may draw from 0-2 cards and play one card, either on their own toilet or another player's.  The winner is the first person to exactly reach a predetermined level of points worth of stuff in their toilet (20 points for a two player game, 18 for three, etc.)  Some cards are worth negative points and are played on opponents.  That person must then remove that many points worth of stuff from their toilet.  If they don't have any cards small enough (say a -2 card was played, for instance) they must discard a larger card (Baby Brother [+5] for instance) and accept the greater loss--no making change allowed.  There are also Pet cards.  While a player has a Pet card next to their toilet they cannot win even if their toilet is full to the required score--the landlord doesn't allow pets.  They may discard the Pet card, but this counts as their entire action for the turn and they may not draw or play any other cards.

Each copy of Super Plug also comes with 5 blank cards.  Players are encouraged to create cards of their own.

The game came with four Matchbox cars; these are now very rare collectibles.

(subtitled The Ultimate Starcruiser?) was one of Grenadier's Midi Games (sic) or The Great Little Games Line, depending on whether you believe the box or the rules.  This was a small line of games somewhat larger than a typical mini-game of the day.

Hydra! could reasonably be described as Ogre in Space. As in Ogre one player has a single huge unit while the other has many small units. Here the large unit is the eponymous Hydra, which has phasers, proton torpedoes, energy sapper discs, a gyro-de-stabilizer, a molecular structure distorter, and a force field projector.  The other player gets frigates, battle cruisers, larger battle cruisers, and mine sweepers. Damage for both sides is marked off on record sheets.

The Hydra player's goal is simply to destroy as many enemy ships as possible, but players are invited to make up other scenarios and some extra counters are provided to facilitate this.

7001 in the Great Little Games Line. The back of the first (only?) printing's box came with the sheet for the game Journey and listed its part number also as #7001. This same sheet also came with the actual game Journey as well. However, the sides of the boxes had Hydra! as 7001 and Journey as 7002.

16932,Starcross,1982,0,0,0,2,6,60,60,Wargames,Science Fiction Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterModular Board,"Starcross is a relatively simple strategic science fiction game.

The board is made up of a number of hexagonal sections, the number in use depending on the number of players and the desired length of the game.  Each section has a number of star systems which produce varying amounts of credit, and have no other characteristics.  Players use their controlled credit each turn to build or upgrade their ships.
Ships have two characteristics, movement speed and combat strength - players choose the values of these by how much they spend.

Interest is added by the technological advances which can be purchased.  Some of these are permanent, such as Hyperdrive, which lets one ship per turn move an unlimited distance, or Capture, which lets you capture enemy ships if you have a 3:1 advantage, while some are temporary, such as Force Field, which protects a system for one turn.  (Capture will sound familiar to players of Flying Buffalo's Starweb play-by-mail game - most of the Starweb abilities are in fact reproduced here.)  Each advance can only be purchased a given number of times per game (depending on the number of players), so players will be forced to use different mixes of abilities.

The object of the game is to control a given quantity of credit production.

Select and shuffle up to FOUR Battle Discs at a time. Place them into the plastic ball and shake it. Open it and slam down the ball-half containing the discs. The other players do the same. Once all the players have their pile of discs in front of them the battle begins.

Each player places the discs in a straight line in the order that they have come out of the plastic ball. Place the matching figure next to the disc.

Starting with the first disc, each player flips their disc into the air. How it lands determines who wins the battle and puts the other player's figures out of the competition. The disc with the greatest power rating (number of stars) wins. A tie of the highest numbers has to be flipped again until there is a winner.

Play continues until all the figures are defeated except for the remaining one who is the champion.

On their turn, players decide if they want to engage in a face-off competition using their top card, or instead place that card into the Kids Next Door's tree house headquarters. Cards placed in the tree house help boost the power of cards that are played in future face-offs.

When cards are played in a face-off, the player with the higher number (which may get boosted by a card banked in the tree house) wins the round. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game, ensuring an entire game can be played in five minutes or less.

And what happens when each player plays a same-colored card? Both players race to be the first to slap a giant panic button placed on the playing mat to determine the round's winner.

A slide comes out the bottom and ends flush with the playing surface where a plastic cowboy is attached. When you pull the trigger, a ball rolls down the slide, goes through the legs of the cowboy and shoots across the tray toward your opponent's side. Each plastic cowboy has a tab by its feet that acts as a target. Hit it with a bullet and the cowboy gets knock down dead. The fist player to shoot the other player's cowboy wins.

This game simulates the Japanese most popular space opera novel The Galactic Heroes Legend, Ginga Eiyu Densetsu.

In the distant future, Human conflicts between two major powers have divided the Galactic World  into Reich and Free Planets.

Reich is under the rule of a dangerous emperor and corrupted aristocrats, while the people of the Free Planets have lost the ideals of their foundation and are under corrupted populism also.

So both camps have no ability to break the enemy or to settle the war which has dragged on for many hundreds of years.

But, the times have produced two geniuses of war into the same period.
One is Reinhelt von Roengram, the incomparable artist of a war in the Galaxy.

The other is Yan Wenlee, called Yan the Miracle, the magician of a war.

Their appearance will change the era that they live in.

In this game, players command Reich or Free Planets.

This game contains three types of space combat ship units (BB,CL,CV) and various units which appeared in the original story.

The game uses a complete original system.

This game combines three types of starships, Battle Ship, Galaxy Cruiser, and Galaxy Fighter.

Players organize Fleets under the command of unique admirals by combining characteristics of  Starships.

Each counter in the game is an Admiral in the anime and is rated by his fighting skills.

You use resource points to create or buy ships and put them under your admirals sort of like Hitler's war.

This game came out in Old Games Journal #40.

17000,The Highest Ground,1997,0,0,0,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Ancient Modern Warfare Science Fiction Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"The Highest ground is a game that imagines a world that has a very long period variable climate. Where an alien species has, approximately every 800 Earth years, collected a band of warriors from the most advanced warrior state on Earth at the time, and transported them to this planet. There they are to achieve dominance over the local population, grow a crop for the aliens and, in the ensuing climactic holocaust, be almost wiped out and, therefore, not become a threat to the aliens.

At the time depicted by the game the [aliens] have just bagged a new group of Earthlings and taken them to the planet. This group is from 1979 and is a bunch of mercenaries on the losing side of an African civil war. They have been grabbed from a soon to be terminally untenable position. They have been taken to a planet where the society that has grown up around the survivors of previous recruiting drives consists of several warring states peopled by Medieval feudal kingdoms and knights, Roman legions, pony riding barbarians and Egyptian pharaohs. The game finds the few mercenaries, having allied themselves with the European kingdoms, at war with the local Roman empire.

17001,Battle Command,1988,4.33333,3,0,2,4,30,30,,Modern Warfare ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Generic land battle strategy board game.  Box measures 20 x 11 1/4.  Single-fold mounted color game board with 21 x 19 one-inch-square grid superimposed to regulate movement.  Terrain represented includes Mountain, Forest, Plains, Fords, and Rivers.  Multi-square Airfields also represented.

Miniature plastic pieces include Tanks, APCs and Airplanes (six Tanks, six APCs and three Airplanes per side; complete set of each in Yellow, Brown, Green, and Blue).  The APCs are eight-wheeled turreted vehicles strongly resembling a USMC LAV.  Tanks resemble a cross between the US Army M-109 SP gun and an Israeli Merkava tank.  Airplanes slightly resemble early speculative depictions of a Stealth fighter with twin tails and an unflattering forward-swept projection on the leading wing edge.
  
All of these units are moved according to the roll of two six-sided dice.  Die results are added together; the sum (dice units) is allocated among friendly pieces for movement.

Terrain costs vary for Tank and APC units.  Pieces may be moved in any direction including diagonally, but may not stack together or pass through an occupied space.

All unit types have a range of two spaces.  Tanks may not attack Airplanes (unless all friendly Airplanes are destroyed).  Airplanes must be airborne in order to attack (they must take off down the runway of their airstrip).

Combat is resolved by die roll, attacker and targeted defender each rolling one die.  The result of subtracting low roll from high roll is referenced to a Battle Chart yielding a result of Safe, Disabled or Destroyed.  APCs are destroyed on a difference of 1 or more.  Tanks are disabled by a difference of 1 or 2 and destroyed by a differential of 3 or more.  Airplanes are destroyed by a differential of 3 or more vs. another Airplane or an APC or a 4 or 5 if beaten by a tank. Airplanes are disabled by a 1 or 2 differential vs. another Airplane or an APC.

Destroyed units are removed.  Disabled tanks are turned on their side.  Disabled tanks may be captured.  A friendly or enemy APC may capture a disabled tank by moving adjacent and surviving until the next friendly turn.  At the start of the next friendly turn, the tank is turned rightside-up and is considered friendly to the capturing player.

Disabled Airplanes crash land.  The disabled Airplane travels three spaces in a straight line (in any direction the owning player chooses) and is turned upside-down.  During this descent the Airplane may pass over other units, but the space it crashes in must be vacant.  An APC (friendly or hostile) may recover the downed Airplane in the same manner as a Tank is recovered; however, when the Airplane is turned rightside-up, it is immediately returned to a friendly Airbase parking space.

Disabled pieces may be attacked and destroyed instead of being captured if a player so chooses.

A unit may only inflict damage on the first unit to attack it in a given turn.  If a piece survives an initial attack and is attacked again, it rolls in defense as usual, but will not inflict any damage on its attacker even if its die roll is higher.

Airbases may be captured by disabling or destroying all hostile pieces on the Airbase and then occupying at least one square of the Airbase with a friendly Tank or APC.

The object of the game is to be the last player with a surviving APC unit.

Rules include options for a short game with less equipment.  A small paper insert, dated 1991, provided a simpler version using the same movement rules but capturing by simply moving a piece onto an opposing piece space, moving and capturing until all dice units have been used.

The box art painting accurately portrays the pieces inside.  One of the modernistic tanks advances firing, evading a near miss while the moon lights APCs crossing a stream to the rear in Ardennes-type terrain as jets swoop above.  The title Battle Command appears in large red letters all the way across the top of this illustration.  In smaller white letters across the bottom: A Fast-Playing Game of Strategy, Daring, and Chance!

In the lower right corner is the logo of Precision Toy, white letters superimposed over a line of evergreens with the title and evergreens reflected oppositely beneath.  The back cover features a large black-and-white photo of the board and components.  Precision Toy was located in Julian, CA 92036.  The game was made in USA.

A deck of cards is shuffled and the first card is drawn and placed on the appropriate spot on the playing board.  Each player then spins the dial once, and EACH player must move their playing piece with the intention of reaching the spot with the trouble card (the spaces on the spinner have a number 0,1,2, or 3, related to each players color so during each spin, each player moves their playing piece the number of spaces indicated for the color of their playing piece).  Pieces can move forward or backwards and any number of players can occupy the same space.  Once a player lands on the card that represents the trouble spot, the card is taken by that player and a new card is drawn and the process repeats.

17015,The Original Intersection,1981,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,,Dice ,Roll / Spin and Move,"The Original Intersection TM is the humorously intended title of a game that owes almost all of its creative inspiration to Parcheesi, the Westernized version itself of Pachisi.  The designers are simply experimenting to see how little they have to change to come up with their own game that will make them a million dollars in royalties, (or at least a tidy income so they can design MORE games without otherwise having to work) and thus, avoiding copyright infringement lawsuits.  As such, it IS a useful and instructive game, as it is almost certain that they would have made more money had they simply reproduced the original public domain version and sold it.

The game differs from Parcheesi in that it has a jazzier layout, where the players move in a more complicated journey around a mazelike path of concentric circles.  An additional option is the ability to play as a partner with other players, moving your partner's  pieces once yours are all safely home.

Though the board itself IS reasonably attractive, this is purely a novelty game, purchased for no other reason than that probably nobody else had ever seen it.  It is one step away from a total home production, in that the parts are made nearly as cheaply as possible.  Indeed, though it looks totally unplayed, the box is so flimsily designed, that it is bent in several places.  The tokens are push pins with the pins removed to save production costs.

The game includes a hunny pot with a spring operated spinning ball shaped indicator to determine whether you get the hunny and can play the turn, or whether the bees appear and you have to pass the turn.  There are circle discs (called Tokens) with Pooh's friends (Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit, and Roo) on one side, and a Hunny Pot on the other side.  There is also one Pooh Token.

Hunny Pot Picnic has two difficulty levels of play:

Level One: Is a simple collection game to collect the most Tokens.  If the Hunny Pot doesn't show bees when it is activated, you collect a Token. The player with the most Hunny Tokens wins.

Level Two: Requires some memory skills.  You collect Tokens with the Hunny Pot indicator, but the object is to get each one of Pooh's friends.  If you flip over a Token of a Pooh friend you have already collected, you turn it back over, so that other players can remember where it was and collect it.

Comes in a box with 11 miniatures, one 128-page book (the rules are about 14 pages - the rest is lists and background), two dice and a tape measure.

The heart of the game is an action point system with straight d10 rolls used to resolve actions.  Combat is a lengthy process where you have to hit, wound and beat an armor save (yes, it's Warhammer 40k all over again) and then see what injury you delivered. Armor and injury saves are not modified by weapons, so whether you took a hit from a derringer or an anti-material rifle makes no difference to the target - a rather silly outcome, but there you have it.

There is a point buy system, a lengthy compendium of weapons  equipment (many of them with quite unrealistic stats) and a number of light vehicles (civilian models primarily - no tanks or APCs).

A magical game of chance

Who will be the lucky guesser and the first to manage to place all their tiles? A cheerful murmur rings through the magic caves: Each year the apprentices meet to compare their clairvoyant abilities. But only the best can win the magic contest.

Each child has their own magic equipment, which they place on the four different magic objects and five tiles. Each round two children play a game with one another. One child secretly divides his magic objects between his two hands. The other chooses one of the hands and looks at what it holds: Are there magic objects whose tiles they hold? If so, they can put them aside.

Instead of expensive figures, you use free downloadable counters. Instead of a large gaming table filled with hand-made scenery, you use my M8 maps. If you want a bigger army or a larger map, just download another page and print it. Time-consuming movement and combat rules have been replaced with fast-playing hex-based rules. And all the occult stuff in the original game has been replaced with... nothing at all.

If you're unfamiliar with that game, the premise is straightforward: buy soldiers, vehicles and weapons with the build-points given to you, then fight an enemy of a different alien race. You can also buy experience or special skills for your troops, or add a Hero if you think he will help. Some races excel at crunching close combat, while some prefer a fast-moving style; some fight in low-tech swarms, and others prefer high-tech gadgets. Vehicles range from one-man scout bikes to hulking super-tanks. The size of the battle can be a squad of foot soldiers, or a company of 150-plus men with dozens of vehicles, or anything in between. Several basic scenarios are provided with the rules. Almost everything is definable. 


StarMarines is a Free game based off of War Hammer 40,000

Sugar  Vice introduces two new breeds of Wee Folk: the decadent Moon-Fairies and the vulgar Pixies!

Lunar descendants of the old Fae royalty, the Moon-Fairies share a common ancestry with the Glitters of Earth.  Unlike their earthly cousins, they've progressed (or perhaps degenerated) into a glamorous Rock  Roll-loving fairy kingdom.  All goes well until they decide to check up on the Earth they left behind so long ago, only to find their former subjects have become murderous, barbaric, and frighteningly powerful.

To cope with the power Fairy Meat gives the insubordinate natives, the meat-intolerant Moons have developed a magical lip gloss known as Pink.  Pink allows them to kiss dead fairies rather than eat them, vampirically soaking up the corpse's powerful fairy essences.  This addictive cosmetic gives them a much-needed edge on the battlefield, but it carries a terrible price; with the deadly risk of Overkiss, every kiss might be your last...

Sugar and Vice includes:
Rules and background for musical Moon-Fairy bands, Pixie mercenaries  gangs, and reality-warping Glamour Chunks!
More weapons, Twinkle spells, wands , and (yes) magic items!
Tasty new full-color counters!

Sugar  Vice provides more equipment, troops, spells and game options to all Fairy Meat players, expanding the game while keeping gameplay as swift and bloody as you've come to expect.

Do the Visa Run, find your accommodation, and then hit the bar but keep an eye on your bag! Discover the must-do traveling experiences and the pitfalls to avoid, see the sights and survive the rickety public transport - all whilst racing across six continents with your mates. The first to travel the world in one piece wins the game

Just like the real thing, you have to travel on a tight budget - but dont worry, there are plenty of opportunities to work and even phone home to bag some extra cash from Mum and Dad! You'll realize how quickly your money runs out, learn about the scams, the transport, the toilets... It's as close as you can get to the real thing without the food poisoning.

Designed by Marcus Lane, an experienced traveler, the game offers a backpacking insight that is difficult to grasp from books alone. Marcus says, When I was knocking back a home-made rocket fuel in a remote Asian village one day I realized what a fascinating yet surreal world I was traveling in. I had read books that touched on some of the real issues of backpacking but nothing came close to telling me the full story. I decided to find another way to teach people what they were in for. It's as close to a trial run as there can be. You'll see how challenging yet fun the experience can be as you travel around the world meeting lots of new people and consuming all sorts of strange foods.

Can you make it as a BACKPACKER? is quite simply the fun way to learn how to plan a safe trip.

Great for gap year students, career break gappers or anyone who fancies a trip down memory lane. Contains a gameboard, 6 backpackers, 224 Visa Run cards, 156 Continent cards, a Foreign Embassy, a wedge of doofers (cash), a dice and rules.

Barbarossa (translated to Redbeard) was the nickname of Emperor Friedrich I, who lived from 1123 to 1190. He was crowned as king in 1152, and Emperor in Rome in 1155.

Before the game starts, the players agree on a playing time. Whoever is the richest (cash plus value of knights, squires and archers) by that time wins the game. In addition you can win by being the only player with a live king, or by having a certain numbers of cities and castles (2 players = 16, 3 players = 14, 4 players = 12).

There are rules for movement, which depends on the unit, and the terrain moving through. Combat, which depends on the units, and the defenders position. Tax collection, including the ability to bleed the peasants, and their possible revolt. Pillaging of cloisters, buying now units, and drawing a chance card at the end of each year.

MOTOYAMA AIRFIELD #2, Iwo Jima, 27 February 1945: The Marines of Colonel Kenyons 9th Marine Regiment had a rough time during their first day in the line, 26 February. They had made two determined assaults on Hill Peter, to no avail. After reorganizing during the night, the 9th Marines were ready for another push to the top of the hill. At 1250 hrs., their break came. Following a ten minute preparation by division and corps artillery, both battalions struck out in a coordinated attack. With the 1st Battalion on the right and the 2nd on the left, the Marines began their move up the slopes of Hill Peter. The 1st Battalion overran the hill and continued on down the reverse slope and up to the crest of Hill Oboe to the northwest. The 1st Battalions A Company did not enjoy the same momentum on their way to Oboe. A Company was stopped by a small enemy AA detachment with supporting fire from emplaced machine-guns in a small draw on their right flank. A Company rapidly deployed to meet this threat.

ATS SEMPER FI! (aka Uncommon Valor Upgrade Edition) is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Iwo Jima. Three years into the Pacific war the United States Marine Corps had mastered the art of the amphibious landing. The landing force at Iwo still had much to learn about the enemy. Senior intelligence officers did not know until 27 February that General Kuribayashi was in fact personally running the show from his headquarters on Iwo Jima. As the Marines regrouped after their landing, it was obvious that something was different on Iwo Jima. No dense jungles, just ash from the islands volcano, Suribachi. Steam could be seen rising from the natural sulfur water wells which bubbled to the surface all over the island. Worse, the dug-in defenders actually numbered half again the original estimate of 13,000. Kuribayshi was particularly pleased with the quality of his artillery and engineering troops. The Japanese defenders waiting for the advance of the V Amphibious Corps were well armed and confident. The game depicts the confrontation at Motoyama Airfield #2, a war waged with the most vicious weapons available to the combatants, including flame-throwing Zippo Shermans and Japanese heavy artillery. Everything is included to play!.

ITEM POCKET, OKINAWA, 20 April 1944: As the afternoon wore on with G Company unable to release the Japanese grip on the Pocket, Lieutenant Colonel McDonough decided to send up E Company. At 1350 hours the company commander, Captain George R. J. Weigand, was ordered to move up between the two ridges, then turn left, using Fox Ridge as cover. The goal of the onslaught was Ryans Ridge, or alternately the road cut west of Gusukuma. It was still assumed at that point that contact could be established with 1st Battalion. Weigand completed passing through Ryans left flank and attacked east toward the crest of Ryans Ridge, heading toward what the Company Commander thought would be a covered route to the top of the ridge. Weigand attacked in platoons, moving to the point with 3rd Platoon, under command of Technical Sergeant Ernest L. Shoeff. This platoon would find itself attacking alone, after a storm of enemy machine-gun and mortar fire forced the rest of the company to ground. Weigand, Shoeff, and two squads kept moving forward, using tombs at the foot of the hill for cover. Orders were communicated to Weigand by a runner: extend the line at all costs. The Captain and two men soon found themselves cut off from Shoeff and the remainder of the main body. For the rest of the afternoon the company commander was under constant fire and out of communications with everyone. After dark Weigand managed to make his way back to Fox Ridge and rejoin his company. His uniform was shot full of holes but Weigand returned uninjured.

ATS BLOOD  IRON is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Okinawa. The center of the Japanese resistance in the area lay in the I section of Target Area 7777, which came to be called Item Pocketin military terminology I is called Item. The pocket was the hub of the enemy position; from it, like spokes on a giant wheel, extended four low ridges, separated from each other by ravines and rice paddies. Potters Ridge ran north from the hub, Charlie Ridge to the northeast, Gusukuma Ridge to the southeast, and Ryan Ridge to the southwest. Lying between Gusukuma and Charlie Ridges and sloping to the east was a cone-shaped hill called by the Americans Brewers Hill. A gulch ran along each side of the hillAndersons Gulch on the north and Dead Horse Gulch on the south. Both ran in an easterly direction, crossing Route 1 at small bridges just north of Gusukuma. The ground was superbly suited for active defense. Typical Japanese positions were connected by tunnels along the sides and under the crests of the ridges; Ryan Ridge, in particular, was honeycombed with such defenses. From Item Pocket the enemy had excellent command both of the coastal areas to the north and west and the open land to the east where Route 1 ran north-south. The Japanese had long been aware of the defensive value of this position against either a beach landing on the northwest or an attack from the north. Months before the Americans landed, Japanese troops and Okinawan laborers were boring tunnels and establishing elaborate living quarters and aid stations. The area was held by two companies of the 21st Independent Infantry Battalion of the 64th Brigade, 62nd Division, supported by an antitank company, a machine gun company, and elements of antiaircraft, artillery, and mortar units. At least 600 Japanese occupied the Pocket, reinforced by several hundred Okinawans.

The game simply involves guessing the missing blank in a sentence.  The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank.  Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.
 One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a contestant and a panelist.  The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.

When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.

The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the Super Match Game. In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.

If that space has a flower, the player gets another turn.  If the player lands on a bumble bee, they have to go back to the spot of the previous bumble bee on the board.  There are short cuts (Rainbow Bridge, Butterfly Trail, Crystal Path) to speed you along your route.  The winner is the player to be the first to Barbie's Jeweled Palace.

17188,The Original Fortune Telling Board Game,1996,4,2,0,1,6,60,60,,,Roll / Spin and Move,"From the back of the box:

The Original Fortune Telling Board Game  by Jennifer Sands is the only board game of its kind that combines a fun and safe methodology based on modern fortune card readings and empowered by real mystical stones.  With a roll of the dice each player is whisked away on a journey to discover his or her special personalized fortune.  Collect, win, lose or buy LOVE, MONEY, PEOPLE and Question cards in this fun and exciting game where all players win a real personalized fortune card reading of their own.

---

Each player rolls the die, moves his or her pawn, and then does what the landed on square tells them to.  This is almost always either gaining or losing fortune telling cards (from four different decks - love, money, people, and questions) or empowering stones (which can be traded in for fortune telling cards).  The rules state that the object is for each player to collect as many fortune telling cards as possible; but they also state that the winner is the player who draws the last card, which ends the game and allows that player to discard up to three of their cards.

The real purpose is for each player to use the cards collected during the game to have their personal fortune told on the tarot-style card layout board.

If you believe in this stuff, you'll be happy to know that all Jennifer Sands products are created with the assistance of professional psychics, fortune tellers and astrologers.  All Jennifer Sands products use safe fortune telling methodologies.

If you don't believe in this stuff, you'll note this product is for entertainment purposes only.

The 1987 F. X. Schmid copyright implies it may have been publisehd by that company too. Other games in the TuttiGiochi series (listed in the rules leaflet) are 'Micio-Gatto', 'Gioco Dei Nomi', 'Roulette Scozzese', 'La Torre Di Babele' and 'Sole, Luna E Stelle'.

Doppia Coppia means 'two pairs' in Italian, and reflects the objective of the game - to form a square using two pairs of pieces in two different colours. This simple abstract game for two players consists of a 5-by-5 square board, 5 red pieces and 5 yellow pieces. Pieces of the same colour start in a row at opposite ends of the board and players take turns to move a piece of their colour one square at a time orthogonally. A piece may also jump over one other piece as a move. The central square on the board is occupied by a four-leaf clover and pieces may not enter this square nor jump over it. A player wins when he or she makes a move that completes a square (I interpret this to be a 2-by-2 square) containing 2 red and 2 yellow pieces (the two colours may be side-by-side or crossing diagonally).

Components:

Gameboard
250 Question Cards (2000 questions)
Dice
Counters
Rules

Players move round the board through a combination of dice throws and answering questions from the cards.

During his turn a player earns the right to move any of his or her four counters by correctly answering the first question (of 6) on a card - this question normally refers to a picture on the reverse of the card.

The distance moved is determined by dice roll - this roll also being used to determine the number of the next question to be answered (from the same card).  If the player answers the question correctly they may roll the dice again and have another question asked (from the same card).  Play continues in this manner until a question is answered incorrectly or the same number is rolled twice on that particular card.  It is then the next player's turn.

Movement is also influenced by certain of the cards and instructions written on the board.

There is also an element of tactical play in that landing one of your counters on the same square as another player's counter you send that counter back to that player's start point.

The winner is the first player to take all of their four counters around the world (the board) from their start to their finish point.

There are several types of square, which determine who may answer the question.  A solo square means only the person whose marker is on the square may answer.  A Free-For-All square means all players have the opportunity to answer.  A Proxy square means the active player chooses another player to answer for them; the active player advances on the correct answer, but the proxy goes back if they answer incorrectly.

As soon as someone answers correctly, they and the active player move ahead the number of squares matching the level of clue that was the question was answered on.

Each players turn finishes after one move.

There are also Providence cards, which usually result in either going forward or back a number of squares.

First to reach the finish square wins.

Firstly, it's against the clock, then it's against another player, then you have to answer some Can't Cook or Won't Cook questions, oh and did we mention you could be rolling the pastry, tossing the pancake, chopping the herbs, stirring the pans....

The objective is to move around the board in order to collect points. Points are collected as you collect ingredient tokens. The game ends when the first player has collected all 5 ingredients. Movement is determined by dice roll with each player taking turns to have one minute (a sand timer is provided) to move and accomplish as much as they can.

The spaces on the board dictate the activities to be undertaken on them. These include:
- collecting an ingredient, 
- pausing for a cup of tea (rolling until you get a 2),
- answering questions (cookery related - involving choosing your answer from a choice of four) or 
- performing an action - stir the pan, roll the pastry, chop the herbs or toss the pancake (the equipment for which is all included with the game)

Components:
5 Limbo Blocks (wooden blocks (5cm x 5cm x 13cm)
1 Limbo Bar (wooden block (0.5cm x 5cm x 13cm) with Velcro pad
1 Limbo-low-nose (with Velcro pad)

The five limbo blocks are stacked on top of each other on the floor with the limbo bar on the top.  Players take it in turns to wear the Limbo-low-nose and bend over an pick up the limbo bar with their nose.  This must be achieved with only the feet in contact with the floor.  Each player has three attempts - players who cannot do this, or touch the floor with any part of their body other than their feet are eliminated.

Once everyone has succeeded or been eliminated the bar is lowered by removing one of the limbo blocks so that the limbo bar is now resting on four blocks.  Players now attempt at this height.

Play continues in this way, gradually reducing the height of the bar until either only one player is left or until at least two players have successfully picked up the bar from the floor.  If this happens all five blocks are placed under the limbo bar again, and the exercise repeated, but this time players are only allowed to stand on one foot!

17294,Prehistoric Settlements,1998,7.14286,7,3,2,4,120,120,,Miniatures Prehistoric Wargame ,,"From the website:

Set about 50,000 years B.C. in an age of hunter gathers, and the last of the strange large mammals, such as Woolly Mammoths, Sabre-tooth Tigers and Giant Birds, the game is a mixture of board games and wargames and was a daunting task to create. It was easy all we had to do was make it simple and quick to play, whilst still blending in a level of complexity that would keep the players interest alive. Well, I am sure that we have succeeded in doing just that. Using a mixture of Metal Miniatures, Resin Buildings and Cards and Counters, there is very little note taking and working out involved as the counters and cards remove this aspect, and the player is free to work on the most important aspect of the game strategy, and this is what the game is really about!

At the beginning of the game all the players start with the same amount of pieces and the basic idea of the game is to grow your settlement faster than the other players, buying Figures and Buildings with game tokens as you go along, hopefully avoiding Natural Disasters and other unforeseen incidents.The game can be played by 2 or 4 players and is for Ages 14 and up and is fun for families as well as boardgamers  wargamers.

A great deal of time and effort was put into the design of the game pieces, which are very detailed. The same figures are used for each different tribe, which are just painted differently. Spears  Shields are cast separately, but come with the figures that they are intended for. The rules are well printed complete with a color cover, and are packed with black  white illustrations. The game tokens are printed in color, on white card.

To sum up, this was daunting but great fum to create, and to play-test, of which there were many games. There isn't a game like it on the market that I know of, and I know that those who buy a set are going to find it an appealing and tactical game. The more you play the game the faster it becomes and the more you will find that you have learned since the last time you played it.

Currently there are 2 expansions that add Shamans and water taskings:

- The Savage Seas 
- Out of the Wilderness

-  Draw or nominate someone else to draw from a deck of event cards.  This generally results in gaining or losing body parts for/from your Monstar.
-  take a card from another player's hand
-  Steal body parts from an opponent's freezer.
-  Steal body parts from an opponent's partilaly completed Monstar.

17325,Winner's Eye View,1995,6,1,3,2,6,120,120,,Racing ,,"Winner's Eye View is an auto racing game designed and published by a British race car driver and instructor.

The rules are fairly similar to those of the Avalon Hill version of Speed Circuit.  Cars are built by choosing levels of gearing, amount of fuel, type of tires, etc.  Speeds are chosen simultaneously on dashboards (which are also used to track fuel, tire wear, oil pressure, etc.) with maximum acceleration and braking amounts being observed (although you can exceed them if you roll for penalties).  Corners have maximum speeds posted in each space, although they can be exceeded for more penalty chart rolls or by staying on the racing line.  There are rules for slipstreaming and pitting.

The game elaborates somewhat on the basic Speed Circuit model.  It tracks wear separately for front and rear tires, has a few extra cornering rules, and has optional weather rules (this is where the different tire types come into play).  The movement is also more fine-grained than in Speed Circuit - here cars move one space for every 10 mph instead of for every 20 mph.

One track (Monaco) is provided on 10 A4 sheets which need to be taped together, and possibly trimmed.  Metal F1 cars are provided, as are metal arrows for the dashboard panels.

        Locations (green) are the places they go.
        Events (blue) are the plot twists that push the story and game along. 


Two Ways to Win:


     STEAL ALL 10 SHIKON JEWEL SHARDS!  You win the instant you control all 10 Shards. Shards are facedown cards that you both set aside when the game begins. You steal shards by defeating characters, attacking your opponent directly, and by using game effects.
     EMPTY YOUR OPPONENTS DECK!  You win the instant your opponent tries to draw or discard a card from his or her deck and cannot.


GETTING STARTED: First you need a deck of exactly 60 cards. The rules for deck building are easy: Unless the card restricts itself, you can have as many copies of a card you want.

Gorilla Warfare is a primal game of explosive jungle combat. Every player controls a team of four gorillas; armed with bulging muscles, bad tempers, and explosive Banana Grenades. The object? To be the king of the jungle, of course.

Gorilla Warfare is here and ready to play! The entire game took only 24 hours to create, but I tell you this; it almost ranks up there with Empires in playable fun. I always like moving my Gorillas around like a S.W.A.T. Team. No one can sneak up on you, and if anyone gets too close, all four Gorilla's are just about in equal throwing distance to fry the primate. Of course, this is a bad idea if an enemy has a Class 5 Banana Grenade, as the explosion can wipe out a good part of the play field...

Players are allowed up to one minute to answer the questions, whilst the other players may choose to agree or disagree with the answer given.  Correct answers result in movement of playing pieces and the receipt of Scoring Qs.

The first player to place his/her token on the sunburst and correctly answer an IQuest category question wins the game.

17353,Acquisition,1988,5,1,0,8,12,75,75,,Economic ,Co-operative PlayRoll / Spin and Move,"According to the rules Acquisition was created for The Shidler Group (a commercial real estate investment firm) by Prince Joli Kansil, presumably as an educational tool of some sort. It is not clear if it was ever published as such.

The game is designed for 12 players plus an umpire, but can be played by fewer (the rules only specifically mention changes for as few as 8 players). The umpire is not strictly necessary, but would make sense if the game were intended to be played by groups of children. The game is played cooperatively.

Each player has his or her own board. Each corresponds to a city or section of a city in the US, and is a stylized representation of one of its commercial real estate districts. Players move around their board by die roll (using the difference of two dice, not the sum) and can buy properties when they land on them. When a player rolls doubles they do not move, but all owned properties pay rent to the owner (from the bank).

There are a few other aspects to the system. When players buy or sell property they may do so at face value or may try rolling a 12-sided die to negotiate. Odds are they will do better this way but there is a chance they will do considerably worse. A player may travel to another player's board, which allows them or the other player to propose a joint venture, where both chip in to buy a property. Only the board's player gets rent, but since it is a cooperative game this is not an issue. Finally, there are spaces which cause players to draw event cards which do the usual sorts of things.

Play is for a specified amount of time - 75 minutes is suggested in the rules. At this point the net worth of all players is totaled, and if more than one group is playing (which would require multiple copies of the game), the one with the most money is the winner.

The players represent pirates who have deserted Captain Skull's crew and are trying to locate and steal his treasure, and escape, before Captain Skull returns, captures them and  makes them walk the plank.

Movement is controlled by the use of move cards which direct players to move a number of spaces in a given, or choice of given, directions (North, South, East and West).  In so doing players collect location cards, visit locations, and try and identify the whereabouts of keys which can be used to open Captain Skull's treasure chests.

On the video, which runs in real-time, Captain Skull will intervene to try and stop you finding his treasure.  His parrot 'Crossbones', on the other hand, will be trying to help.

The first pirate to find their treasure and escape the island is the winner, though other players should also try and locate their treasure and escape before Captain Skull's return (after 60 minutes)

17381,Count Coup: An Anthropological Board Game of North American Indian Ways,1979,6,4,1,2,4,60,60,,American Indian Wars American West Educational Environmental Fighting ,Roll / Spin and Move,"Warfare among the Plains Indians was mainly for glory.  Through many skirmishes a warrior could gain prestige and advancement within his own tribe.  A coup (pronounced 
koo) was a brave deed or act done against one's live enemy: touching a live, fallen enemy, stealing a horse, etc.  Upon completing this brave act, the warrior would return to his own tribe to recount for them the full details of his glorious deed--counting coup.

The information in Count Coup has been organized in two ways.  First, four large ecological areas can be seen in the map on the box cover: Eastern Woodland, Great Plains, Desert West, and Far West.  The tribes appearing on the playing cards are placed in their approximate areas on the map.  The colored border on the cards corresponds to the ecological area of the tribe referred to.

Second, the playing cards can be divided into 14 categories: Food-Plants, Transport, Dwellings, Leadership, Tools, Crafts, Hunting, Warfare, Person-to-Know, Trade, Ceremonies, Treating Ills, Social Control, and Tragedy.  Four cards appear in each category, one from each ecological area.  More information can be found for each of the 56 playing cards in the corresponding Explanation Cards, garnered during the course of the game.  These latter cards may be read aloud for a greater understanding of the cultures during the course of the game, or not if a faster game is sought, but the victor must collect four to accompany the movement of his pawns from the Summer Camp to the Winter Camp.

Hazard and Reward Squares corresponding to the Eagle, the Buffalo, Irrigation, and Fire will be encountered in the journey.  If rewarded, the player attends the Pow Wow, where he is temporarily safe.  A coup is made by landing on another player's pawn.

17383,Panzer Commander Afrika,2005,4.25,4,1,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Card Game Wargame World War II ,Co-operative PlayHand ManagementSimulation,"(from UGG's Website: P500 production)

This game is developed from the Collectible Card Game: Tank Commander: The Eastern Front Edition

Panzer Commander Afrika 1940/1941 is a two- (or multi-) player card game covering tactical combat in North Africa (Libya and Egypt) during 1940 and 1941. The game contains 220 cards that represent British, German and Italian forces.
Each vehicle card represents just one tank, half-track, or truck; each infantry card represents one squad of infantry; and each anti-tank gun card represents one AT-gun and its crew. Moreover, there are cards representing typical terrain, equipment and special events.

Each card depicts in full color either a single tank, an infantry squad, an antitank gun, typical terrain, equipment, and special events. 
A space on the battle board (your table top) represents roughly 500 by 500 meters and each shot equals five real shots. You will find that your playing time
closely approximates the time it really took to fight these battles in World War II.
PANZER COMMANDER AFRIKA 1940/1941 includes eight different scenarios.

Introductory Scenario: Tank Action (Tutorial), Sidi Barrani, 1940

Operation Compass, 1940
In December 1940 the British went over to the offensive and rapidly destroyed the Italian forces in Egypt and Libya.

Build Your Own, 1940

Sidi Rezegh, 1941
During Operation Crusader a wild armored clash took place at and near Sidi Rezegh.

Minefields!
A German armored force has run into a British position
Build Your Own, 1941

Free For All
In this scenario anything is possible - it is not even checked if a unit was available only in 1940 or 1941...

However, the scenario is great fun because all cards are used. In addition, only a minimum of preparation time is needed.
Panzer Commander Afrika uses the system of Tank Commander, The Eastern Front formerly published by Moments in History.

Panzer Commander Afrika is a complete, non collectible card game.

From the Box:

How well do you really know your partner?  Or best friend (or best friend's partner?)
Well now is your chance to find out.  You choose the subject, you choose the questions, analyze the points scored and then you'll find out (what you probably knew all along) if you're living with a Male Chauvinist Pig, a Right Wing Wet, a Left Wing socialist or just a plain slob.  Yes you'll discover the real man or woman in your life.

Contents:
Booklet
Subject Cards
Prediction Cards
Bonus Cards

A questioner selects a subject (e.g. indulgences, work) and reads out the three character descriptions from the booklet, appropriate to the interviewees sex. The players (including the questioner and interviewee) then vote (using prediction cards) on which type of characteristics the interviewee exhibits.

The questioner then selects 6 questions from the Subject Cards corresponding to the subject chosen.  The questioner then reads out the questions and three possible answers. Each answer scores either 1, 2 or 3 points depending on the response given by the interviewee - these points are noted down discretely by the questioner.

Once the six questions have been answered the points are totaled and the score related back to the character traits announced at the start of the round. The character of the interviewee is thereby determined.

Players that successfully predicted which character trait the interviewee would show score points. The winner is the player with the highest score after an agreed number of rounds.

Battlestorm requires an attacker to Declare any melee combat BEFORE he moves. This way the opponent has the option of counter-attacking, fleeing or even attacking some other unit. Combat can fire off an exciting chain reaction that suddenly draws many units into the fray. These are called battlestorms and they often mean a battle can hinge on a few critical decisions that cause an explosion of carnage. It's not for the faint-hearted, Battlestorm is designed for a bold commander who wants to feel the rush of adrenaline as his troops become enmeshed in a tactical chess match with all the violence and pageantry of a medieval fantasy battle.

Then everyone trades - trading is completely free-form, with no turns and no restrictions on deals.  When no one wants to trade any longer, the game ends and players add up the value of the items they have.

(Ownership of Red Barricades is required to play this game).

The northernmost of three huge factory complexes along the Volga, the Dzerhezinsky Tractor Works was an extended cluster of warehouses, office buildings and assembly halls built with the help of the Ford Motor Company in the 1930's to improve Soviet farming with modern tractors. The factory itself was bordered by an oil storage facility and worker' housing units. At the outset of the war with Germany, the factory was hastily retooled to make the soon-to-be-famous T-34 medium tank.

The steel ribs of the workshops stuck out amidst enormous mounds of rubble. The German 14th Panzer and 389th Infantry Divisions pounded the Guardsmen and smashed into the workshops of the factory itself for the first time. The factory had been busy, building and repairing tanks to the end, and the last T-34 tanks produced went into action unpainted. Now men cut each other down in brutal firefights staged at arm's length in the broken halls of the factory, while tanks sent shells crashing through the gloomy workshops in showers of sparks.

This is early war tank warfare with waves of B1 bis, H-39 and FCM 36 tanks sweeping into the village of Stonne with orders to force the issue and press the enemy back over the Meuse crossings.

Facing the threat of a collapsing front, the crisis facing the desperate French 2nd Army would be decided at the critical point at Stonne. If they could succeed and throw the Germans back across the Meuse, the enemy attack plan may well have failed. The German objective was to hold open the crucial Meuse crossings and seize the high ground at Stonne. Into this clash was drawn the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland, with its artillery and the attached Stu.Pi.Btl. 43. This elite formation would soon face waves of French tanks, including the heavy B1 bis, in heretofore unseen numbers in this classic and historic struggle.

Stonne 1940 includes a historical game map of the battlefield, special rules, six new scenarios, 32 die cut vehicle counters, and a Platoon Leader 2.1 campaign game.

Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10 and Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1 are necessary to play this game.


A second edition was published in 2007. The second edition included a redone map, which is significantly nicer than the map in the original module. Also, the extra campaign games from Critical Hit Magazine are now included in the 2nd edition,along with a full 16 scenarios.

A third edition was published by Critical Hit in November 2011. The third edition appears to include the counters required for play if you do not own Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10, but you still need to own Beyond Valor. It is unclear whether anything else has changed.

The British insisted that their airborne division take on the toughest assignment at the very point of the 60-mile salient which was Operation Market Garden. Montgomery said the operation was a 'springboard for a powerful full-blooded thrust to the heart of Germany.' But the plan had one fatal flaw: Allied intelligence had reported few German units in the vicinity of Arnhem--but it turned out that two SS Panzer divisions and Field-Marshal Walther Model, known as the 'Fuhrer's Firemen' were awaiting the British at ground zero. The one British battalion which was able to fight its way to the bridge was cut off, becoming 'a collection of individuals holding on' awaiting relief that would never arrive.

The Epsom Offensive: 28-30 June, 1944

SCOTLAND THE BRAVE tells the story of the BatUe 01 Epsom. Some histories pass over this battle as merely the second of Montgomery's failed attempts to capture the key city of Caen. Increasingly. however historians are  recognizing the true meaning of the Epsom Offensive. This was the battle which ended German dreams of driving the invaders back Into the sea. Hitler gathered the best of his remaining Panzer Divisions and broke them against the resistance encountered. The beginning of Epsom caught the enemy off balance and kept the Germans off balance until Hitler's counter-stroke in Normandy was doomed to failure. Most important, this was a battle in which enthusiastic but untried British troops stood toe-to-toe with some of the best equipped. best led and most experienced combat formations of the Third Reich. The Battle of Epsom was to set a pattern that was to continue for the rest of the campaign in Northwest Europe, from Normandy to the Baltic: the grinding-down of Hitler's elite troops by dominance in the air and by excellence of artillery support.

SCOTLAND THE BRAVE includes a well-researched historical game map of the battlefield, special rules, nine new scenarios and a Platoon leader 2.1 campaign game.

Object of the game

The object of the game is for each opposing force to reunite Yin and Yang. The Yin forces try to capture the Yang, and vice versa. Having captured the opposing force, the winner has achieved fulfillment, and the game ends.

Kung Fu, made in Singapore in the 1970's, is a chess-like game. Instead of a king or general, each player has a Yin/Yang monad and takes on the role of Yin or Yang, controlling a team of Kung Fu fighters (who are dressed in Karategi). The pieces are supposed to represent movements made during the performance of martial arts and have names like Front Kick (Eagle's Onslaught), Hook Kick (Whip of the Dragon's Tail) and Forward Punch (Fist of Fury). Probably influenced by Chinese Chess, each monad is restricted to their own temple of six squares and may not face each other directly in the same file. Unlike Chinese Chess, there is a Guardian piece which stands in front of the monad and which is not restricted to just the temple. However, within the temple, it has the unusual power that when captured within it's own temple, both the Guardian and attacker are removed from the board.

Kung Fu is a curiosity from the heyday of Shaw Brothers films.

17453,Die Tour,1981,6.3,15,3,3,6,60,60,,Card Game Racing Sports ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenCard DraftingModular BoardSimulation,"One of the most interesting bike race games with a Tour de France theme made ever, but unfortunately also one of the rarest, because only 300 boxes were produced by the authors in 1981. And thats a pity, because all the ingredient's of a great game are there.

Die Tour is a card driven game and all players have 15 cards (1 card = 1 turn) at the start, which they have to work with, until only 2 are left and the hand is filled up again to 15 cards. On these cards are four numbers (= number of fields, the drivers are allowed to move), one for each of the drivers, every team has at the beginning and sometimes special moves for special situations. Each number has to be attached to one of your drivers and the decision how to divide them, is yours.

Rules for group splitting, mountain races, single driver time races and slipstreaming are included in the basic game, but there exists an (even more rare !) advanced rules set, which the authors played with their gaming buddies. Besides various modifications to the basic version, this advanced rules set includes additional rules for group slowing, card exchanges, team time races and more.

Die Tour allows single races (about 60 minutes playing time and there are flat, mountain and time race stages) or an entire campaign game, which is a series of connected stages. Since there are various roads to victory (champion, best mountain driver, highest points and best team), the campaign game is of course the most interesting way, to play Die Tour, because it reduces the effects of luck. But the kings way, to play Die Tour, is to race a campaign game over many gaming nights and to give little prices to the winners in the different categories every evening and bigger prices for the final winners.

An extremely hard to find game, but if you see it somewhere (best chance probably : On flee markets in Berlin-Germany, because the authors are from there), grab it immediately, because you will not regret it !

When the move ends on a city the player pays a 'Landing Fee'. Most fees are 500 but a scattering of 10, 15, and 20 are purchased by the additional payment of the landing fee (a la Monopoly properties). Multiples of these will eventually allow doubling or tripling of fees for the other players.  The only need for reading German is for the 18 Uberraschungs (Surprise) cards. Plays continues until all but 1 player is bankrupt.

Space Marines is a game designed to simulate land combat in the interstellar era. It is a game based on small unit operations so that large battles cannot take place within the context of these rules. [...]

There are two different scales used in Space Marines, in effect, there are two different games here. The basic game uses a time scale of twenty seconds per turn and a normal ground scale of one inch equaling twenty-five meters. In the 'skirmish' rules the time scale is ten seconds per turn and a ground scale of one inch equaling 12.5 meters. The basic scale assumes that the players will have a significant number of figures on the table, possibly ten to twenty per player. The skirmish rules are intended for very small numbers of figures per player, no more than two or three under normal circumstances. The skirmish rules are almost entering into role-playing, although they do not constitute a full role playing system, just a combat system. [...]

Vatican, the board game, recreates the process of the worlds oldest election, a process with roots deep in the lives and careers of those cardinals who would aspire to the Papal office. Vatican, the board game, allows you the player to take the part of a cardinal and follow him through his life and career, through the run up to the election of a new Pope and finally, into the secret conclave of cardinals in the Sistine Chapel where the Pope is chosen. Vatican is a high-fidelity simulation of what it takes to become the leader of the Catholic Church. Vatican throws its players into the exciting ferment of issues, ambition, world politics, spiritual values and luck that make the election of the Pope both a rare and dramatic event. Vatican, the board game, asks you if you are smart enough and savvy enough and spiritual enough and lucky enough to win the votes of your Cardinal colleagues --- getting the answers to those questions is exciting, fun and probably the most enjoyable learning experience youre likely to have this year.

Vatican, the board game, allows you the chance to become Pope.

(Armageddon - The Strategic Fantasy Game)

This edition of the Armageddon rules (9th printing of the 3rd edition) is a classic piece of German war-gaming history. Very unlike the modern 'German Games' this is a strategic war game of epic battles and diplomacy set in the world 'Magira'. This fantasy world was described by its authors (chiefly Hugh Walker aka Hubert Strassl) in a series of popular German pulp novels.

It carries the tag line 'Das ewige Spiel' (the eternal game), as some particular sessions of this game have been played semi-continuously for the past 30 years by members of the associated society 'FOLLOW'. This version of the rules was published in 1990 by the EDFC (Erster Deutscher Fantasy Club e.V.).

The game's fascinating roots date back to the late 60's when Fantasy literature and war-gaming was virtually unknown in Germany. Society members started to imagine and describe various cultures for their shared fictive world, and enacted the history through the board game in sporadic sessions throughout the following years.

With this edition of the base rules (as well as several available supplements) everybody can enter the world of Magira and decide its fate in various levels of play, from tactical skirmishes to the simulation of a whole fantasy world.

Contents: 84 A4-Page Rules in 18 separate chapters with 8 maps of Magira. 1 square meter playing field and 521 counters on 24 A4 cardboard sheets.

Players will race to make scoring sets of five cards by combining pictures and colors in different ways.

Each player takes a deck and shuffles it thoroughly.  Decks are then passed to the left, so that each player uses a different deck than he shuffled.  One player calls Vamanos and the game begins.

Players draw one card at a time and place each in one of three rows on the table in front of themselves.  There are no turns and each player only plays in his own three rows as fast as he can.

When a player has five cards in one of his rows, he quickly gathers them in a small stack and pushes them to the side for later scoring.  New cards may placed in the now empty row.

When a player finishes, the game stops.  Rows that dont score and unused cards will penalize players.  The first player to 500 points wins.

A sneaky card game
for 4 or 6 players

Players will pick up and lay out cards, attempting to match four or five cards of the same value.  If a player  manages to do so, and secretly communicates it to his partner, they win the round.  If the player is caught with four or five of a kind by the opponents first, his team loses the round.  Each time a team loses, they get one or more letters.  When they get enough to spell LOSER, the other team wins.

Blox is a strategy game played with building blocks such as those manufactured by Lego(TM) and Tyco(TM). Players compete to construct a 3D chain of blocks on a base plate. Very simple rules lead to a surprisingly complex game.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to build a chain of their own blocks that connects all four edges of the board. All players could complete their own chains, so the first one to do so wins.

17545,Thinking in Circles,2004,0,0,1,2,2,45,45,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Print & Play ,Auction/BiddingPattern Building,"From the Invisible City Productions website:

A game of intuition and second-guessing for two players.

Object: To set three adjacent circles to your color, or to get three adjacent circles to match your secret shape sequence. You do this by outguessing what your opponent will play.

Each player writes down a sequence of three shapes. The only valid shapes are circle, triangle, square, and pentagon. On each player's turn, the player picks a circle to adjust. The player secretly picks a number of beads and put them in his hand. His opponent does likewise. Every white bead counts for one point. Every black bead counts for one negative point.

Reveal your beads simultaneously and add them up. This will give you a number from -6 to +6. Move the token in your chosen circle that many steps clockwise (for positive numbers) or counterclockwise (for negative numbers). If your total balanced out to zero, the token does not move.

If tokens in three adjacent circles are resting on shapes that match the player's goal, then he wins. Note that the order must match also. If his goal is circle, square, pentagon then tokens resting on circle, pentagon, square dont count. The sequence may be read forward or backward; square, square, circle is the same as circle, square, square. The current player also wins if tokens in three adjacent circles are resting on spaces that match his color.

Pattern placement and deduction for two to four players.

Object: Place tokens on a board to match patterns on your card or (even better) on your opponents card.

Give each player one pattern card. You may look at your pattern card, but keep it secret. On your turn, you get to roll and fill. Roll: (This step is optional, except that you must roll if the previous player filled a blank space.) Roll the die. Fill: Put a piece in a vacant space that shows the same number as the die. If there are no available moves, you may put a piece in a vacant blank space. If there is no vacant blank space to fill, then roll again. Play passes to the left. The game ends when all spaces are filled. When the game ends, you must reveal your pattern card.

Winning: Starting with the last player, each player takes turns 'lifting' (removing) one sequence of his or her tokens that matches one of the following conditions:

* If you lift your pattern, you get 4 points.
    * If you lift a straight line of 4, you get 5 points.
    * If you lift the pattern of the player to your left or right, you get 6 points.

Once all available patterns have been lifted, the player with the most points wins.

17548,Zombie Rancher,2003,5.04111,9,1.6,2,4,45,45,,Farming Horror Print & Play Zombies ,,"From the Invisible City Productions website:

A post-zombie apocalypse game of entrepreneur-ism for two or four players.

The zombie infestation of North America swept the United States like wildfire. Unchecked, zombie hordes destroyed the agricultural base; destroying fields, devouring cattle. Governments toppled as food resources became scarcer and scarcer. Quarantined by the rest of the world, it took 10 years for the survivors and governments-in-exile to wheedle support and aid from an international community filled with fear and skepticism.

Early in the process of containment, eradication, and reconstruction, a horrible secret was discovered: To supplement dwindling ration supplies, many survivors harvested and ate the corpses of the zombies they killed. Shockingly, zombie flesh was the most tender, tastiest, best-aged meat in the world. Preserved by the zombie disease while tenderized by necrotic bacteria, zombie steak made several black-market smugglers very wealthy. Serving zombie steak became an unusual, but chic, status symbol among the elite and wealthy outside North America.

Recognizing the demand for zombie steak, and desperate for revenue to rebuild the economy, the US government did not eradicate the last of the zombies, but herded them into federally controlled and regulated 'zombie ranches'. Each fiscal year, contractors bid for the right to harvest and process zombies from their local zombie ranch. You are one of the contractors lucky enough to land a rancher's contract. Your goal is to capture the finest, tastiest, and best-aged zombies and render them into juicy steaks and fillets.

Welcome to the world of Zombie Rancher.

Buy, outfit, and board ships, space stations, and space mills to become the richest prospector. It is not enough to find the raw materials. You have to bring them back to Earth and sell them successfully. This is only possible if there is a supply line (i.e. an uninterrupted orbital line from the raw material world back to Earth). Robot shuttles on the planets and asteroids carry the resources to the orbiting ships/stations at a rendezvous point. From there, a transfer to Earth is only possible when a supply line is available.

The game is set-up as a row of cards with each representing a planet in our Solar system. Each card/planet shows orbital paths for player travel and shows available resources which can change throughout the game - ore, biomass, energy, and water.

Each game includes:
91 playing cards
7 cards to cut and use as playing pieces

The designers suggest using 10mm dice as playing pieces, as only three are necessary for each player.

The robot is rotated to a particular question, and then lifted from the question area and placed in the center of the circular pattern of answers, whereupon the figurine auto-rotates to point to the correct answer.

The mechanics of the board simply consist of a magnet in the figurine and two magnets in the board. The question area sets the correct offset on the robot's magnet, and then the robot is allowed to freely rotate in the answer area to provide the corresponding alignment.

The game is essentially a trivial pursuit limited to eight sets of 14 questions with a wow factor for kids.

Merit also released a World of Sport version of the game which used an Olympic torchbearer to point to the right answer.

Chessword is an original game combining chess and words. All the chess pieces are used except the pawns, and they move and capture the opponent's pieces the same way as in chess. But instead of attempting to check the King, each player tries to gain all the letters of the chosen word before his opponent.

Played on a 8 by 14 chessboard with letters in the dark squares, each side has the normal complement of chess pieces, minus the pawns, and tries to form words by landing on the right letters on the board in sequence. Kings may be captured and the game is only won by completing the word, or capturing all of the opponent's pieces.

On his turn, a player must move one of his piece in any direction and as far as he wants provided it only crosses empty space and he lands on a space that is not of his own colour. All opponents pieces adjacent to the new destination space are captured (playing a move which captures the most pieces is mandatory). The player must then drop an opponent's piece (of the color which is not the one of the space he just landed on) on the board on any space he wants.

17588,Phwar,2003,3.66667,3,0,2,3,15,15,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"From the website :

Phwar (short for Phase War) is an abstract game of war for two or three players. The board is a hexagonal grid of hexagons. Each player owns four negative particles (electrons), four positive particles (positrons) and one neutral particle with zero charge (neutron).

The game is won by the last remaining player. All of a player's particles are removed if they do not have at least one electron, one positron, and one neutron on the board.

Players take turns moving one of their particles in any of the six hexagonal directions. The particle can move any number of cells in an unobstructed line. There is no passing unless a player has no legal moves.

An opponent's particle can be captured by replacement if: the victim is in line of sight of at least two of the current player's particles; and the total charge of all particles in the victim's line of sight cancels out to zero.

The idea is that such systems are unstable, but reach equilibrium after the capture.

It is compulsory to capture an opponent's particle if possible. The capture may be performed by any of the current player's particles in line of sight of the victim. The neutron may participate in a capture but contributes zero to the total charge.

You are one of the few ultra-violent psychos left on the planet. You and the other un-treatable freaks squeeze into the squishy cockpits of bio-engineered war machines to face each other in televised gladiatorial combat. You are a meat jock and this is Meatbot Massacre.

Meatbot Massacre is a tactical game designed by Greg Stolze (Hunter: the Reckoning, Unknown Armies, GODLIKE) with Daniel Solis (PUNK, Gears  Spears) to provide an optimal mix of game speed, ease of use, and tactical complexity. Meatbot Massacre uses an innovative dice mechanic in which your choice of die-type determines your actions. The dice do the talking.

The core mechanic takes only minutes to learn, but the tactics get more intricate as your meatbot rips power-ups from enemies and devours them. In other words, you can make the game as simple or as complex as you want: When you've mastered it at its simplest, you can crank it up without learning new mechanics.

17591,Mohawk,1983,7.11905,21,2.5,2,2,240,240,Wargames,Wargame ,Point to Point Movement,"Boardgame of the French and Indian War in North America.  Mounted, color mapboard measures 22 x 17.  Map features significant land and water routes used in the period.  Inset maps are included for high seas naval movement and tactical battle resolution.  176 two-sided mounted and die-cut counters represent regular and militia, Indians, fortresses and fleets.

Reinforcements from Europe are variable depending on naval activity.  Militia must be mustered, and go home at the end of each campaign year.  Natives are influenced by gifts and supplies and by battlefield victories.  Road, Indian trail and Water movement all have key roles in operations.

Battles occur between opposing forces occupying the same point.  Engagements take place on an inset map determined by terrain and situation: Attacking/Defending Fort, Open Ground, Wood (forested) or Landing.  Modifiers apply depending on whether engaged units are Regulars, Militia, or Indians, Rangers and Couriers de Bois.  Units engaging in battle line up opposite one another.  A hit is determined by a D6 roll of 6.  Die rolls are modified according to unit type and battle setting (Regulars defending a fort, for example, are plus 2, hitting on a four or better).  All units, except Iroquois, are flipped on the first hit and eliminated on the second.  At the start of his/her battle turn, a player may elect to retreat in lieu of firing.  Retreating units move to an adjacent friendly point, preferably toward their Base of Operations.  At the end of a victorious battle, flipped pieces are turned back to full strength, and one victorious militia unit, if present, may be promonted to a Regular or Ranger (British) or a Troop of the Marine battalion or Courier de Bois (French).

Fortresses can be built; Towns and Fortresses can be burned.  Supply is critical at the end of a campaign year; all Regular and militia units must occupy either a town or fort, or is not connected by a red road (not trail).  They  must be able to trace supply by road or waterway to their Base of Operations (Montreal or Quebec for the French; Boston, New York or Philadelphia for the British).  Regular or militia units which fail these conditions are eliminated unless they are in a seaport.

The powerful Iroquois Nation is key to victory.  Three of the six Iroquois tribes begin aligned with each side (the counters are two-sided).  After each battle, the victor of that battle flips one Iroquois unit to his/her side.  Any time a player begins his/her turn with all six tribes oriented to his/her side, the Iroquois have joined him/her for the duration.

The other twenty tribes are activated to support the French either by the activities of the Couriers de Bois, or by French bribes (gifts and supplies).  Except for the Iroquois, Native tribes usually go home after a victory (to celebrate).

Victory is determined by conquest.  The French must begin a turn, or end the game, holding Albany and one of New York, Boston or Philadelphia, or must deny the British their victory conditions.  The British must hold a total of three French cities from the list of Louisbourg, Frontenac, Duquesne, Montreal or Quebec (at least one must be Montreal or Quebec).

17600,Predators & Prey,1996,4,1,0,2,4,45,45,,Animals Card Game Educational ,,"The theme of this game is summed up in the title.  Players are dealt a hand of six cards, each depicting animals.  Each animal is labeled as either PREY or PREDATOR and has a numeric value based on its strength in the wild.  Players also have a playing piece that's actually a small plastic animal (my set has a zebra, a gorilla, an elephant, and a rhinoceros).

On a player's turn, she may either toss their hand and draw six new cards or play a PREY card face up.  Then, going 'round the table to the left, each player may play a PREDATOR card of equal or greater strength.  The next player in succession can only play if their PREDATOR card is of higher strength than any previously played predator.  Also, any predator played against the prey must also inhabit a common continent with the prey (color coded spheres on the cards--see, educational).

If no PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the PREY card moves forward the strength of that card.  If one or more PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the highest one played battles the owner of the PREY card via an on-board spinner.  A player spins and consults the difference in value between the predator and prey (four possibilities: 0, +1, +2, or higher).  Wherever the spinner stops, simply check to see the color of the difference in values.  If that number is yellow, the prey escapes, if it's red, the predator captures the prey.  The owner of the winning animal card moves forward a number of spaces equal to the PREY card's strength.

The spinner is divided into only five segments.  Four seem to be of equal size and the larger one (about 40% of the dial) is all yellow.  So, the odds are with the prey.  But with a more-than-plus-two differential, there's less than a 15% chance of escape.

At the end of a player's PREY turn, she replenishes her hand to six cards.

The movement track is 50 squares long.  First animal playing piece to the end is the winner.

This is probably not technically a children's game, but I think that's the audience that it suits best (though the idea of those cute little animals being captured by predators might be a bit much for some kids).

The game is designed for the 25mm figure scale, but because it has been designed with the revolutionary G.U.T.S. Core Rules, it could easily be adapted to 6mm, 15mm, or the 35mm figure scales... or anything else for that matter.

Before we describe the game's features, and offer the traditional list, let us take a brief moment to describe the G.U.T.S. Core Rules. G.U.T.S. stands for Generic Universal Tactical System. It is a revolutionary new game design, because it uses new models to create accuracy of simulation without adding dreary layers of useless rules. G.U.T.S. can be used for all sorts of miniatures-based games, such as WWI, the Civil War, and other conflicts, past and present. It has some other advantages, though, that are specific to Silent Dark:

Design your armies from the ground up. Every Creature, Vehicle and Weapon can be designed to your exact specifications, down to the last rifle in the last mans hands. Freedom rules!

Object: To find your opponent's treasure chest and return to your home base without getting blown up.

The game is played on game sheets that represent a three-dimensional playing area. Each player has his own sheet, while a third sheet is placed face-up on the table. This is the common map. You have one treasure chest and eight bombs to place on the playing field. Secretly choose an unoccupied square that that is on the same level as your home base for your treasure chest. Once you've placed your treasure chest, secretly place eight bombs by marking their locations on your private map.

On your turn, you have three choices of what you can do: step, scan, or defuse. Using these actions, you attempt to find your opponent's home base (where his treasure chest is.)

If you end your turn in your home square while carrying your opponent's treasure chest, then you win the game.

Since time can remember, monkeys in the Great Wood have quarrels over who truly rules the trees. Usually these territorial skirmishes led to a lot of ill-mannered screeching, which was very impressive but rarely decisive.

All of this changed when one enterprising monkey learned that a pulled-back tree branch could launch a breadfruit some distance through the forest. This discovery set off a chain reaction of intensified development into offensive and defensive forest technologies. The monkeys quickly learned that catapults worked better than pulled-back tree branches. Research into fortifications became necessary, as a means of defense against the constant rain of deadly breadfruit launched from catapults. All monkeys were issued saws in order to aid them in procuring the raw materials necessary for the war effort.

Today, as the sun rises over the Great Wood, a feeling of determination accompanies it. All the monkeys feel certain that when the sun sets in the evening, the ultimate ruler of the trees will have been determined, once and for all...

The playing board is comprised of 25 squares in a 5 x 5 grid.  Each square is further subdivided into 4 quadrants.  The squares are colour coded by colour and number so that a throw of the two dice (one numbered, one coloured) will indicate a particular square.

Taking it in turns players throw the dice and are asked a question determined by the colour of the square.  Questions are in five categories (Blue - Language, Purple - First, Red - People and Places, Yellow - Names, Green - Words).  Each player has a choice of three answers, only one of which is correct.

If a player correctly answers the question one of his or her playing pieces is placed on one of the quadrants within the square relating to that question.  The same player then continues with another roll of the dice and another question, until a question is answered incorrectly at which point play passes to the next player.

The first player to roll the dice and correctly answer questions to achieve at least one scoring piece in 5 squares forming a line either up, across or diagonally is the winner.

Though named the same and on the same subject matter, it is unclear if this is the same game as Origins, as the games appear to have different question and game-board styles.

Look for words that can be formed that use the tile you just played. Words can read up, down, left. or right, but must be in a straight line. Score one point for every letter in each word you find; palindromes count twice. If your tile set has blank or 'wild' tiles, declare what letter the blank represents when you play it. That tile continues to represent that letter for the rest of the game.

When you feel that you've found all the words you can, draw a tile and end your turn. Play passes to your left.

Covered With Glory is designed to reflect the tactics of the Napoleonic period at the level where those tactics had the most impact - the company and battalion. The unique movement and morale systems make the obstacles faced by officers of the period all too evident as players try to coordinate the movements of the units within their brigade or division. This is a fast paced, easy to learn, easy to play games system in which exciting and challenging battles can be played with as few as three or four battalions on each side or as much as a division.

This is not a game of high strategy. It is a game of tactics at a level too long ignored or simply not understood. It is a game about the common soldier and how he was led, maneuvered and deployed as he covered himself with glory.

Fire prevention cards are also used to recover lost lives with players using them before the five lives they are given at the start of the game are reduced to zero.

The player who is able to take the casualty through one of the two Fire Exits is the winner.

In 1600, deep in the valley of Charma, King Gambrel discovered a globe possessing mystical powers. He took the globe, which he named the Moonstone, back to his tower. Using the powers of the Moonstone, King Gambrel ruled long and wisely; however, four of his bravest knights became obsessed with the Moonstone and conspired to steal it.
King Gambrel discovered the plot, and using the Moonstone's supernatural powers he transformed the four knights into Dark Riders whose eternal task is to protect the Moonstone.
Recently, the Moonstone was rediscovered, still sealed away where King Gambrel had left it under the watchful eyes and powerful swords of the four Dark Riders. Only the most brave knights may challenge the Dark Riders for the possession of the Moonstone.
Dark Riders is similar to Pachisi or Sorry!, with mechanics in the rules to create blockades, or to send opponents back to start. Your goal is to get to the tower in the center of the board, retrieve the Moonstone, and return it to your starting corner of the board while avoiding the Dark Riders and the other players.

SOCIAL SECURITY is a new, novel, non-competitive game for family, classmates, church groups - or for any 'happening'.

SOCIAL SECURITY consists of a game board, six kinds of cards, a spinner, pawns, and a die.

Players, from six year olds to grandparents, will find themselves stretching their imaginations and practicing new communications skills.

Players move around the board drawing, reading, and commenting on mildly thought-provoking cards.  Some cards ask for an opinion on interpersonal issues, some present Ozzie and Harriet-type domestic problems then ask for possible solutions.  Certain squares direct you to spin a large spinner built into the game box that directs similar tasks (Share a time when you had good luck, Describe your favorite teacher)

The game morphs into a Christian version with the substitution of one deck of cards and the use of a spinner overlay.  New spinner directions are like Say something about forgiveness and the new cards have Bible verses and stick figure drawings of Jesus doing things.

Great concept, but the execution is a little mundane and unimaginative.

The map has a square grid with numbers along the X and Y axes, and each star and nebula has a number (numbers in the case of nebulae) which gives its position on the Z axis. Many numbered counters are provided to place with ships to show their Z-axis positions.

Two copies of the map are provided, allowing players in a two-player or team game to move their ship counters on the map simultaneously. After movement players compare their maps to determine which enemy ships are in range, and then write down firing and shield usage orders, which are again resolved simultaneously. Using weapons and shields costs energy, which must eventually be replenished at a home base or by borrowing from another ship.

Several levels of play are provided. The basic game is as described. The standard game adds several features - tracking (ships are placed face-down on the map and only revealed when successfully probed), hyperspace movement (conducted off-map), carrier ships, etc. The advanced game adds a few more features, notably supply points, and more importantly allows players to create their own ship designs (ships in the advanced game have 21 different components, allowing for considerably customization).

There are a few optional scenarios, including one which allows for up to four individual players (this requires either additional copies of the map, or some players to write down their moves). Four players can also play the standard and advanced game scenarios in teams, as the forces each contain two different groups of ships.

The original version of the game was published in 1971. A second, presumably revised version was published in 1977.

Nebula 19 was rated Best SF Space Tactical Game by The Space Gamer magazine's 1979 Game Survey.

You must be wary, as should your opponent, of being attacked from either above or below, as well as the other two dimensions.'

This chess game differs from a regular chess game in that it has three transparent boards stacked on top of each other. One player will start with his pieces on the top board, the other will have his pieces on the bottom board.

After their initial move, a piece automatically moves to the middle plane (with a few exceptions: a king or rook may remain on the same plane, as can a piece needed to prevent checkmate). From there on, each player can make a regular move or ascent or descent a single level (moving to the same square on a different level). When moving up or down, it is not possible to capture opposing pieces.

This game was developed to fill a need in the sports game market.  Our goal was to develop a realistic football game that could be played anywhere in a relatively short time by almost anybody.  Yes there are some very realistic games out there, but they are too complicated for a lot of people to play, such as a father and a son.  Other games are simpler, but they leave out the drama and agony of tough calls (go for it or punt?).  We feel we have met our goals with Tabletop Quarterback.  You can play a game and keep full statistics in less than an hour.  Some of the experts who developed this game have been trounced by wives and 11 year old kids.  We think youl like it and get caught up in the action just like we have.

Overview:
Basic football rules apply; things like 4 tries to make 10 yards, 6 points for a touchdown, 3 points for a field goal.  The risks are here: such as the probability of making a long field goal, an unexpected turnover, a drive-killing penalty.  Usually, sound football savvy will get you through.  But don't be afraid to make some chancey calls as they can work and really turn a game around.

Call play, both players roll dice, compare results to chart.  Repeat as indicated by rules.  Game is over after 4 quarters.

In essence it's a dungeon crawl game like Warhammer Quest using tables to generate the dungeon and events. It can be played with or without a game master. For game master-less play it offers reaction charts to control how opponents handle themselves.

There are instructions on how to customize the game to use elements from other games, like the board tiles from Warhammer Quest.

The hourglass shows how much time you have to place the block shown on the card. If the tower is still standing after you have placed your blocks, play passes to the next player who now has to extend the tower in the same way.

Special cards add extra difficult situations. For example, you might have to drop your block on top of the last placed block, or to switch a block already in the tower with another block.

The player that knocks the tower over loses the round, and everybody else gets a marker. First player to collect 5 markers wins the game and becomes Blockster master.

Mythmatical Battles is a dueling card game for two players or two teams. It blends mythology and multiplication to create an innovative game which lets kids drill multiplication while engaging in epic mythological battles.  For the first time education is infused into the wildly popular dueling/ collecting card phenomenon. Welcome to a FRESH TWIST ON FLASHCARDS with this fun new MULTIPLICATION GAME!
 Each player uses his own Mythmatical Battles Deck, with 55 cards featuring gods, heroes, and monsters from Greek, Celtic, Norse, or Egyptian mythology. Every card has one multiplication equation for its attack strength and one equation for it's defense strength. A single deck contains all the multiplication equations from 1x1 to 9x9.

The players take turns drawing cards from their decks, placing them face-up to the Field (known to grown-ups as the table, desk, or floor), and challenging their opponent's cards.  The card with the highest product wins.  But look out --Magic and Weapon cards can change card strengths, and weaker cards can team up to conquer a powerful card.

Each defeated opponent's card goes into the player's Plunder pile. The game ends when one player's deck is exhausted. The player with the most cards in her Plunder pile when the game ends, wins.

A full deck game takes 45 minutes to play. Or you can play time limit games to fit into a busy class or home schedule. To win a time limit game the person with the most cards in his Plunder pile when time's up wins.

Mythmatical Battles is designed for kids in the 3rd to 6th grade. Any kid (and there are millions) who's played with other dueling cards will easily catch on to the rules of Mythmatical Battles, plus learn classic mythology and rock solid math.

Components:

Gameboard - with an outer track depicting 28 composers and a central wheel containing a list of actions (forfeits / bonuses etc).
28 Composer cards - each depicting a composer and matching one on the board. Each is colored coded to represent the lengths of different musical notes and has a number from 1 to 6. Each card also has a short biography of the composer, but this is not relevant to the game.
6 playing pieces - each representing a different musical instrument (harp, violin, trumpet drum, piano and saxophone)
1 colored die - each face has a different color and musical note
1 numerical die - D6
Paper money - in 6 colors - each with a musical symbol and name (as for the composers and colored die).
Money converter card - this gives the relative value of the each color of paper money.

Players throw the two dice which determine a position (composer) on the board to which the players playing piece is moved (i.e. 5 Green is Dvorak). Money is also earned according to the same dice roll - 5 Green means that 5 pieces of green money are received.

If the Composer is owned by another player then a forfeit must be paid. If not the Composer may be bought.

During his turn a player may also purchase up to 10 pieces of music from each Composer that they own.

A supplementary action (forfeit, movement or bonus) is also determined from the inner wheel based on the same dice roll (5 Green for example is Pass to Bach).

Play proceeds in such a way - move, receive money, purchase a composer/pay a forfeit, purchase works, central wheel action - until one player has purchased 6 Composers - one in each color and amassed 10 pieces of music from each of the composers owned.
An advanced version of the game introduces a quiz book round in which players are also asked to attempt a definition of a musical phrase or term. A correct answer results in earning more money.

Throwing four of a kind (a quadruple) wins outright, even on the first throw.
A triple, regardless of the number thrown allows a move of 36 spaces.
A perfect sequence (1234, 2345, 3456) allows a move of 48 spaces.

Some squares contain special instructions that must be followed.  These include instructions to throw again or move to another square.

On arrival at sector 144 each space ship there qualifies for three throws of the dice.  After each throw the player may pick up or leave down any dice in choosing to go for a quadruple or perfect sequence within those three throws.  Each time a quadruple or perfect sequence is thrown one ship may be placed on the space representing the Center of the Galaxy.

The first player to get all three of their ships to the Center of the Galaxy is the winner.

Object: To form specific combinations of cards by selecting them from a common pool of face-down cards.

Play is simple: Scatter a Poker deck face-down on your playing surface. Set a timer for one minute. Start the timer.

There are no turns; all players act simultaneously. Your goal is to search for the cards that you need (combinations and penalties are listed on printable reference cards) while abiding by the rules of the game (only use one hand, only hold one card at a time, move cards you want to your 6-card-max stash, move cards out of your stash that you don't want, and don't touch other players during the game.) All play stops when the timer rings. If you have a card in your hand when the timer rings, youre stuck with it whether you want it or not.

Once play has stopped, reveal your stash. Compare your stash to the Combinations and Penalties reference cards. If you have the highest score, you win.

17778,Liaisons,1992,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,,Deduction ,Roll / Spin and Move,"LIAISONS - A game of imagination, mime and detection.

Every player is dealt one Boy and one Girl Personality Card and imagines that, unknown to everyone else, the couple are involved in a secret liaison.

Each player is dealt one boy and one girl from the decks of cards and invents a situation as to how the liaison (between, for example, Captain Kirk and Madonna) began.  This introductory story must contain some clue to one or the other (or both) of the liaising personalities, but not be so vague as to be meaningless.  Successive questioning through the game must contain additional clues.  Any information provided is recorded by all the other players on Probe Sheets.

The Probe Sheets contain a list of permitted questions (e.g. What did he first say to her) that may be asked during the course of the game. The questions that may be asked are determined by the movement of playing pieces on the board, which comprises three concentric rings.

Additional information may also be gained through the use of Chance cards or Acting Up - in which players are required to act as another celebrity, but in the style of either the boy or the girl of their liaising couple.

On certain squares it is permitted to attempt to guess the names of the liaising couple for one of your opponents - this is done in secret by writing on a scrap of paper.  The challenged opponent will then award markers for correctly guessed personalities.

The first player to unmask all the liaisons of all of his or her opponents is the winner.

Of the 10 titles, one is a Wall, that can block movement of opposing tiles. Another is the King / Queen, which can move in any direction. All other tiles have restricted rules of movement, for example, one tile can only go forward and to the right.

In a turn, a player may either move a tile as allowed by that tile, or can rotate by 90 degrees the square tile, so that in a following turn, the player can move the tile in a different direction.

The game ends when a player sucessfully surrounds the opposing King / Queen and prevents its movement.

17790,Hof,1975,2.5,1,0,2,3,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Dice ,Dice RollingPattern BuildingPattern Recognition,"Hof, at its most basic, is a 4-in-a-row game for two or three players, on a 6x6 board, using coloured dice as playing pieces. At its most complex it becomes a game in which players use identical sets of dice that all need to be manoeuvred into a sequential row, using the eyes to determine movement range.

At the start, players roll their own colour dice (6 in a two player game, 4 in a three player one). Then, in turn, players position these dice on an empty board space, one by one, and never altering the face value. When a player manages to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of 4 own dice, that player wins the round. The victor scores the total pip count of these dice, or the best dice string if the created row exceeds its required length. When all dice are on the board, and no row has been completed, players may move one own die per turn to an adjacent space, but not diagonally. The aim is to score the most points over a given number of rounds.

Anyone vaguely familiar with placement games won't find this much of a challenge, and for these players a couple of trickier variant rules are suggested. Any combination of these variants can be used, to eliminate randomness and increase complexity as desired.

- (2 player only:) to win, a row of 5 or even 6 is needed. 
- players don't start by throwing the dice, but use identical sets instead (1-6 or 1-4).
- a winning row also needs to have the dice in the correct sequence, low to high.
- dice may be moved as many squares as their face value, allowing directional changes too.

The designer isn't credited, but in all likelihood it is Hans-Jörg Nürnberger, as Hanje was the vehicle for Hans-Jrg and Ursula Nrnberger's own designs.

A translation of Uwe Petersens short description on the Spiel des Jahres-site:

First you draw 10 out of 120 face-down letter tiles. Then you try to create words by using as many of them as possible within 5 minutes time. The points of the tiles  depending on the chosen difficulty from 1 to 3  are written into your score-board. The score for the longest word is doubled. Then you draw 5 more tiles, combine them with your old tiles to new words and score them again. In a third round you again draw 5 tiles, create words as long as possible with your 20 tiles, score them and determine the winner by adding all points together. With these simple rules Gilbert Obermair (who left the jury of Spiel des Jahres) created one of the funniest word-games of the last time.

The description of the game that appears on the inside of the box lid:

As many persons can take part, as there are pigs in this extremely interesting and amusing game, which holds the players and onlookers spellbound with excitement, from beginning to end.

The game is set up, as seen on the picture.  The players then deposit money or counters in the pool.

The pigs are placed, with their hind legs on the lowest step of the planks.  At a given signal they proceed, step by step, up the plank, by the aid of the string, which the players must pull lightly.  If the string is pulled too hard or violently the pig will tumble and fall from the plank, which necessitates going back to the starting point, thus rendering the game very exciting and making the fun fast and furious.

At first many of these 'accidents' will happen, but with a little more practice, the player becomes adept and the pigs make splendid progress.  The player, whose pig arrives at the trough first, is declared winner and accordingly takes the stakes.  Throughout the game the pigs must not be touched by the hand.

Unfortunately at times the dice can favor the fielding team and wickets can drop very quickly after some lucky rolls.

Any row containing red can only be taken up to the red. A blue ball allows players to take up to, or part of, three entire rows radiating from that blue. Other blues in the path are treated as regular silver balls. The player with the last ball loses.

The aim of the game is to visit four places in the city (determined by a deal of destination cards) whilst avoiding dangerous areas such as dark alley or parks.

Prior to commencing their journey players may elect to undertake training in the martial arts thereby providing them with a better chance of defining themselves against any dangers that they may come across during that journey.

When they decide to start players move around the game board as the result of a roll of a D6.  On landing on a Risk square a card is drawn and the instructions on that card followed (i.e. go back 4 spaces, go to the nearest Streetwise space...).

On landing on a Streetwise space a card is drawn which presents the player with a scenario such as being faced by one man with a large stick.  The player then has the option of running away (normally the best course of action) or staying.  The results of the encounter are determined by the choice made and the level of self-defense training achieved by the player.

The first player to visit his/her four destinations and return the the Bus Depot (start) is the winner.

If the question is answered incorrectly, the turn ends.  It should be noted that there are family questions for older players and junior questions for younger players.

If a player lands on one of the four Dudley Dodo squares (there is one for each category/colour) he is similarly asked a question of the appropriate category.  A correct answer at this point earns one piece of the four-piece Dudley Dodo jigsaw.

The environment square requires players to draw a card and follow the instructions (miss a turn, gain/lose a Dudley Dodo card, etc.).

The first player to successfully collect all four pices of the Dudley Dodo jigsaw wins the game.

You Need:

* A piecepack set
    * Pen and paper

The object of Castles is to collect the most gold over a predetermined number of rounds (equal to the number of players, one different a player starts each round). You must place your castle nearest most valuable resource tiles and try to avoid hostile tiles, which deplete the gold you collect from the region. To control tiles you must deploy your armies over the terrain. To count your gains you must attend the tile where you placed your castle and four orthogonally adjacent tiles to that tile.

After all rounds, the player with the most gold wins.

Trap other pieces between your own to capture them but be aware that the opponent may do the same. Pieces will change sides (colors) dozens of times. Points are scored every time a chip is flipped, as opposed to OTHELLO where it is only at the end points are scored. Each player also has a STOP chip and two DOUBLE chips. The STOP chip is undetectable when played and only shows itself when the opponent attempts to flip it. The DOUBLE chips always show and it doubles the points scored in that row when it gets flipped. If there are two DOUBLE chips in a row being flipped the score is quadrupled. There are handy thumb wheel scoring devices for each player attached to the games board as well.

It is, except that your opponent has a Home and a Station too, and is trying to run trains on the same tracks. Your opponent will be turning the switches so that the paths run in a different direction. This is why you and your opponent are always at Cross Purposes!

17858,Rise of the Red Army,2001,2.83333,3,0,2,7,0,0,Wargames,Civil War Economic Wargame ,Area MovementDice RollingVariable Player Powers,"The Rise of the Red Army is a territorial strategy game covering the Russian Revolution following World War I. Historical representation of the Bolshevik, Siberian, and Crimean factions, including the Polish invasion of Russia, Japanese occupation, and independence movements from Finland and the Baltic States.

The game comes in a small box, with two large folded (very folded) semi-laminated maps. The components are plastic poker chips with stickers the players affix themselves.

The rules are closely based on Axis and Allies. Each player plays one or more nations, each varying in size and power. There is much greater variation in starting power and capabilities in this game than there is in Axis and Allies. The Bolsheviks control numerous units and a vast swath of territories, while other nations begin with only a handful of each. This imbalance in power is offset by the setting of different victory conditions for each nation. Furthermore, the victory conditions vary depending on how many players are playing and what nations they each control.

Resource collection rules are basically the same as Axis and Allies, (the generic resources are equivalent to the IPC's from Axis and Allies, i.e. each territory is worth a certain number of resources) with slight variations for some nations. For example, the Northern and Crimean White Russian forces gain extra resources if they keep control of their ports (representing aid from the U.K., U.S., and France), while the Bolsheviks and Ukrainian Anarchists gain extra resources from any of the core Russian areas they control (representing support from the local populace).

Combat rules also follow Axis and Allies, with some extra rules for trenches (which aid defense), bi-planes (very weak in the game), generals (who can add their combat factors to any units they share an area with when attacking or defending), etc. Ten-sided dice are used for combat. Certain nations, such as the Bolsheviks, Poles, and Ukrainians, have more effective infantry than others. The handful of Czech infantry controlled by the Siberian White Russians also gain bonuses in combat.

After combat, players must spend resources to incorporate the territories they conquer. Only after a territory has been incorporated can the new owner collect resources from it.

The number of territories on the map is enormous. This increases tactical opportunities, but it would seem that this could make resource collection somewhat onerous for some nations. While the Poles begin the game with 31 resources, the Bolsheviks begin with 306! Of course, the Bolsheviks are under attack from nearly every direction, so they need the bonus.

A grand campaign scenario enabling the players to fight the war in the West or East is provided with each game.  Both games may be combined for a grand campaign game that simulates the entire Civil War on both fronts.

Each game contains the following components:
1) One 22' x 28' mapboard covering the eastern or western portion of the United States.
2) 400 die-cut playing pieces.
3) A rules booklet.
4) A scenario booklet.
5) One player-aid and leader display card.

Each hex represents about 12 miles.
Each strength point represents approximately 2,500 men.

Additional information:

Game features alternating player turns including interception movement by the non-phasing player, leaders required to move infantry, special rules for naval and amphibious operations, supply, railroad construction and repairs, a combat system featuring morale and leadership and a campaign game combining both the Potomac and  the Tennessee games. The campaign game also adds politics and production to the mix.
Turns are monthly, except for the winter turns (November to February), which are bi-monthly.

The game ends when one player has no pieces left in play or in hand, or if there are no pieces on the board and all players have taken a turn.

If you have the most pieces in your capture cup at the end of the game, you win.

These tiles have the very interesting property of tiling the plane aperiodically - that is, they cover the plane completely without repeating their pattern as do triangles, squares, hexagons, etc.
The tilings have many other properties of mathematical interest which can be read about in one of Martin Gardner's books, among other places.

Kadon sells a nice set of these tiles which can be used for making patterns and solving puzzles, but also includes a board and rules for a game that can be played with them.

Players Command Their Own Fleet. Fire Away...Sink Ships...Capture Islands. And Become...the King of the Sea.

Game board is a plastic three-dimensional base in two parts depicting a sea dotted with islands. Each player has five ships which are moved from sea area to sea area in an effort to capture islands. After each move, the player gets to fire cannon balls from spring-operated cannon in an effort to knock down opponent's ships or island bases.

The winner is the first player to capture five islands or sink all of the opposite side's ships. (Note that you will generally be capturing islands on your side of the board.)  (But, that doesn't mean that you CAN'T capture an island on your opponent's side of the board.  It's just harder to do as you get closer and closer to your opponent's cannon.)

Four player game is simply team play with one player on each side taking the role of gunner and the other moving the ships.

The game shares some characteristics with Ludo/Parcheesi, except with two moving tracks and cards instead of dice.

Roughly translated from Jurgen Herz's description on the Spiel des Jahres site:

http://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/spiel/1983/fuzzi.html

On a small round track made from plastic rails, run two trains, each with five cars.  Each player receives four passengers - colored wood pieces - who must be brought to their destination station.  A passenger can only board a railroad car if the vacant car is directly before their entering space.  Once a passenger is on their way, it may happen that the railroad car stops at a changeover station.  Then the passenger must leave and wait for the next free railroad car to come by.  The movement of the trains is determined by small colored cards, which are drawn from a deck.  Since one can choose which of the two trains one moves, here begins the tactical possibilities of this game, which lift it above the mass of simple dice games for children.

Remembering those matches rewards you with some strategy for two to four players.

Object: To end the game with more tokens than everyone else. You do this by turning cards of the same rank face-up during your turn.

You Need:

* A poker deck (with the Jokers removed).
    * About 30 tokens for each player.

On your turn, select two cards and look at them. If the two cards are the same rank (like two Fives) and are both Black, show the cards to the other players and choose a player to return that many tokens to the Bank. If the two cards are the same rank and are both Red, show the cards to the other players and choose a player (including yourself) to gain that many tokens from the Bank. If the two cards are the same rank and are different colors, show the cards to the other players and refer to the Mixed Chart [which is included in the rules.] Once the effect has resolved, set the cards aside in the discard pile and end your turn.

If the two cards do not match, put them back in their original spots, face-up. You can choose to put one or both of them back face-down, but you must give one token to the Bank for each card that you don't reveal. Once you've made your decision and shown (or not shown) your cards, your turn ends.

If you run out of tokens, you're out of the game.

The game emds when only one player has tokens left, or when all possible matches have been made. If you have the most tokens at the end of the game, you win.

From the Box:

Ponies, as it is popularly called in our family, was invented heres (Sway) in the New Forest in about 1985 to keep our children quiet on wet days.

Firstly we wanted an interesting game for younger children that was not contentious and would not end in arguments and tears.  Ponies was based upon a drive in the New Forest, taking the routes to our favorite walks.  Players had to collect the Ponies found on the road, and get ten back to their Corral, avoiding the usual hazards of Forest roads.

Then, finding that we adults also wanted to play, we made it more interesting with scope for an element of low adult cunning.  Enter the Verderer and Game Licenses; and Ponies was born in its current form.

The game is ruled by the throw of dice, but the Chase Cards introduce scope for planning and strategy and generate suspense and excitement.  The lucky early leader rarely wins, and the ultimate winner has to run the gauntlet of determined Verderers so that often it is the last throw of the dice which decides the victor between three or four neck and neck contenders.

My family and all our friends have been playing it ever since, both adults and children have remained addicted over the years.  Bowing eventually to everyone's enthusiasm we have at last decided to go public with Ponies: we are certain you are going to become as ardent Verderers as the rest of us!

17936,Billy Hamilton's Football Academy,1985,3,1,0,2,6,0,0,,Sports ,Roll / Spin and Move,"FOOTBALL ACADEMY is designed as a journey through the life of a professional footballer (soccer player).  The game is designed by a former professional player - Billy Hamilton.

The game is conducted in three phases:

The Apprenticeship - three (game) years of learning the skills and demands of being a footballer, as well as performing the thankless, but necessary, tasks essential to the everyday running of a football club.  This apprenticeship is the foundation upon which the professional career is built.

Professional Footballer - As a professional, the player strives to maintain a high standard, on and off the pitch.  He becomes more involved in duties outside the game and must lend himself to charitable and promotional work.  His good performances on the pitch may lead to international recognition.

Gain International Caps - It is the dream of every player to play for his country and win the World Cup.

The Apprenticeship stage is conducted by undertaking three circuits of the outer board based on a roll and move mechanism.  Activities are driven by the actions required of the squares on which the playing piece lands.  After completing three circuits any Skill and Effort tokens earned are traded in for a potential rating which determines which of four paths that player follows through the Professional Stage.

Progress through the Professional Stage is, once again, dependent on the roll of the dice with the effects of the square being detailed in look-up tables contained in the rule book.  The idea is to proceed to the International Stage as quickly as possible, collecting goal tokens on the way.

During the International Stage players roll two dice (one advantage, one penalty) to progress.  Dice rolls can be modified by the trading in of goals gained during the professional phase.

The winner of the game is the first player to enter the World Cup Winner zone at the center of the board.

Is this going to be a stand-up fight, sir, or another bug hunt - Hudson

These rules are inspired by the films Aliens (tm). They can be played solo as the Aliens are all generated by dice rolls. Two possible games can be played:

(1) The players are Colonial Marines who are exploring a base where a group of colonists have settled. Earth has lost all contact with the colonists. The marines are sent to check the base out.

(2) The Colonial Marines are planet side defending a group of settlements where contact has been made with the bugs.

Further scenarios may be created too if preferred, use the films for ideas. Any scale of figure will do from 10mm to 25mm, a collection of D6 are required. Measurements used are by squares if using floor plans otherwise substitute inches for squares.



System makes use of standard action point allowance.  Players control colonial marines in a randomly generated hulk.  Aliens are either game master controlled or on auto-pilot (they are after all perfect killing machines).  Lots of room for back story and role-playing aspects, in fact the game probably plays better in this fashion.

In it, you will play a warlord trying to dominate Arcana, using a variety of troops to conquer your enemies. As you build up your empire, you will be able to collect more gold and mana, allowing you to build still stronger structures, support larger armies, and cast more powerful magic.

It was designed to be simple to learn and fast-playing, but there are many roads to victory and strategies can be complex. Some players strive for magical supremacy, allowing them to cast enormous amounts of spells per turn, including collapsing enemy structures or destroying entire armies in rains of fire. Some build networks of gates, providing enormous flexibility in maneuvering troops and giving a boost to income. Some try to rapidly build castles up in their territories, giving great bonuses to defense and income, while allowing many dragons to be recruited per turn. Still others simply strive for rapid conquest, using basic infantry and cavalry to their best effect and depending on large land holdings to pay for their armies.

Empires of Arcana was also built for flexibility. Two different ways to play come with the game, including an aggressive goblin scenario that puts player cooperation to the test and is perfectly suited for solitaire play.

The game continues until one nation has dominated the world or there is a stalemate with the entire industrial production of the world reduced to rubble.

Near the turn of the 19th century, there was a significant shift in the way war was conducted. Prior to this time, war was waged between the armies of nations, while the general populace and the largely agrarian economies of the nations involved were affected indirectly. The onset of the industrial revolution provided new weapons of such variety, power and cost that those who waged war could no longer afford to ignore the economies and the peoples they warred against. At this time, the scope of war expanded to include every facet of a nations ability to produce. War in its various forms spilled over the battlefields and into the factories and lives of everyone. This new kind of war took place on a scale never before seen with weapons never before imagined. This was the dawn of Total War.

17990,Hitting the Wall,1985,4,1,0,2,6,0,0,,Sports ,Roll / Spin and Move,"HITTING THE WALL is a simple roll and move boardgame with the theme of running the Marathon.

The board is divided into three parts 
- an outer training circuit
- the Marathon course
- The Wall

Players have one playing piece which is used on the training circuit and Marathon course, and a counter which is used when they Hit the Wall.  Each player is also provided with a training schedule on which their training progress is recorded.

Players start the game by undertaking training which is conducted on the training circuit.  They complete one lap of the training circuit, based on the results of dice rolls.  The type of square landed on (e.g. hill training, training injury, new shoes etc..) is recorded on the training record, so that by the time that training is completed players will have had differing experiences as a result of their training.

Once all players have completed their training the Marathon race itself commences.  Play progresses one throw at a time with penalties being dictated by the square on which the piece lands.  Some penalties apply to all players, others only if the penalty is applicable to one of the events experienced during training (e.g.  Into the wall for injury would only apply to a player who had been injured during training.)  Once the penalty is spent the training incident is canceled on the training record.

Many of the penalties involve hitting the wall -  that part of the Marathon where running becomes particularly difficult and you wonder whether it is all worthwhile.  In the game this represented by having to complete a circuit of the 20 space wall.  The main playing pieces remains where it is on the Marathon circuit and the other counter is used to mark progress around the wall.  Once the wall has been overcome the player may continue moving the runner on the Marathon track.  The wall can be beaten by doing a complete circuit of the 20 spaces or by sacrificing any combination of two benefits (20 milers, hill training, drinks station) earned during the training session.

The winner is the first player to reach the finish of the Marathon.

Players each start with an astronaut on the board's outer track, and roll a single die. The astronaut is used to collect the six components needed to build a rocket, as well as other game effect cards.

Once a player has all six cards, he may then roll two dice: a red die to move his rocket on the inner board, and the white die to gather the components for more rockets. A player may have up to two rockets in space at any one time.

Players score days in space by passing over the green spaces marking planets and other interesting features within the solar system. Some cards and spaces also allow a player to score.

Some cards and board spaces may be used to move your own rocket to your advantage, or another player's rocket to their disadvantage. The board contains three dead-end spaces pathways (burn-out, Uranus, and the Sun) that penalize a player as well as destroying his rocket.

18008,Name That Country,1992,3.41667,6,0,2,4,0,0,,Educational Travel ,Roll / Spin and Move,"NAME THAT COUNTRY is a childrens' geography game Ages 7 - 12

The gameboard incorporates a spinner listing 60 Countries and their respective Continents.  Players take it in turns to spin the spinner and then identify on the map the location of that country - this is done by calling out the appropriate number from a map and then cross-referencing it to a look-up table.

A correct answer earns a number of movement points which are used to move playing pieces around the board.  Many of the spaces on the board show postage stamps from various countries - these have no effect on play.  Other squares, however, contain special instructions (move forward 1 space, go back 3 spaces etc...) which must be followed.

Certain squares have a depiction of a postcard.  If the piece lands on one of these spaces then a postcard is drawn from a deck and read aloud.  The language and greeting, and the name of the sender, are clues to the identity of the country from which the card is sent.  If the player correctly identifies the country then the playing piece is advanced a further two spaces.

The first player to complete one circuit of the board (35 spaces) is the winner.

Any number of players may participate but the playing pieces represent two teams of 11 (10 field players and a goalkeeper), as in Soccer.  Teams take it in turns to move their players and the ball.

The movement of players and the ball is determined by the roll of two D6 in the colours of the two teams (blue and red).  Either one playing piece, or a combination of pieces are moved forwards, backwards, sideways and diagonally the number of spaces corresponding to the score on the dice of the colour of that player's team.

After the players have been moved the ball is then moved (assuming that a players piece is next to it) the number of spaces shown on the combination of both dice.  The flight of the ball is affected by the direction in which it is kicked and the presence of friendly or opposing players in its flight path.

Particular rules apply to the kick off, kicking the ball in the air, dribbling, free kicks, penalties, throw-ins, goal kicks and corners.  Even the infamous offside rule is included.

To score a goal, the player must kick the ball across the goal line between the two posts.

The winning player (team) is the one that scores the greatest number of goals with in a pre-agreed time limit, or is the first to reach a pre-agreed number of goals.

The game involved picking the top cards from stacks of overlapped face-up cards (so you could see what choices your pick would free up later), and scoring points thereby. The other catch is that the cards have different values in different rounds of the game, so there are a number of timing issues involved.

18014,Ian Botham's Sporting Challenge,1987,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,,Sports Trivia ,Roll / Spin and Move,"IAN BOTHAM'S SPORTING CHALLENGE is a sports trivia game carrying the name of a former England Cricketer.

Play is conducted on a hexagonal board with each side representing the home venue of each of the players.  The venues represent six different UK sporting venues (Wembley, Lord's, Wimbeldon, Silverstone, St. Andrews and Newmarket) though the venues themselves have no direct significance to the game.

Starting at their home venue players roll the dice and move the appropriate number of spaces in the clockwise direction marked on the board.

On each colored space landed on a question is answered corresponding to the color of that space:
Purple = Grounds and Venues (GV)
Red = Clubs, Competitions and trophies (CCT)
Yellow = Personalities (P)
Blue = Records, Facts and Feats (RFF)
Mauve = Mixed Bag (MB)

A correctly answered question allows the player to throw and move again - if not, the turn ends and play passes to the next player.

If the coloured space also depicts a trophy then a correctly answered question will earn part of a two part trophy (first time round the trophy itself and then the lid).  The various bits of the trophy are placed in that player's home venue on the appropriately coloured square.  The aim is to amass one trophy and lid for each of the five categories of questions.

Alternatively a playing piece may land on a space marked with a C meaning it is a Challenge position - there are two types of these:
On a white C a player may challenge for one of the unlidded trophies in that particular home venue (i.e. a trophy already won by another player).  If choosing to challenge for a trophy a player may elect to answer a question himself (in order to steal the trophy) or challenge his opponent to do so (in order to retain the trophy).
On a striped C a player may challenge for a trophy base on either of the adjacent venues, or elect to answer a question in any category for which a trophy base or lid is required.

The winner is the first player who collects in his/her home venue, five complete trophies.

With Il Mischiastorie (the Storymixer), you can make many stories about the Little Hare. Look for the tile with the yellow star, where the little hare wakes up and sees the hunters coming, and put it in front of you. In the lower right corner there is a red circle. Look for all the tiles with a red circle in the lower left corner: there are two of them, one where the little hare goes back to his den and thinks about what to do, another in which he leaves the wood and goes to the city. Choose one and put it besides the first tile: for example, choose the one in which the hare goes to town. Do you see a black circle in the lower right corner? Look for all the tiles with the black circle on the left, choose the one you like more and so on, until you reach the end of the story: a tile with a star on the right.
Now you can show your story to everyone you like: your mum, a cousin, a friend but showing it is not enough: you have to tell them your story. For example, why the hare goes to the city? Is he just scared of the hunters? Is he bored of his life in the wood? Is he curious about the city?
When you are finished, you can start again with a new story, choosing different tiles: there are so many possibilities! And when you are expert, you can decide to put together tiles without caring of the symbols, or even draw new tiles using the blank ones you found in the box.

They also try to catch the Hood himself.

Every time a Thunderbird lands on a square containing an alarm marker a 'rescue' is made  the marker is removed from the board.

If a Thunderbird lands on the same square as The Hood, a 'photograph' is collected as evidence of the encounter.

More than one Thunderbird may be required to effect a particular rescue.  Thunderbird 4 is restricted to squares on the board containing water and cannot pass over land areas.

There are eight photographs and nine alarm markers.  The object of the game is for the Thunderbirds to collect all eight photographs of The Hood before all nine alarm markers are present on the board.

The players try to place or turn the chips in a way that completes their symbols. Two quarters of the same symbol placed side by side are called a pair. Quarters which touch only at the corner, i.e. which are placed diagonally are by definition not a pair. For each pair completed, the player gains one point. That means a half of a symbol is worth one point, three-quarters two points and a complete symbol gives four points. The player who has collected more points at the end of the game is the winner.

The game is played in two phases - a betting phase and a race phase, with different parts of the board being used for these two phases.

Placing Your Bets:
Players place their dogs at the start of betting board.  Players take turns to throw a D6, moving their pieces and following the instructions on the board.  These will generally involve taking cards (which are used later in the game) or placing a bet.  Betting involves placing a marker on the Betting card to indicate, for example, that the yellow player thinks the red dog will come 4th.

Play continues like this until a player's piece passes the Go to the Traps space, at which point he/she completes their bets by filling up their betting column, and move their dog to a free trap to await the start of the race.  Once in the traps the player must way until all the other traps are filled.

The Race:
The race phase comprises two actions:
- Playing a card (if you have one) and following the instructions on it.
-  Roll three dice and, using the score on each of the dice to move one of the seven playing pieces forward - three of the pieces (two dogs and the hare, or three dogs) move each turn.

A roll of 10 (on the three dice) allows a player to position a lampost in the path of one of the dogs which prevents the dog from moving until the lampost is moved.

The hare is moved in the same way as the dogs but is normally  in the lead.  If one of the dogs overtakes the hare it is deemed to have eaten it, and is lamposted.  At this point the hare is dead and takes no further part in the game, but is deemed (on account of the fact that it is in the dog's stomach) to finish immediately after the dog for betting purposes.

Once a dog crosses the finish line it is placed on the betting card in the position corresponding to where it actually finished the race.  The player owning the dog keeps playing however so as to influence where the other dogs finish.

Once all the dogs are finished, the actual result is compared against the predictions with players scoring as follows:
- 15 points - correct prediction of the winner.
- 10 points - correct prediction of any other position.
- 5 points - almost correct (one place out) prediction of any postition.

Scores are totalled and the player with the highest score wins.

You and your opponent each pick a card (based solely on your like of the art work) and then a corner of the card. Place the two corners together so you can see the numbers through the holes.

Now both players call either High, Low, or Both. If one player says High and the other player says Low, play again. Otherwise, either the highest or the lowest number wins, depending on what was called. If either of you says Both the game is always on, but you must win both highest and lowest numbers to claim victory.

Read out the highest/lowest numbers you can see through your holes and try to beat your opponent, that's it!

This particular set was released at summer conventions because James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (a re-working of the classic and trademark-infringing Before I Kill You Mr Bond) wasn't quite ready yet. You can buy the whole set of 9 cards for just $2.50

The game consists of a plastic pirate ship on a tilted rotating base, a spinner, four shipmates (the player pieces), and a heavyweight Ghost Pirate. The ship contains a quantity of beads which shift around like an unstable cargo, and there are various pivoted fittings (mast, plank etc). There is also a loose rolling barrel on the deck which trips various traps as it rolls around.

Essentially a roll and move game, the shipmates start the game in a 'raft' and move onto the first of the 17 numbered spaces on the ship. Some spaces are more precarious than others, especially the mast and pivoted traps. Half of the numbers printed on the spinner have a 'ghost' symbol which enables the player to also move the Ghost Pirate onto any of the marked larger spaces, thus causing the entire ship to rotate and pitching any unlucky players back into the sea, where they have to start over (unless they've got past space 9, whereas they can return to space 9 instead).

The winner is the first person to get to space 17 (the treasure) by spinning the exact number to get there.

The game also comes with stylus with different ends to use as a placement and removal tool, a rulebook and Finally, you get an easel and a picture hanger to display your masterpiece after you have finished playing the game.

The game basis itself on the saying of Is Magnetic Dimensions a game or is it art?  The answer in the manual to both of these questions is an unequivocal yes.  Although in the rule book there are lots of options on how to play the game, it leaves it as an open form.  You basically first take a piece and place it on the game board, and subsequently add another piece, then another and so on, until you have created your own design, or one of the shapes/designs shown in the Game manual.  A Magnetic dimensions game takes as long as you need to create your picture through the use of all or some of the pieces.

Primarily the game is designed for one player, however there are several options/ideas for a 2 player game.  For a two player version of the game you can allocate a certain number of pieces to each player, and then give a time limit on building something using opposite sides of the gaming board.  Or you can have one design built, and then the other player tries to build it in the same amount of time or less.

The game has limitless options, and is a fun and relaxing game, as you create and challenge yourself within the game.  You will see that there are many unique and very complicated ways you can create.  This game has thousands of options that make players get deeply involved consumed by it.

In the end you will have to ask yourself... Is it a game or is it Art?  In the end it really is both!

Players are prospectors searching for old in the Old West.  They are based in a mining town, from where they venture out into the surrounding wild territory.  When a player strikes it lucky, he stakes his claim and rushes back to the town to register it.  A registered claim becomes a Mine and its owner collects gold nuggets every time he lands on it.  He will try and carry his nuggets back to the Bank and on the way the other players challenge him and may rob him of his gold.  The first player to get five nuggets to the Bank is the winner.

From the box:

Goldrush is a game for 2, 3 or 4 players and takes about one hour to play.  The rules are simple to follow and luck and skill are well blended to make it enjoyable for each member of the family or children of different ages on their own.

When you play Goldrush the fun starts from the from the first move.  You re-live a time of high adventure when reckless men staked all they had on one lucky strike.  Every game is different because you seldom strike gold in the same place twice.

You will need to be clever as well as lucky to make your fortune but right to the final exciting showdown, every player has a chance to win.

In the Shadow of Byzantium puts you at the head of a principality struggling to survive and overpower your neighbors. Judicious use of slender finances to create armies, alliances and acts treachery is essential to victory. Bind other princes to you with marriage alliances to gain a breathing space to perhaps build fortifications to protect your land. Who dares truly wins in this game of big chances and big payoffs, but the winner of today could easily be the loser tomorrow.....

The game can go up to twenty turns, but thanks to our variable game termination rules, the last turn could be anytime between turns 12 and 20, thus making it virtually impossible for the gang up on the leader syndrome to ruin everyones fun. One player is rarely so far ahead that they become the target of other players anyway.

The players to choose from:
The Empire of Constantinople
The Nicean Empire
The Duchy of Athens
The Principality of Achaea
The Despotate of Epiros
The Kingdom of Thessalonika
The Venetians of Crete (Lords of the Archipelago)

In the Shadow of Byzantium can be played with up to seven players. A four player game takes about 2 hours to play. There is very little set up and almost no record keeping (just treasury- big deal!). We had so much fun playing this game first time out we believe it is destined to be one of our most popular products ever.

18086,Alphatian Roulette,2004,6.93333,6,1.5,2,2,15,15,,Dice Fighting ,Dice Rolling,"Aim of the game is to massacre your opponent inflicting him ten (dice) damages!

Players swap each turn between attacker and defender.
During his turn the first player is attacking; his opponent is defending. The attack is done as follows: the player rolls the five d6, after which he can re-roll the dice he wants (however, each time he must keep at least one die, so that the attack will be composed at most of five rolls).

The goal is to try to damage the opponent, with each 6 being a possible damage.

When the attacker has completed his throws, the defender must try to parry: he chooses one of the numbers shown by the dice and throws all the dice that show that number. But beware!: with a single roll now he has to obtain at least one die with a higher number, and he has only one possibility.

If he fails, he suffers one damage for each 6 that the attacker has rolled, plus an additional damage. If he succeeds, instead, the attacker suffers as many damages as the difference between the thrown number and the lower among the attack dice.

The Roulette is very simple and each game lasts from two to three minutes. Even though, attacker and defender have often strategy doubts.

Also a more-than-two player version exists.

Each player starts with 5,000 DM and tries to buy as many products as possible with this.

To do this you move your pawn around the board which depicts the 20 products, of which only 5 are available at any time, connected by branching paths. If you reach one of the available products you may place one of your wooden markers, of which you have 4, on the product card. These cards show a price track for each player that allows them to reduce the price in five steps. At the end of your turn you may advance up to 2 of your markers one space on their price track. If you reach the end of the price track all players have to buy the product, even if they have no marker on that card. Each player pays the price that his marker indicates. The game ends as soon as one player is out of money. The player with the most money left wins. The game also includes random event cards and 'Stop' markers that may be used to block player movement.

Two players each have six cubes with the sides colored in three different colors (opposite sides matching). One color is vulnerable, a second color is blocking, and a third color is aggressive. Each player's six cubes are alike, but some pattern distinguishes one player's cubes from the other. On a three by six horizontal rectangular grid, each player's cubes start with vulnerable on top all along the nearest side and aggressive on the left and right sides of each cube. In turn, each player rolls or tips one of his/her cubes up to two spaces, possibly including an orthogonal turn in the middle. If a piece started the turn as aggressive it can capture by landing upon an opposing vulnerable or aggressive piece as any part of this move. No piece may move through a blocking piece. Adjacent captures are mandatory. The first player to capture or immobilize all six opposing pieces wins. A necessary house rule to avoid fortress defense stalemates is to only allow vulnerable pieces to move two spaces.

These four volumes (Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds) explore the foundations and current research in the field of combinatorial games (i.e. games for 2 players with alternating turns, no hidden information, and no chance).  It is the definitive work about such games.

In Volume 1, the authors do the spadework, presenting theories and techniques to dissect games of varied structures and formats in order to develop winning strategies.  Their focus is on adding games, including Nim, Hackenbush, and Kayles.  The inclusion of many examples helps the reader to put the mathematical analysis to immediate use.

In Volume 2, the authors have a Change of Heart and bend the rules of Volume 1 to apply them to games that may continue indefinitely or in which winning is not necessarily making the last move, such as Cut-cake and Loopy Hackenbush.

In Volume 3, the authors examine Games played in Clubs, giving case studies for coin and paper-and-pencil games, such as Dots and Boxes and Nimstring.

In Volume 4, the authors present a Diamond of a find, covering one-player games such as Solitaire and ponder subjects and questions such as, Purging Pegs Properly, Pursuing Puzzles Purposefully, and What is Life?

Step by step the diplomatic relations between Japan and the USA worsen. This first leads to diplomatic and economical pressure of the USA against Japan. Finally Japan opens the struggle for a Pacific Empire of the Rising Sun with its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. 
 Scenarios: 
  
September 1939 
Since July 1937 a war between Japan and China rages unlike in Europe a mere partisan and guerrilla war. Will the USSR interfere? Will Japan go for the Pacific, or wage a full scale war against China? Or will Japan help the Axis in wearing down the USSR? 
  
June 1941 
The Axis has assaulted the USSR in the ETO. Will Japan join in or stick to its non aggression pact with the USSR? Japan and the USSR have more time to prepare for the inevitable war against each other. Will Japan operate even better than historical? Or will the USA be able to repel the Japanese assaults? 
  
Pearl Harbor Dec 1941 
December 7 1941. The Japanese aircraft carrier elite is on its way for a surprise strike against the US Naval base Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Hawaii. Will the US Navy been crippled for months? 
At the same time Japan launches a series of Invasions against the Philippines, the Netherlands' East Indies and other important islands. 
With this infamous attack Japan wakes the industrial giant USA ... 
  
Each of the scenarios can be used as a starting point for a full PTO game till 1945. Pearl Harbor uses the same system as its predecessors Morse code..._, Triumph  Fall of the Desert Fox, and Cold Days in Hell.

18105,Atlantis,1980,7.225,20,4.2,2,6,120,120,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Territory Building ,Modular Board,"This game was invented at the Technical University Twente in The Netherlands.

Atlantis is very original in its mechanisms. The board is built up from segments, each consisting of 7 hexes: one in the middle and six around it. The board can be made quite large, but is usually something like 4x4 segments; the game takes longer as the board gets larger. Each player has pieces of a single color. Pieces can be stacked, but when the stack gets as high as, or higher than, the number of neighbouring hexes, it explodes, spreading one piece to each surrounding hex and destroying the original field. If all seven hexes of a segment have been destroyed, the segment is removed. Thus, during the course of a game the board (Atlantis) disappears into the waves.

The goal of the game is to conquer as many free hexes as possible. An area is conquered if it is only touched by hexes without enemy-pieces (compare Go). But beware: Exploding hexes have the nasty tendency to turn into an unstoppable front of explosion and destruction.

As far as I know this game has not been released commercially, but nevertheless it has a large playing community, since the University Game Club (Fanaat) has now more than one generation of offspring players. The game plays best with 2, 3 or 6 players, for symmetry reasons. 4 players is possible, but since the board is not mirror-symmetric the players will not have equivalent starting positions.

Play
The play is basic Dots and Boxes. The first player marks an box edge with a stick and if he completes any boxes he marks those as his, and he gets another move. If no box is formed, then play passes to the other player.

Variations on Basic Game of Dots and Boxes

         Some squares are marked so as count as double points
         The plastic board has some of the box edges permanently marked. (Presumably this is to prevent any mirroring strategy.)

18108,Wild Bill Hickok's the Cavalry and the Indians Game,1955,0,0,0,2,2,15,15,,American Indian Wars American West ,Point to Point Movement,"One person plays the Indians and the other the Cavalry.  The gameboard has a fort which houses the 12 cavalry markers while on the opposite side of the board an Indian village houses the 12 Indians.  A one-way path winds around the board, with the Indians moving in one direction, while the cavalry move in the opposite, which means they'll come head to head in a short while.

The Indians player leads off, spinning the spinner, which has values of 0 to 10; the player moves his first marker accordingly.  The cavalry player follows in suit.  On the next Indian spin, the player moves the Indian marker already in play and adds a new one from the village, each moving the distance the spinner indicates. Play continues on with each player soon moving several of his markers on each turn.

Each marker counts for 10 men, and there are several spaces scattered across the board which, when landed upon, indicate you must lose 10 men.  Essentially, that marker is removed from the game, not to return.  Also, when a player lands on an opponent's marker, he captures that piece and moves into his fort or village.  Additionally, a few spaces allow a player to raid his opponent's fort or village and re-capture his captured markers.

Eventually, through such attrition, one player will find he has no markers left out on the trail.  At that point, if he is holding some of his opponent's markers captive, he may trade his captives for his own markers, place them in his respective fort or village, and move them into play as normal.  If, however, a player has no markers on the trail, and no captives in his fort or village, he loses the game, giving his opponent the victory.  Thus, the markers have no end destination and may move round and round the board, victory coming only when the opponent has lost all of his markers.

Summit is a positional card game based very loosely on mountain climbing. The object of the game is to lead your expedition safely to the top of the mountain (21,000 feet). Equipping your party, establishing base camps, waiting out the weather, and making the final assault are among the important elements of gameplay. Through planning and the proper use of your cards (and a bit of luck) you may reach the summit!

The game includes a map of the mountain and eight pages of rules. A token or marker, one six-sided die, and a standard 52-card deck are needed for play.

The deck of movie cards is shuffled and one card is turned face up. Players roll the die and move their pawn on the board. This is divided into several squares, each with a picture from a movie based on a book by Astrid Lindgren. If your pawn lands on a square containing the same picture as the one on the card, then you get that card. The next card is turned face up, and so on. Players may either just move according to the die, or they may try to land on one of the squares with a question mark. If they do, one of the other players picks up the top quiz card and reads the question with the same number as the number on the die. So, if you roll a five and land on a question mark, you will have to answer question number five. The questions are all about movies based on the books of Astrid Lindgren. One side of the die is marked with an arrow, and if you roll the arrow you just pick up the current card.

Each card equals one victory point, and three cards of the same movie will earn you bonus points. The player with the most points when all cards are taken is the winner.

18142,A Shepherd and his Dog,1983,4.54545,11,1,2,2,15,15,,Abstract Strategy Animals Children's Game Farming ,Point to Point Movement,"A SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG is a two player game, one of whom plays the part of the Shepherd and his Dog and who tries to secure all five sheep behind the fence in the field. The other player is the sheep, any of which has to escape from the field through either of the two gates.

The Shepherd player starts by moving either of his two pieces from their starting point (at the two gates) to any adjacent space (hexagon). The Sheep player then moves any one of his sheep to an adjacent hexagon, but not one that is also adjacent to either the shepherd or his dog.

Play alternates between the two with the Shepherd player moving either his shepherd or dog and the Sheep player one of his sheep. If the dog or shepherd is moved into a space next to a sheep then that sheep has to move on its next turn - no sheep may occupy a hexagon next to either the shepherd or his dog, unless it is unable to move.

The Shepherd and his Dog win the game if they succeed in herding all five sheep into the penned off area, behind the fence, and the fence is closed. The Sheep win the game when any one sheep leaves the field by either of the two hexagons marked with a gate. In the event of a stale-mate the sheep win.

18143,Rare Species,1985,5,4,0,2,4,0,0,,Animals Environmental Memory ,MemoryRoll / Spin and MoveSet Collection,"RARE SPECIES is a 2-4 player memory game endorsed by UK botanist/conservationist David Bellamy.

The game contains a playing board, four conservation park boards, four playing pieces and 24 rare species playing cards.  These cards illustrate breeding pairs of 12 of the world's most endangered and rare species of wildlife.  The females have cards with pink backs and the males have blue backs.

The 12 female cards are placed face down on 12 yellow squares in the middle of the board.  The 12 male cards are placed face up on the 12 green squares that surround the female cards.  The playing pieces are placed on the circular brown track, next to one of the corners of the board.

Players take it in  turns to roll the dice and move their playing piece in a clockwise direction around the board.  Once moved the playing piece will be next to one of the male animal cards.  The player attempts to make a pair by turning over one of the female cards and showing it to the other players:
-  If it is a match then the piece is removed and placed face down in one of the three bamboo cages at the entrance to that player's conservation park.  The male is left in place on the board.  Each cage can only hold one female so therefore a player can only collect a maximum of three females without them forming part of a breeding pair.
-  If it is not a match then the card is returned to its original face down position.

When a conservationist lands next to the male of any species they may make their play as for the opening rounds if they have no females in their bamboo cages.  If, however they have a female or females caged at the entrance to their conservation park, and they think that one of them is the mate of the male that they have just landed next to, they may attempt to turn that female face up:
-  If they are correct they remove the male from the playing board and place it with the female face down in the conservation park (not back in the cage).  This breeding pair takes no further part in the game
-  If they choose the wrong female then it is simply turned face down again on the conservation park board.

Unscrupulous conservationists may also steal breeding females from other player's conservation parks.  When a player lands alongside a male and they think that one of the other players has its mate in one of their cages then they can attempt to steal it by turning it over:
-  If they are correct then the piece is stolen and moved to one of their own cages.
-  If they are wrong, it is returned face down where it came from, and if the erring player has any females in his own cages then one of them is released back to one of the free yellow squares in the middle of the board.

No more than one conservationist can occupy the same space on the outside track, and spaces that are not next to males (i.e. the male has already been claimed) are not counted for movement purposes.

At the end of the game, when all the females have been paired, the player with the greatest number of breeding pairs in their conservation park is the winner.

18148,Spies,1988,4.5,2,2,2,6,15,15,,Maze ,Paper-and-PencilPoint to Point Movement,"SPIES - The Sneaky Spy Game is a maze solving game.  It contains pads, pencils, card stands, 47 numbered cards, 10 spyglass cards, and 24 Spy Route Cards.

Each player takes a Spy Route Card and places it in a card stand so that he can see it, but no-one else can.  On each card is the route of a spy, starting from one of six embassies, passing through the Secret Service building, and progressing to a point where the Spy is caught.  Each route is 12 points long, passing through 12 of the 47 numbered points on the card.

The aim of the game is to determine the route of the spy on the card to your left.  Every turn you may ask the player on your left about one location on the Route Card.  This is done by the use of the number cards by:
-  Taking the top card from the number deck and playing one card from what is then a hand of 5 (4 cards remain in the hand).
-  Calling out the top card from the discard pile.
-  Using a Spyglass card to ask about any location on the route.

When a number is called the player to the left checks the route and provides one of the following responses:
-  If the number is on the spy's route then the sighting is Confirmed.
-  If the number is adjacent to and in visual contact with the spy's route then the sighting is Witnessed.
-  If it is neither of the above then there is No Sighting.

Information gained is marked accordingly on a Detector Pad.

At any time during a player's turn a player may try to guess the spy's route.  To do this he must call out the 12 numbers of a continuous route, in sequence, starting from the embassy to the spy's point of capture.  The first player to do this correctly is the winner.

Each player has 16 pieces which are placed in the outer ring of the circular board in four blocks of four. Red starts.

Players move alternately on black or gold squares, one piece at a time, one square at a time, in any direction.

Entry into the inner circles may on be gained through the bridges provided. When a player gets one of his pieces to the center that piece is removed and can be placed on any vacant square on the outside edge of the board where it can be brought back into play again, providing that it is that player's turn. The first player to get four of his/her pieces into the center of the board is the winner.

Players may also win by a wipe out. This is when a player has captured the majority of an opponent's pieces so that the opponent cannot realistically attain the winning score of four.

A player may move diagonally across all bridges except the two bridges at the center, where the player has to move directly on to the bridge.

Pieces may be captured by jumping in any direction - forwards , backwards, sideways or diagonally. A player can capture several opposing pieces by including changes of direction in his move.

Pieces may only be jumped once during any sequence of moves, captured pieces then leave the board on completion of the move. Jumping is optional - it is at a player's discretion whether to execute all possible jumps.

If a situation arises where a player cannot move, then his opponent can move as many times as he likes until either he wins or an opening is made for the stationary player.

The first player to get four of his/her pieces into the center of the board is the winner.

Players take it in turns to be the caller.  The caller takes a card and rolls the dice to see which word is going to be played (the words are numbered from 1 to 6).  The caller then announces the number of letters in the word and a letter from the middle of the word (i.e. not the first or last letter of the word).  The other players mark this information down on their score pad.

Going clockwise round the table players may ask for a letter to be added to either the immediate right or the immediate left of the starting letter (or chain of letters as the word develops).  The word therefore grows outwards from the original starting letter.

At any time from the giving of the first letter any player may try to guess the word by calling it out aloud.  If the guess is correct then the player scores 1 point for every letter as yet unexposed.  If incorrect the player loses 1 point from his score.

The first player to score 20 points or more is the winner.

18210,60 Minutes to Save the Earth,1991,5.33333,3,0,2,6,60,60,,Environmental Trivia ,Area MovementRoll / Spin and Move,"60 MINUTES TO SAVE THE EARTH is a boardgame that pits industry against the environment against the clock.

The board comprises a stylized world with 25 double-sided environmental jigsaw pieces which allow you to change the earth for good or bad as you travel across the globe.

The game requires players to make money by successfully running major industries (nuclear, oil, timber etc.) whilst also being environmentally aware. The winner is the player who can strike a balance between greed and conscience during the 100 years (60 minute) duration of the game.

Commodity cards are distributed evenly between the players - these indicate the jigsaw pieces on which this particular activity can take place and environmental (green) or industrial (gray) means by which the commodity can be exploited. Environmentally sound exploitation allows the jigsaw pieces to be placed green side up, and green tokens to be earned. Industrial exploitation requires the jigsaw piece to be gray side up, but generates income. Pieces can change from green to gray and vice versa dependent on how they are used.

Play involves taking a Fate Card, and following the instructions on it, rolling the die and moving. If the place moved to is on one of their commodity cards then it is ticked off - if not a question must be answered.

When 60 minutes (100 years) have passed, play ceases and the green jigsaw pieces are counted. If the required number of pieces (this is a group task and depends on the number of players) have not been turned to green, the Earth is lost and there is no winner ... If the required number have been achieved, the player that has accumulated 10 green tokens, 300 million and visited all the destinations listed on their commodity cards wins. In the event that this is not achieved, the winner is the player with the most Green Tokens, money and destinations visited, in that order.

18222,Definition,1981,9.5,1,0,3,5,60,60,,Humor Movies / TV / Radio theme Word Game ,Partnerships,"Based on the long-running (1974-89) Canadian game show, the object is to have the most cash and prizes by solving word puzzles after a predetermined number of rounds.

The game master places spells out the phase by putting letters face-down on the gameboard. A cryptic clue for the phrase is then read to the players. (Sample from the box lid  Clue: Why did the tailor quit his job? Solution: Because it was habit forming.)

Each player or team, in turn, will choose two letters. The first letter chosen will give the opposing team a chance to guess if it appears anywhere in the solution, while the second will benefit the team who guessed it.

The team that solves the puzzle gets a prize card and plays the bonus game. In the bonus game, the letters are revealed by the game master in alphabetical order, and if the team gives the correct answer they win $10 for each unrevealed letter.

Most of the parts were recycled from Milton Bradley's 1975 adaptations of Wheel of Fortune. Interestingly, the box cover predates the December 16, 1985 change to all-civilians.

The game comes with about 100 puzzles, all previously used on the show.

18226,Dawning Empire,1983,5,1,0,1,6,240,240,Wargames,Fantasy Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Dawning Empire is a multi-player fantasy wargame.  The map shows an imaginary continent with the usual terrain features.  Unusually, players choose their home kingdoms secretly using small replicas of the map - there are rules for players who overlap contesting the disputed area.  Cities of the (presumably dying) Old Empire are placed randomly on the map.

After initial placement the mechanics are mostly standard, with a certain amount of chrome.  Every player chooses a race, which affects how well they fight in different types of terrain.  Players can annex land by decree in addition to conquering it.  Old Empire units can appear and attack the players, but their cities conceal treasures (and a dragon, and a plague).  There is a deck of event cards to inject a bit of chaos (in addition to combat and encounter dice rolls).

The object of the game is to either eliminate all other players or obtain the most victory points within a time limit.

18227,Cyrus et Pyxis,1999,6.66667,3,0,2,2,90,90,Abstract Wargames,Abstract Strategy Ancient Wargame ,,"Cyrus et Pyxis is a highly abstract wargame, or an abstract strategy game with a war theme, depending on your point of view.  The two sides are Persians and Greeks, although Pyxis is not the name of an actual Greek leader (it's a small pottery box).

Each side has identical armies of 20 units - 10 infantry, 2 each of archers, cavalry, elephants, and phalanxes, a royal guard, and a king.  These are deployed on a 12x12 board, along with terrain tiles representing forests and hills (so the board will be different each time).

On a turn a player can move 5 infantry units and 1 each of the other types.  Units that move into enemy units cause combat to occur.  Combat is strictly deterministic - the strength differential determines whether the attacker or defender retreats or is eliminated.  Units have different strengths which further vary by terrain, phalanxes do better against mounted units, and archers can support other units.

The object of the game is to kill the enemy king or move your king off the enemy side of the board.

A neat aspect of this game is a semi-collectible element whereby for a modest sum you can buy teams in each of the team strips of the major pro-cycling teams. Whilst not as satisfying a game as, say, Um Reifenbreite, it does make for a good visual recreation of the peloton in action.

18280,Wheeler Dealer,2005,3,1,0,2,6,90,90,,Negotiation ,Auction/BiddingCommodity SpeculationDice RollingSet CollectionTrading,"Contents of the Game:

1 playing board, 3 dice, 3 packs of Commodity cards (coloured red green and yellow) 1 pack of Command cards (coloured blue) various denominations of Credit notes, 6 playing pieces, 6 At Risk Zone Cards, 1 set of Rules.

Cards: There are 4 packs of cards which are placed on the playing board, as indicated by the 4 colour coded cards situated between the inner and outer circles.  The 4 packs of cards are made up as follows:-

Red Commodity Cards  cheapest range from 500 to 1,000 Credits.

Green Commodity Cards  middle range from 2,000 to 10,000 Credits.

Yellow Commodity Cards  dearest range from 10,000 to 100,000 Credits.

Blue Cards  Command cards  instructions must be followed.

This game can be played by 2 to 6 players aged 8 and over. There are 3 different levels of the game, each being a little more complex than the last. The first level enables you to get used to the basic idea. The second level introduces more advanced rules and techniques.  The third level encourages you to play the game in its purest form, pitting your wits against the other players until a final winner emerges. (You will find a Quick Start Guide on the back of the At Risk Zone Card.)

The idea of the game is to be the most successful Wheeler Dealer and depending on which level is played, be the first to have a total wealth of up to 3,000,000 credits. Players start with 8,250 credits and a random hand of 4 red and 4 green Commodity cards on level 1.  Players accumulate wealth by selectively buying and selling Commodity cards one at a time, until a set of 3 or more identical cards has been built.  Once a set has been built it may be sold to the bank for 2, 3 or 4 (sometimes more) times the face value.  It is good practice to place the set to be sold to the bank in the middle of the playing board.  Commodity cards sold to the bank are placed at the bottom of the coloured coded deck.

Players must start on the outer circle, from any of the blue spaces, in a clockwise direction. Players may only progress to the inner circle when they have sufficient total wealth (150,000 Credits level 1).  As soon as one player reaches the inner circle all other players are permitted to enter also, even if they do not have sufficient wealth.  Wealth is accumulated faster on the inner circle, however, there are greater risks.  All players must announce that they are going to enter the inner circle before the dice are thrown. Before throwing the dice to move around either circle, players may buy one Commodity card from any other player for 3 times the face value. Other players do not have to sell and only one card may be bought at a time.  If buying a card makes a set of 3 or more the player may also sell the set to the bank before throwing the dice to move around the circle.

Players may at any time during their turn secure loans on other Commodity cards in their possession at  face value which is known as the At Risk Value. Such cards must be placed on the At Risk Zone Card, unless they form part of the set to be sold immediately to the bank.  At Risk cards may be bought by other players, when it is their turn, at 2 times face value.  If asked, the owner of an At Risk card must sell it to the other player, repay the bank the At Risk Value, plus 10% interest. It is good practice to place the At Risk Zone Card to your left, thereby keeping your cards and money away from the other players.

Once the above options have been exhausted, the player then rolls the dice (2 outer circle 1 inner circle) and moves his playing piece the number of spaces rolled in a clockwise direction.  The player turns over the top card of the colour landed on and may buy the Commodity card at face value.  If buying this card makes a set, you must wait until your next turn before selling the set to the bank.  If a player does not have or cannot raise enough money to buy the Commodity card or does not want it, the player must pay the bank 10% of the face value to cover the Handlers Charge and the Commodity card is placed to the bottom of the colour coded deck. If the player cannot raise enough money to pay the Handlers Charge bankruptcy must be declared.  When landing on a yellow space (outer circle), players have the option of turning over a yellow Commodity card buying it or paying the Handlers Charge, or turning over a blue Command card and following the Commands.

If a player lands on a blue space outer circle a 5,000 Credit bonus is paid to the player from the bank. The player also takes a blue card (Command card) from the top of the deck and follows the Commands exactly. If a player lands on a blue space on the inner circle no bonus is paid but a Command card must be taken from the top of the blue deck and Commands followed exactly.

The game begins with a stack of 5 pieces on the center intersection, and each player has four home intersections.  The first player to pull at least 5 pieces onto any combination of his or her home intersections is the winner.

Both players simultaneously reveal their moves, which consist of pulling the end of a particular string toward the edge of the board.

Between turns, stacks of pieces rest on the string intersections.  These stacks are moved, split and/or combined when the ends of the strings connected to those intersections are pulled.  Stacks stop when they reach the edge of the grid.

Stacks pulled in two different directions are split into two equal stacks, with extra pieces added as necessary when odd stacks are split.  If the same string end is pulled by both players, the stacks on that string move, but the extra stress causes the string to break.  After such a move, that string cannot be pulled for the duration of the game.

Bonus: Includes letters in American Sign Language on the back side.

Carolina Rebels is BSOs follow-up to their popular Civil War Tactical System game, Louisiana Tigers, this time a company-level American Revolution gaming at a scale of 40 yards per hex and about 50 men per counter/unit.

Carolina Rebels emphasizes the limits of command, training, and discipline, all in the milieu of the very linear style of warfare in the pre-Napoleonic era. The system allows players to choose their method of approach and their style of combat. Will they go into close order, or spread our for better fire possibilities. What are the pros and cons of the rifle-armed American militia? Can your dragoon forces exert any influence?

Carolina Rebels contains a high amount of tactical detail, all in a very short group of rules, designed for quick learning and fast, easy play.

The two battles chosen highlight small tactics towards the end of the war, where both sides had ample opportunities to watch, learn and practice, with an emphasis on Formation. Some of the great commanders of the war, from Nathanial Greene to Daniel Morgan to the infamous, but capable, Banastre Tarleton are in full action at the surprisingly even battles at both Cowpens and Hobkirks Hill.

Carolina Rebels is designed for quick learning and easy play, using a system that has almost unlimited possibilities. Game rules are short, but there are lots of charts and tables to cover every aspect of battle at this micro level. The combat rules, covering both ranged fire as well as bayonet shock, will seem familiar, yet different. Playing time is less than 2 hours.

Each game of Carolina Rebels includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemicks, colorful cut-and-paste counters, and 2 spiffy Bill Ramsay maps (in 4 sections).

Carolina Rebels was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.

Players must collect the pieces to build a machine, while disposing of any bombs they happen upon.  Once the machine is built, it fires one shot at a time at the monster until someone hits it.  Overall, a reasonable attempt to convert the arcade game into a boardgame, but other than for some memory elements and the disc flicking, there's not a lot of skill to the game.

Double Trouble, for four players, had a ludo-like format with each player having only one playing piece, but traveling around the board to try to gain four 'health habit' counters (eat right, exercise regularly, don't smoke, control stress) before racing for home. The twist to the game was that whenever any player rolled doubles, all players made a grab for one of the little bean bags (of which there was always one less than the number of players) on the board. The player who did not manage to grab a bean bag was sent back to his/her start.

The Calendar Game was a conventional 'go-round-the-board' dice-roll-and-move game where players tried to gain 'health points' by picking up 'health cards'. Up to six players could play.

The board is dark blue and the course is marked on in darker lines with dots to show where the yachts may move. There are also currents and shallows to be navigated.

The players in the game each get an answer card which is set up like a Keno card. Each of these cards have 5 headings (same on all cards): Artists/Authors, Headliners, Military Men, Statesmen, and Famous Women. When a quiz card is drawn and the question asked, a player having the correct answer on his/her card marks the spot with a mini poker chip. The first player to get a straight row of chips (vertical, horizontal, or diagonally) wins the game. The Questioner reviews the answers to make sure all answers were correct. Cards can be exchanged between players before a new game begins.

There are 75 Cards with 2 questions (AB) on each card. The backside of the card contains one answer which is correct for both AB questions. This yields a total of 150 different questions. The 12 Keno/Answer cards are different from each other.

Simple, straight-forward game mechanics, but the game rules state that modifications to game can be made by player consensus.

A die-roll determines whether a player may move their gladiators (1-4) or the lion (5-6).

Each gladiator has a weapon (net, trident or knife) and this weapon determines whether that gladiator can capture another gladiator (net captures trident, trident captures knife and knife captures net). The lion captures any gladiator it land on. Captured gladiators must start at that players table-end. The first player to move all his or her gladiators from the opposite table-end wins.

The game mechanic is compatible with the games in the Cry Havoc series. Each counter represents one person with some of the Krobs taking more than one hex.

The aim of the game is for the players, who act as the Tugs, to collect a waiting ship from the busy harbour and then tow it via a safe course, through the water hazards, to the ships' mooring position in the Bigg City Port.

The movement of the tugs in the harbour is dictated by a dice roll which permits players to move their tugs forwards or sideways the corresponding number of points (tugs cannot move backwards). If the player finishes on a  water hazard spot then a hazard card is taken and then penalty shown on the card carried out.

Players maneuver their tugs until they are in the space immediately in front of the ship that they have been directed to tow (this is decided by a secret card deal at the start of the game). At this point they are considered to have connected a tow-line to their charge.  They then tow the ship back across the board to that ship's designated mooring point, dealing with any hazards encountered on the way.

Once they have moored the ships in the appropriate berth, the tugs then have to return to their own mooring point.  The winner is the first player to have successfully towed his designated ship to the correct mooring point and then returned his/her tug to its mooring position.

18326,Napenaltowaktsche,1991,7,1,0,2,2,60,60,Wargames,American Indian Wars Miniatures Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemChit-Pull SystemDice Rolling,"From the Introduction: Napenaltowaksche is the skirmish level portion of the Flintlocks and Tomahawks system.  The setting is mid 18th-century New England, New France and the Old Northwest.  Where a choice had to be made between playability and realism, the choice was made toward ease of play so that the result is closer to a caricature rather than a historical simulation.

The game name is spelled both Napenaltowaktsche and Napenaltowaksche by the designer throughout the booklet.  It's Lenni Lenape (Delaware Indian) for They will be scalping each other, and I don't think the Lenni Lenape much care how you spell it so long as you pronounce it correctly.

It's a skirmish level miniatures wargame, where one figure represents one person.  The game was sold either simply as the rules alone (with basic character cards and player aids to photocopy), or as a full kit with felt and wood terrain, eight painted miniatures (4 Indians, 4 colonists), chits, character cards, player aid cards, movement stick, etc.

The mechanics contain a fair bit of randomness.  A chit for each figure in the game is put into a cup along with three end of turn chits - draw a chit to see who moves next.  The player owning the active figure rolls a d6 and adds its current Competence (which starts at 6 and drops as you take wounds) to get a number of action points available for a turn.  Moving one cm takes 1 AP, while loading your flintlock takes 12 AP, tracked on your character card in groups of 4 AP.

If a figure is fired at and the shot comes reasonably close, they must make a reaction check to see what they do.  This can range from running away to holding your ground to firing wildly to charging into melee - the more wounded you become, the more likely you are to run away.

Rules are given for aiming and firing, melee, line of sight through the dense woodland, other terrain, etc.  This is overall a lighter set of rules rather than a true simulation.

-  votes added or subtracted by the instructions of some of the Policy Cards.

Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6.  When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes.  If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.

Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same color series.  Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.

Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.

The New Share Quotations square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies.  This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own.  It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.

The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:
-    After a set time.
-    When the first player becomes bankrupt.
-    When all but one player has gone bankrupt.

At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate.  The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.

The tactical game uses three-dimensional Newtonian mechanics - every turn, each ship gets an acceleration on each axis which is added to the previous velocity. There are acceleration and maneuvering limits. Fighters are given the ability to alter facing somewhat independently of velocity, which affects combat - there is a section of invented maneuver combinations such as the Cauchy Spiral.

The campaign game requires a moderator, who creates a map and adjudicates the moves. There are rules for production, planetary invasion, and fairly complex rules for ship design if players do not like the 20 or so provided.

According to the rules, the game was originally a set of guidelines for a computer simulation, which is apparent from the amount of arithmetic involved. In addition to the rulebook, counters, base ships (which must be cut out) and fighter sighting templates (ditto), the game includes a sheet which allowed one to order programs for Texas Instruments calculators which would implement various game systems.

18351,West Bank Gamer's Game,2005,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Racing Transportation Travel ,Card DraftingHand ManagementPoint to Point MovementSet Collection,"Greg Schloesser, founder of the Westbank Gamers, has moved to the mountains of Tennessee.  Now, all of his friends in the Westbank Gamers are racing to be the first to visit him at his new home.  However, before they can visit, they must first race across the United States in search of chips, cookies and sodas.  This way, they won't arrive empty-handed!

This game was the brain-child of several members of the Westbank Gamers group.  It has mechanics that are similar to Ticket to Ride, but includes an abundance of event cards.  Plus, everything is custom-tailored to the Westbank Gamers, its members, and various experiences through the years.

Players must collect various sets of cards in order to complete routes between major U.S. cities.  The cards depict the faces of five Westbank Gamers stalwarts:  Lenny Leo, John Moore, Jim Fairchild, Michael Aucoin and Jerry Maus.  Each time a new city is reached, an event card is drawn.  The cards tell the story of infamous occurrences during the Westbank Gamers history, and cause a wide variety of events to occur.

Victory goes to the player who collects the needed cards, manages his hand properly, and survives the chaos of the events.

The production quality is outstanding, thanks to the talents of Jim Dr. Z Fairchild.

Sid Sackson's variation of this great abstract strategy game was originally published alongside the oldie LOA in the quarterly German Spielbox magazine (1982/3), and later re-published in the February/March 1989 issue of GAMES Magazine (the rules were later also printed in R. Wayne Schmittberger's New Rules for Classic Games book). Never commercially published, this game can be played with a checkerboard and twelve checkers of contrasting colors.

Each player's pieces are numbered 1-12, and the object is to capture five opposing pieces in numerical sequence. The number of spaces a piece moves is equal to the number of pieces adjacent to it.

18353,The Art of Wargaming,1990,6.875,8,0,0,0,0,0,Wargames,Book Wargame ,,"The idea of turning the violence of war into a game seems self-contradictory, yet despite this fundamental contradiction, or perhaps even because of it, games about war continue to grow in popularity. Until now, however, books on the subject have focused either on the recreational side of wargaming or on its military application. Here, Peter Perla presents the first genuine synthesis of both aspects, drawing on his own longtime experiences as a gaming hobbyist and a professional wargamer, in the U.S. defense community. Such a dual, inside perspective is unique among authors and enables him to offer a thorough evaluation of the two arenas, their similarities and differences and their influence on each other.

This book provides the most comprehensive and coherent discussion and analysis of wargaming ever written. Avoiding the sensationalism and superficiality of other works on the subject, it carefully explains the nature of the tool - the wargame - and the process of using it - wargaming. It argues for a better balance between professional realism and hobby playability and for increased cross-fertilization to educate and enlighten users.

Perla looks first at the history of wargaming in both its hobby and professional incarnations, and especially at its use by the Naval War College. He then draws on historical experience to define the fundamental principles of what wargaming is, and what it is not, and describes the subjects that wargaming is most useful for exploring. He also suggests how best to take advantage of its capabilities and downplay its limitiations. Finally, he examines current trends in wargaming in light of those historical perspectives and theoritical principles and projects into the future.

18354,The Way to Play,1975,8.57143,7,3.5,0,0,0,0,,Book ,,"From the dust jacket:

All over the world people play games: from primitive tribesmen to restless executives, and from birthday toddlers to aging millionaires. Wherever people gather, competition - and love of competition - appear.

Even the lone mind seeks the stimulus of games, and in a sense the opponent is still the same. It is always fickle Fate - or our own limitations! - that we are trying to defeat. Games rise and fall in popularity, appear and disappear. Inventiveness, and love of novelty, are always modifying the old and devising new. Games have lives, histories, and family trees. Few of us today have heard of the medieval mine men's morris; but millions of hours are spent on bridge, and chess, and Monopoly - and millions of dollars at poker or roulette. This book covers games that the reader will have seen or heard about - family games and social games, games played for fun, and games played for profit. But it includes, too, many that will be strange: games from foreign countries and ancient times. All are presented through a unique blend of text and illustration. Here the reader can learn not only the secrets of bridge or chemin de fer, but also how to play pachisi or nyout, lasca, or hex, or go. In addition to clearcut, concise rules, the players and equipment each game needs are listed, while the guide on pages 316-317 groups games together according to the number of participants they require. With a little thought, then, it is easy to arrange and even improvise to try an unfamiliar game - whether to make a party go, or to keep a houseful of children quiet! This book will tempt the reader to relax and experiment. It will let him soon settle those old rules disputes. It will be a friendly guide to those games that everyone else seems to know. We believe that it is unique - a unique aid to leisure. It is, in fact, the major reference book of how to play the games of the world.

18356,Knights and Knaves,1979,5,6,0,4,60,90,90,Wargames,Medieval Negotiation Territory Building Wargame ,Area Movement,"From the box  introduction:

Knights and Knaves is a game for four or more players. It simulates, in a general way, the intricate relationships of the lords and vassals of a large, loosely organized Empire located somewhere in Central Europe during the High Middle Ages (ca. 1200-1400). The players try to gain wealth, power and rank while building smaller, more cohesive kingdoms within the Empire for themselves. The game contains a complete and fairly simple set of basic rules and a considerable number of optional rules. These permit infinite variations. A game usually takes from one and a half to two hours.

Sequence of Play
  Soldiery Payment - players pay the rental for the mercenary companies they control; those he is unable to pay he must auction off; any unowned mercenary companies are auctioned
  Movement and Combat - You must have the permission of a realm's owner in order to move troops through it. Movement into a realm whose owner has refused you permission constitutes an attack on that realm.
  Taxation - players receive taxes from realms they hold; an optional rule allows for tax gouging and revolts
  Election - If either or both the offices of Emperor and Patriarch are vacant, an election is held for each vacant office. Any player who receives at least a third of the votes in an election gains the office; thus there might be as many as three Emperors or Patriarchs; if no player gets at least a third of the votes, the office remains empty.

The map shows only the Empire's political divisions - there is no terrain. It looks like an island, as nothing beyond the Imperial boundaries is shown. The Empire is made up of 68 realms, 60 of which are actually shown on the map (with such colorful names as The Aylemark, The League of Urf Durfal[Gerg Costikyan is listed among the play testers], the Kingdom of Hydanderabad, the Barony of Pfennig-Halfpfennig, the County of Pollenzo-Montenevoso...).  There are six extinct realms; if the player holding the title to an extinct realm gains control of all the realms that make it up, he may revive it, gaining its income, electoral votes and militia.  The two remaining realms are the Empire itself (held by the Emperor) and the Patrimony of Polykarp (held by the Patriarch, head of the Imperial Church). The Emperor can issue the Imperial Ban, and the Patriarch can excommunicate players. The game effect of both of these actions is to force the affected player to make a roll to see whether he can collect some, none or all of his revenues during each taxation period until the ban or excommunication is lifted.

Players perform game actions in order of the precedence of their highest title. The current Emperor goes first, followed by the Patriarch, then Kings and on down through the ranks to the Lord Mayors of free cities. When players' highest ranks are identical, then their second highest ranks are compared, and, if necessary, lesser ranks. Electors have precedence over non-electors, so an Elector-Duke would have precedence over a non-elector Duke.

The basic game has two types of troops: Militia Levies and Mercenary Companies.  Milita are not represented by counters on the map, and only fight in their home realms.  There are 20 mercenary companies, with names like O'Malleys Lancers, The Baratarian Archers, Gustodud's Free Companions, The Titanian Guards and Redmohr's Pikes. All but seven are venture companies; they have a home realm, and the current lord of that realm (who isn't necessarily the same person who employs them) may veto their use in combat. The rest are free companies, which may always be used in combat without restriction. There is also an optional rule for Regular Soldiery, which are recruited from realms under a player's control. Like mercenaries, these are represented by counters on the map and may move.

Combat is unusual in that troops are never eliminated. If a player's army is defeated, he must pay ransom for his troops; if unable to play, the opposing player captures and gains control of them. The loser may also be forced to retreat; if unable to retreat, he must pay double the ransom. If the player's noble is present, ransom is also doubled. If a noble is captured (due to being unable to pay ransom), the capturing player may do as he wishes to the prisoner, including allowing him to be ransomed, selling him to another player, or murdering him. A noble who dies is succeeded by his heir, who inherits all lands not held as fiefs from other players, all his troops and half his treasury.

Negotiation is encouraged. The players may negotiate anything and everything within the framework of the rules. Players may sell, lend or lease their troops, and may sell realms or grant them to other players as fiefs.

Victory is determined in three categories - Most Powerful(most troops), Most Noble(most titles), and Richest - so there can be as many as three winners

Some of the optional rules: single combat, mutinous mercenaries, assassination and conspiracy, plague, special events and even magic.

It is also recommended as being suitable for the background of a miniatures campaign in the medieval or Renaissance period.

18357,"Expos: Arts, Business, & Collections",1998,7.5,7,2,3,6,60,60,,Card Game Educational Memory ,Auction/BiddingMemorySet Collection,"An Art Game that you don't need to know anything about Art to play and enjoy. If you can tell a nude from a vase of flowers you are in with a good chance!

Expos, is, as far as I know, only available from the Musee du Louvre, the Musee des Beaux-Arts de Marseille and the Musee d'Orsay in France. My copy was obtained by contacting the Louvre by mail. It was a gift, so I am uncertain of price.

The game is in French, English rules can be provided.

There are 126 cards in full color, showing a detail of a famous painting (eg Gauguin's The White Horse or Van Gogh's Sunflowers) and classifying it by one of the 21 painters and one of the 12 themes.

Everything is on good quality card stock.

Also provided are 34 Event Cards which are drawn after each player's turn and detail things like Fire or Critical Success or compulsory or optional auction of a painting.

There are 6 'cheat sheets' or Expos Catalogs, giving the names of the painters and the categories. In French, but they're easy enough to work out for the most part, (eg: Nu, Portrait Masculin, Marine, Hist. Relig ou Allegories,etc) and translations are given in the rules. The painting cards are helpfully colour coded which assists)

Also 6 screens help people hide their Euros, and provide a place to hang exhibition posters (there are 2 of these for each painter [so only 2 players can exhibit Monet for example] and 3 per theme [so only 3 players can exhibit Marine scenes]

140 money and loan chips in Euros are provided to buy and sell the paintings with, and to go into debt to the bank with should things get hot...

The rules are provided in French, I am not certain if the English rules are provided without request.

The plastic insert of the box provides the revolving centre of the game. 10 painting cards are separated and the rest are divided more or less evenly into four and placed in each the four easels of the carousel. The information on the card is covered by the one of the numbered cardboard easels' insert so that the painting can be seen, but not who it's by or whether it is classified as a Nude, Historical, Marine, or whatever. 1,2,3,4.

The event cards are placed face down on one side of the middle of the carousel, the spare paintings on the other.

Players are given a screen, 100.000 Euro and a cheat sheet, and a starting hand of 4 paintings.

Play proceeds by a player choosing to a) buy a painting by spending 20,000 Euro and taking a painting from any of the easels or the top of the face down spare painting pile

OR

b) exhibit one or more collections (receiving 20,000 Euro)

You need two or more paintings by the same artist to make an exhibit, or three with the same theme. You take these from your hand and put them on the table face up, and hang the appropriate poster on your screen.

OR

do nothing. A player may also in each case choose to supplement an existing exhibition in which case they will get 5,000 Euro per exhibit, regardless of how many paintings are added.

They then must take an event card, react to it as required:  There may be a sudden auction, or the current exposed paintings may be destroyed or they may keep the card if it is one to be used later and then their turn is over.

The game ends when a player exhibits their 4th collection. The winner is the person with the most money at the end. The exhibitions worths are calculated using the chart on the cheat sheet.

Exhibits by artist gains the most points, but it is easier to collect by theme.

Unexhibited paintings: ie those still concealed in players' hands have a penalty of -5000 Euro each at the end of the game. Any debts are paid off if they can be.

Fast, attractive, as challenging as you want it to be.

It appears to have won some awards:
1997 Double D' Argent (Double Silver) Besancon Festival Internationa des nouveaux jeux
1998 De D'OR (Gold) Concours International de Boulogne Billancourt

18358,The Guildford Game,1994,5.5,2,0,2,6,0,0,,Economic Negotiation ,Roll / Spin and MoveSet CollectionStock HoldingTrading,"THE GUILDFORD GAME is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed by local YMCAs in the UK to generate funds for their activities.  The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case Guildford some 30 miles South West of London.

Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6.  When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes.  If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.

Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series.  Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.

Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.

The New Share Quotations square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies.  This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own.  It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.

The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:
-    After a set time.
-    When the first player becomes bankrupt.
-    When all but one player has gone bankrupt.

At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate.  The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.

In order to graduate you must pass through the finish square with 300 or more points.

Movement around the board is determined by a dice roll, though players are able to select the route they take.

The questions are concerned with providing a definition of a given word - if this can be done without any assistance 10 points are awarded - if however the player elects to be given three options from the card only 5 points are awarded for a correct answer.

Points gained are recorded on a notepad with players being able to progress from one educational institution to the next having earned the requisite number of points:
50 to leave primary School
100 to leave High School
200 to leave College.

The first player to reach the finish with more than 300 points is the winner.

The goal is to pick up as many of the other player's passengers as possible, delivering them to their destinations, collecting money and avoiding fines.

All players begin with $150.00 and 4 Passenger Pawns (same color as their taxi). Players distribute their Passenger Pawns on the board, as well as Bank owned Pawns and Police/Highway Patrol Cars.

The object is to pick up as many of the other players pawns as possible and deliver them to their destination (as determined by the draw from the card deck).  Taxi drivers collect $1/space driven from the owning player of the pawn, but the route must be direct because cheating gets you a $20.00 fine and a trip back to the garage.  The Bank pays for Bank Pawns. Whenever a Passenger Pawn is picked up, a Destination Card is drawn, but beware the random Hazard Card!

Police/Highway Patrol Cars are moved by the current player who rolls either a 1 or a 6. The object is to Bust one of the other taxis caught in its jurisdiction (spaces marked yellow on the board). When a player has picked all the pawns he can, they head back to the garage to end the game. The person with the most money wins the game. Bank Pawns in possession are worth $5.00 each.

The length of the game is dependent on the amount of players. Placement of the Bank Pawns also adds to the game length, since players can choose to keep a Bank Pawn, or put it into play:  more pawns in play equals a longer game.

You dont need to spend out hundreds of pounds on figures or spend hundreds of hours painting them to a fiddly, detailed degree. You can make do with scratch paper, your dice and a calculator or any other method of representing the battle you wish to use from miniatures to just keeping the whole idea in your head.

Feast of Crows, by necessity, abstracts the nature of role-playing combat further than it already is. While some heroes, magicians and warriors alike, or some monsters, tamed or bargained into helping an army can make an impact, it is usually as leaders of the rank and file and not as individuals that they will make their mark.

Feast of Crows requires little more preparation than a normal game or a normal set of character sheets and battles involving thousands of troops can be resolved just as quickly, if not more quickly, than normal party-level combat encounters while retaining the heroic, magical feel placed in gamers imaginations by The Lord of the Rings or other fantasy works.

Feast of Crows is a feast, not only for the scavengers of the battlefield but also for the gamer seeking a good solution to resolving large scale battles as part of their epic campaigns.

18373,Pig Wars: When Men Were Men and Pigs Were Money,1991,5.65625,16,2.6667,2,10,30,30,Wargames,Medieval Miniatures Wargame ,,"Pig Wars is a skirmish-level miniatures wargame set in the Dark Ages: after the Fall of Rome, before the Norman conquest of England.  Each figure represents one person.

Each player controls one unit of 20 figures and is given one 52-card deck of ordinary playing cards, which are used instead of dice in this game.  Each unit has one chit (or 3x5 card) used to determine activation randomly in a given turn.

Units are distinguished by a bar of color on the base: since ten players can be playing at once, and there are no uniforms in that era, this is important.  A number of stripes (from 0 to 3) on the color bar shows the morale level of the figure, from militia to average to proven veteran to elite veteran (leader).  This is important both in melee combat and morale checks.

Pigs are a frequent goal of a given scenario, hence the name of the game.  In fact, different units are given different objectives in a raid scenario, though things don't always work out the way one intends ... it can get a bit chaotic.

Cards are used to determine all random events: missile fire, combat, rallying, morale checks, etc.  The system is very easy to understand and there is very little in terms of a player aid needed.  The only downside to the card method is that a player goes through his entire deck before reshuffling, and if he notices all the good cards have been used early, it may change his tactics half way through the game as he becomes more conservative ...

Overall, a good light system, more for fun gaming than serious gaming.

The whole booklet is very short and the rules are very concise (not covering every possible detail), but still very playable.

This is a set of skirmish rules for wargaming, where one model equals one ship.  (However, if transporting troops, a based group of figures represents 500 foot soldiers or 250 horse.)

Set largely in the Mediterranean Sea, it deals with both sailing and oared ships.  Only a few of the ships have cannons - most do not, in this era - but most forts have them.

Rules are given for movement by oar and sail (wind is a factor), beaching, launching, shelter from the wind, and also for land units transported by these ships.  Combat covered includes cannon fire, small arms fire, hand-to-hand fighting, and morale.  Rules for terrain are covered, including islands, beaches, assaulting a fort, etc.

Each player has three pieces to represent his team. There is a ball. A goal is scored when a team successfully lands a piece carrying the ball in its opponent's end zone. The game ends when one team has successfully scored five goals.

Each turn, pieces of the team with the ball -- the offensive team -- can either move or pass the ball. The defensive team's pieces can only move in an attempt to take possession of the ball. If the defensive team takes the ball, it becomes the offensive team.

Moves and passes are declared in secret and then simultaneously revealed. Pieces move simultaneously.

In each turn, both players place one of their pieces in an intersection of the board.  If the intersection chosen by both players is the same, a neutral piece is placed instead. Otherwise, both pieces just placed define a rectangle of intersections on the board.  The player who has more pieces inside that rectangle (the pieces in the borders of the rectangle are not counted) earns a point.  The first player to earn a total of ten points is the winner.

The rules cover creating the terrain and its effect on movement and combat.  Rules are given for the various types of dinosaur attacks (as well as fire-breathing) and defenses.  Various dinosaurs are covered in particular: Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, Stegasaurus, Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, etc., and which period they were found in.  Actions are broken down into 12 phases: faster creatures get an action each phase, while a slower one might only act every third phase.

Each die represents an individual in a tribe, and the four types of markers represent food, houses, art, and penalties.

Each round all players roll all their dice to determine the productivity of the individual tribe members.  Players then allocate the roll values, aka productivity, towards food, housing, more tribe members, or art.

Board has a path across the center that you move on if you roll either even or odd. Also upgrades to your software come in the form of computer magazine awards which you receive from drawing cards (ie chance and community chest cards)

Also it isn't just pass go collect $200 the more programs you own the more you collect, also you collect payments from the bank when competitors land on your space.

One other interesting feature is that you can stage a hostile takeover and claim a piece of software from someone if you draw the right card.

Game ends when someone gets to 1 billion dollars cash.

The company's one, and as far as I can tell only, press release:
SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 25, 1995--Yes! Your Expression Solution !nc. proudly announces the release of TechnoTycoon(TM), the fun and exciting board game where the object is to become a BILLionaire(TM).

In the last decade the software industry has created more millionaires and billionaires than any other industry. Microsoft alone has created the world's richest individual as well as a few other billionaires and several thousand millionaires. Now, with TechnoTycoon it's your turn....

You begin with $50 million. As you play, you acquire various software products by paying their development cost, hoping the return in sales amasses you a fortune of over a billion dollars. TechnoTycoon's software products are parodies of best-selling software and include familiar names like WinDoze, Fun-2-3, WordPurrrrfect, Cyberpunk-In-A-Box, HardWork Graphics and 30 others....

As the players move around the board, they receive sales when other players land on their software. If your software wins awards from computer magazines such as PC Geek, MacAbuser, WinDoze Magazine...sales skyrocket. And if you're fortunate enough to own a software suite, sales are more lucrative for each suite member.

You can cruise the Information Super Highway to faster upgrades and a better chance at becoming a BILLionaire. But watch out for hostile takeovers, the Justice Department, and greedy lawyers. Advertising, taxes and new versions are costs which should be avoided. TechnoTycoon is a game that will be enjoyed by nerds and non-nerds alike.

The price of TechnoTycoon is $29.95 (Washington residents add sales tax of $2.46). TechnoTycoon is only available directly from YES! Your Expression Solution. To order, call 800/U-BUY-FUN (800/828-9386) or send check or money order to YES!, P.O. Box 5753, Kent, WA 98064-5753.

There have been four major campaigns, of which those of 1967 and 1973 - the so-called 'Six Days' and 'Yom Kippur' Wars - are of particular interest to wargamers as they involved the largest tank battles since World War 2. Israeli Centurions, Pattons and M-60s vie for battlefield supremacy with Arab T-54s and T-62s, and the arena has become a testing ground for new weapon systems and tactical doctrines while retaining an overall similarity to the armoured conflict of World War 2 which forms the subject matter of earlier books in this series.

This book begins with an introduction to the subject, a short chapter on the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and a detailed description, with maps, of the 1967 and 1973 campaigns. There are two detailed chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured fighting vehicles and their characteristics, anti-tank missiles, conventional artillery, infantry weapons, tactical missiles, minefields and helicopters. There are also chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured organisation and tactics, and two specially commissioned sections on the war in the air by Mike Spick, author of Air Battles in Miniature. Finally, there are detailed playing rules, an appendix listing model suppliers, a technical glossary and an index, making this the ideal book for the increasing numbers of wargamers interested in this fascinating arena.

SETUP: The board is a circle consisting of 7 rings, divided into 24 segments. There is a circle in the center called the dead zone. There are 12 black counters and 12 white counters. Arrange these on the board on the outer spaces (one per space on the outer ring of the board), with the black pieces closest to the black player, and the white pieces closest to the white player.

PLAY: Players take turns moving one piece per turn. The pieces may be moved forward (toward or away from the center of the board) or sideways (left or right around the ring). The pieces may be moved as far as the player wishes, but must not leave the board on the outside, enter the dead zone, move diagonally or jump a piece in its way.

To capture a piece, you must move your piece so that it completes a surround, then remove the captured piece from the board.

Produced by AH in 1974, concurrent with the Witchcraft Ritual Kit.
Both kits were based on research by Dr. Brooke Hayward Jennings.

From the back of the box:

Please read carefully. You have in your possession a kit that allows you to simulate the magic circle accurate with all the specifics needed for the hour of casting according to traditional rituals.

You have further a ritual made of authentic, traditional passages of the textbooks of magic.

It is precisely from such elements that the tradition of magic and spirit conjuration have been derived.

The makers of this kit have been concerned only to explain the principle parts and demonstrate how the magic tradition is used. The consequences of performing the ritual are dependent upon the psychic awareness level and skill of the performer.  It is here recognized that persons vary as to their level of psychic awareness and belief in spirit worlds.

No claims are made with this kit as to results.  The ritual has been modified to assure beneficial spirits. Use of the kits for other purposes is beyond control of the maker.

Use the kit in fun and stay within the confines of the spirit indicated.  These spirits are good and will serve you well.  And, you may have fun as your mind and spirit relate to these forces.

Convert the image to malevolent spirits at your risk. Remember Crowley's warning that the textbooks of magic are all that are required to conjure any spirit.

Also soft skin and truck-mounted gun charts, and very detailed army and equipment lists for all thirteen nations. Usable with 1/300th, 1/76th or 15mm scales, these rules have a 1:1 ratio, though infantry are based in fire teams/crews. Infantry fire-fights are quickly resolved and require only 1 dice thrown per group of combatants, with casualties being complete teams.

These rules are complete, no future supplements or expansions will be needed. Page count has increased from 70 to 121 pages.

In the first phase each player decides the number of steps that he wants to move one of his building. Accordingly it takes and puts as many Oracle stones into its right hand, while keeping the remaining Oracle stones covered in the left hand. Every player place a bet on the total amount of Oracle stones that will be played in the current round by all players (it's not permitted to call a number already called by a previous player). After each player called a value, everyone open their right hand, and if someone called the exact value, he will have benefits in the third phase.

In the second phase every player moves one of his buildings (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) according to number of Oracle stones played. During the movement one can jump over one or more buildings, but the target field must be however free. If one jumps over an opponent building with the next to last point of movement, he can strike this at the end of its movement, if he wants to. The building is then put again into the supply of the opponent.

In the third phase only the player that called exactly the value in the first phase can place one of its temple on a free starting position on the board. If all starting positions are occupied or if the player has already all temples on the board, the action is not taken.

For every sitting of a game, one story, along with 5 related questions, is used. This item is known as a Case 'N Questions.

Total Score = Points x Friendo Chips.

The objective of FRIENDO is to maximize Total Score.  To do that, you must be able to 1)correctly guess how others answer their questions AND 2)partner-up with somebody and correctly guess each other's answers.

If you stay single, (i.e. without a partner), you get no Friendo Chip, and thus, will always have a Total Score of zero.

Game is over when either 1)all the answers (20 if there are 4 players) have been guessed or recalled or 2)when, as a result of players going bankrupt of Points, only 3 players are left on the board.  There must be at least 4 players for a game to continue.  Then, whoever has the most Total Score wins.

Players take turns to roll a die and move that number of spaces round the board. The player then tries to answer a question determined by both the colour of the space he or she lands on, and the actual number rolled on the die. If the question is answered correctly the player moves forwards an additional three spaces as a reward. There is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.

The question categories are:

Orange - History  This And That
Yellow - People
White - Places
Green - Showbiz
Blue - Best of British luck
Red - Sport
Brown - Up The Creek

The questions for Sport, History  This  That, People, Places and Showbiz all require straight answers to a straight forward question.

The questions for the Best of British luck are in a different format with 6 different types available - Multiple Choice, Odd Man Out, Missing Letters, Anagrams, Whereabouts, and Draw - with the last four of these categories being conducted against a 30 second timer.

'Up The Creek' is a special category that asks the player to perform an activity rather than answer a question. If the player fails to carry out the activity to the satisfaction of the other players, or refuses to even try, he or she has to move backwards three spaces.

The winner is the first player to complete a circuit of the track around the board.

The board is divided into four regions, one for each player, representing a village in the African Bush, the Amazon Basin, the Sahel Belt or South East Asia. An information card for each area provides details of the kind of assistance required and the types of trained personnel required to provide it - this varies from region to region.

Players take it in turns to move their Community Leader around the outer circuit of the board the number of spaces determined by the roll of either one or two dice. In so doing the players collect (and on occasion lose) a variety of Community workers, Medics, Technicians, Teachers and Social workers. The directions in the spaces also initiate good or bad events in the region.

At various points on the board these helpers can be used to develop part of their village. The player developing the Sahel Belt, for example, will need to construct a safe water supply, Milk Processing Plant, Health Care Center, School etc... Construction requires then right compliment of experts and may also cost points which are earned through completing circuits of the board.

The construction undertaken and equipment purchased is represented on the board by a series of jig-saw pieces which are placed within a frame that is positioned over the game board. The pieces can be added into the frame in any order, but successful redevelopment of a village will require a total of 11 pieces.

The winner is the player that is first to have successfully reconstructed his or her village by covering the developing area with 11 reconstruction pieces.

The sinews that kept the empire together were the ships of the Royal Navy, and later, those of the Commonwealth nations. Today, just like it was in the past, whenever those ships sail, one can see the White Ensign.

White Ensign discusses each conflict in which Commonwealth naval forces were involved from 1960 to the present day.

Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the modern Royal Navy outside of official publications and a valuable reference book in its own right, White Ensign is meant to be used as a supplement to Harpoon4 and requires the use of Harpoon4 rules to derive the maximum value from it. All ships, from carriers down to patrol/fast attack craft, as well as ships taken up from trade (STUFT) during the Falklands War are included in the ship data annex, as are all aircraft that were or could have been used in a naval environment.

Each round, one of the cards is turned face up, showing a pattern that can be made with the two pieces and their image in the mirror.

Simultaneously, both players try to create the pattern on the card with their two pieces. The first player who manages this gets the card, which counts as a victory point. When the deck is exhausted, the player with the most cards wins.

For solitaire play, the rule book includes extra patterns using all four pieces.

In this game, you're one of four Banshees racing to be the first to collect five skulls from the surrounding tombs.

Next you peer inside the tomb, hoping to find a skull to steal (the skeletons don't mind because then they're able to watch the race, which they enjoy greatly), and hoping not to find a Vampire (because you would then have to give the Vampire a skull for having disturbed him). Racing away with a skull, you think you might WIN this time...and then you see the horrible Zombie lurching towards you, intent on eating...that's right....your SKULL!!!

(MIDNIGHT BANSHEES has a spinner under the gameboard,
so you never know which tomb might contain a Vampire!)

According to the rules none of these games had been published before, although in fact at least a few are traditional games. Ravensburger catalog #12.026

The game box includes several sets of multi colored pawns used in all games and 3 double sided hard playing boards.

The games included are:

Quicki - a dice rolling race game where players move around an abstract grid of points trying to reach their colored places in the board center, players can be sent back to their starting places by other players choosing to land on their current position.

Ponte - from the translated rulebook: The object of the game is to reach the island by crossing streets and bridges with one figure as fast as possible and then build a tower and reach it by jumps.

The Magic Star - The object of the game is to try to move clockwise around the star on the outer or inner path beginning from the starting point.  The player who manages to get all of his game figures into his own star corner first wins the game.  A blockade figure constantly changes the aspect of the game.

Piggy Back - The object of the game is to get all the figures across the board first, whereby the players are forced at times to carry the opponent's figures piggy-back across the board or even to be carried in the same way themselves in order to reach their destination.  The point of the game is to try to take advantage of the piggy back rule whenever possible.

Fox Jumping - A gathering of foxes (2 or 4 fox families make 40 foxes) is disturbed by a hunting party.  Hastily each fox tried to hide in one of the 39 neighboring dens.  But since there is room for one fox in each den, the slowest fox loses the race.

Surakarta - This game originated in Indonesia.   It bears the name of the old time-honored city of Surakarta on the island of Middle Java.  The game is played on a grid of points with all points on the outer edge connected by a curved line that leads back to another board edge.  The idea is to move your pawns around the grid trying to get to a curved line that can be used to move to another side of the board and more importantly eliminate your opponents pawn.  The game is played actively in Indonesia by drawing lines in the ground and playing with pebbles.

In Crown of the Elder Kings players assume roles of tyrants and villains in the world of Runebound, gathering vassals to become Elder King. The goal is to be the first to collect a set of three vassals (blue challenges), which triggers the endgame. When this happens, other players try to defeat that player and his or her vassals.

Cards can be discarded or used in a battle. When the draw deck is empty, the ship sinks, and there is a showdown to see who ends up in which lifeboat. Points are totaled for the hand, and multiple hands add up to a game target of 200.

A variation for 6-8 players and two decks is included.

Components are the rules and a battle mat depicting the pirate ship and lifeboats. Illustrations by John Kovalic.

From the intro paragraph:

The rats are long gone, but you're still here. You and your greedy pirate pals are hustling around the deck of a sinking pirate ship, trying to scoop up as much treasure as you can hold. You've got to have a little treasure to buy your way into a lifeboat, and the best lifeboats are the ones with the most treasure in them. It's kind of complicated. Then again, maybe you're just not very smart.

Note that each color of elite blockset is sold separately, so you'll need at least two elite sets (presumably a red elite, and a blue elite set each to start with) in order to allow play with elite units.

Like the original game's 50 units per side, each Elite blockset has 50 block units, but in 12 new unit types: elite fighters, torpedo bombers, medium bombers, destroyers, cruisers, elite armor, artillery, mechanized, mountain, engineers, marines, supply and resource units.

At the start of the game, a random maze of Mirror Blocks is set up on the board.  Players use their spatial relations skills to try to predict various paths through the maze in an attempt to find the highest-scoring path.

In the simplest version of the game, the player is allowed to see the arrows on top of the Mirror Blocks to find scoring paths that lead to Target Pegs.  The instructions also include optional rules to increase the difficulty of game-play for more expert players.  Players can move or rotate a Mirror Block to increase their score or to try to block their opponent.

The player places the View Cube at the beginning of a selected path.  They then place their finger on the Target Peg that they think is at the end of the path.  The player looks down into the View Cube.  If the predicted Peg is seen, the player scores by adding the values of the Mirror Blocks and the Target Peg to their existing score.  If the selected Target Peg is not correct, the player scores nothing

Mirror Mania is a fun and relatively quick-playing game, and the Day-Glo hot pink, electric yellow, and fire orange Mirror Cubes are a retro blast!

Each player has 15 unique pieces in his own color, arranged on the dark squares of the nearest three ranks. From left to right, the pieces are one through five stars (first rank), moons (second rank) and suns (third rank).

The pieces move one square diagonally in any direction to a vacant square, or must leap over one opposing piece (only opposing pieces, but without capture - there are no captures in Salta) if the square immediately beyond is vacant. Only one jump is made (no chain jumping), and missed opportunities to jump may be forced by the opponent, although a player is free to choose among several available jumps. Blockading all of the opposing pieces is not allowed, although some may be temporarily blocked as long as the opponent still has a legal move.

The goal is to be the first player to move all of his pieces as into the starting places of the corresponding opposing piece. That is, reading from right to left, the goal position is one through five stars (tenth rank), one through five moons (ninth rank) and one through five suns (eighth rank). The player first achieving this position wins by as many points as the number of moves opponent would need to achieve his goal position.

If neither player reaches the goal position by the time 120 moves have been made by each player, the score is calculated as the difference between the number of moves each player would need to reach the goal position, as if the board were clear of opposing pieces.

You you can play over the story from about the first 100 novellas issued. The game is broken up in different phases which you can play separately or one after another for a very long game. The phases with different backsides are:

Phase I: Die Dritte Macht (The Third Power, 1996)
Phase II/III: Topsider  Springer (1996)
Phase IV: Vorsto nach Arkon (Approach to Arkon, 1997)
Phase V: Atlan  Arkon (2003)

Fanpro canceled the game in 1998. Finally Between The Stars (a company founded by fans of the game) took over and released phase V in 2003.

The player with the most victory points wins this complex game. You get victory points for completing phases and for completing side plots. Only after a phase is completed the players can draw cards from the next phase (you need separate decks for each phase you will play).

The cards show different planets, star systems, mutants with psi-talents, other persons, troops, spaceships, fleets, accessories, event cards and galactic riddles. There is also an action card deck to randomize the fights someway.

Every card can be Pro, Anti, or both (Dual). In a game you have to play two sides at the same time, the pro-side (the good guys) and the anti-side (the bad boys). After you have built up your fleets and armies (you normally hide them below other cards) you fight space fights and invasions on enemy planets: With your anti-side you attack the pro-sides of your opponents, and with your pro-side you damage their anti-sides.

Using the game scales in Les Grognards 2nd Edition, small actions from a few companies up to multiple Corps  are possible.  The three game scales allow experimentation with games of different scopes and scales  with existing troops and mounting systems.  All three scales use the same basing system; there is no need for rebasing.

Les Grognards 2nd Edition also includes Horizon Movement rules for the Battalion and Grand Tactical scale games.  Horizon Movement eliminates virtually all measuring for movement.  Horizon movement allows units to move based on the tabletop terrain and enemy unit's positions.  Rather than measuring moves in small increments, moves are  made based on limiting terrain or tactical situations.  The result is a game that features dynamic, flowing movement rather than the same moves broken down into small increments as in standard measured movement games.

The Grand Tactical game uses the infantry regiment as the standard infantry game unit - allowing players to command Corps on the tabletop.

These rules plead no cause - most of the causes for which these past warriors fought are long ago gone. In many cases the winners would be surprised if they returned today to view modern South Africa, Egypt, China, or Morocco. So what these rules celebrate is the honor and bravery of men who fought for lost reasons in remote and alien lands and the courage of men who attempted to save a doomed and, in some cases, brutish way of life.

It also commemorates some of the kindest, meanest, most charitable, most selfish, bravest, most craven, brightest and most incorrigibly ignorant people that have ever walked the earth: the Victorian on a mission, the Calif with murder in his heart, the merciless Zulu, the totally mad Gordon confronting the equally mad Mahdi.

The different game scales allow for a wide variety of scenarios, game sizes, and game types.

The Game Scale Rules section includes unique rules for each of the three scale games included in the The Blitzkrieg game supplement (Squad, Platoon, and Battalion).  Each game scale has its own Weapon Adjustment Table, game play reference sheet, quick rating BDV Tables, and organizational information.

This allows a gamers to play everything from a vicious, house-to-house skirmish combat to a multi-division, multi-day battle on the plains of Russia.  The movement, combat, and morale sections of the rules were deliberately developed to fit the zoom concept mentioned in the original Piquet rules.  By using a few unique rules, and different troop ratings, a gamer can easily move between the three scales.  The basic rule mechanics are the same, only the details change.  The Squad scale game is new with this version of the rules.  It allows for large skirmish actions, instead of the small, highly individually personalized game typical of skirmish rules.  The Squad game allows skirmish detail in games with a platoon or more of infantry on a side.   The detail players enjoy in skirmish games is still there, but it is imbedded in the game system.  As an example, it would be very easy to just add rules to the basic rule skeleton to handle unique cases.  Consider armor in a skirmish game.   Obviously, there is a difference in the combat readiness of a tank that is buttoned up compared to one which is just moving down a road.  The Squad game easily handles this difference by requiring that vehicles be in a declared status - either march or deployed.  March status indicates a tank or vehicle that is not combat ready, but is primarily intent on moving rapidly.  Deployed status indicates a tank or vehicles that is tactically aware prepared for the uncertainties of the battlefield.

Anchor of Faith allows the gamer to recreate the battles and tactics of this colorful period.

Anchor of Faith covers warfare in Europe and the fringe nations in the Middle East and Asia. The supplement introduces new rule mechanisms, formation types and army generation tables particular to the period 1600 to 1690. It combines the main rules that allow battles to be played at a regimental scale, and a sub set of rules, the Twelve Apostles, for fighting smaller actions with units typically representing a few companies of infantry or troops of cavalry. The latter being particularly useful for fighting large English Civil War skirmishes.

Anchor of Faith includes a range of new formations definitions including tercios, Swedish brigade, deep line, caracole cavalry, commanded shot, galloper cavalry and war wagons. New period rule mechanisms are introduced to mirror both the abilities and shortcomings of the troops of this era. New rules include revised pursuit rules, morale points by command and new fire rules to reflect the low effect of musketry and the importance of  push of pike in deciding the outcome of engagements.  Many of the new ideas and mechanisms can be used in other Piquet periods.

18712,Piquet: Band of Brothers,2004,7.25,8,1,2,6,90,90,Wargames,Expansion for Base-game Medieval Miniatures Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemDice Rolling,"From the designer:

Band of Brothers was a pleasant surprise for me as I found my interest in the period became greater the longer I worked on this supplement.  If one is looking for a variety of unit types, tactical doctrine, or weaponry, medieval/renaissance warfare has much to offer.  If one wants colorful dress and dramatic costumes, then the Landtsknecht and the Ottoman Janissaries are but a few of the many available troops.   Even more appealing is that this is a period of fascinating transitions in the practice of warfare.

Two of the greatest transitional effects are the introduction and growing effectiveness of gunpowder weapons, both in the form of artillery, as well as personal weapons, and the ability for nations to field semi-national armies.  The creation of these larger forces and their supply was a necessary social foundation for the Military Revolution that allowed the great armies of the 17th century and later.

18713,Grand Piquet,2004,8.75,2,2,2,6,90,90,Wargames,Miniatures Napoleonic Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemDice Rolling,"Grand Piquet 2nd Edition - Many changes were made for this new edition of Grand Piquet.  The Army commander now plays a more pivotal role in the command and control of a Corps.  These formations no longer move whenever or wherever they wish.    A D12 is now the basis for all initiative rolls, which effectively eliminates the need for phases, as well as mitigates the wild swings in initiative.    The Sequence decks have been radically altered. Now there are Action cards, by type of unit [e.g. Infantry Action card], whereby there is much greater flexibility in actions taken by units.  Also, the basic Sequence deck is now made up of 20 cards, instead of 28.  The combat system is based primarily on Target type, so there are fewer modifiers to calculate. The basic concept of chipping within the morale system is intact, yet there is no need to keep track of morale chips. Unit / sub unit designations are determined by numbers of men and not by regiment.  Players determine the size and make up of a unit, thereby effectively tailoring each Command Group to a particular situation or task.  These are but a few of the changes that have been made. 
It is hoped that this new edition will keep the flavor and excitement of the original, while improving the mechanics, which will give a more fluid, less static feel to the game.  One final comment that deserves remembering:  Piquet is an innovative system designed to give players the opportunity to make command decisions based upon finite resources.

Not only is the Great War (1914 - 1918) covered in detail, so is the Russo-Japanese War (1904 - 1905), Russian Civil War (1917 - 1921), and the Russo-Polish War (1919 - 1920). Typical unit sizes are infantry companies, cavalry squadrons, machine gun platoons, and artillery batteries. A player would generally command either a regiment or a brigade of soldiers.

The rules will work equally well for those who want to depict the early Search and Destroy days of the war against the VC and for those who want to recreate the desperate days of the 1975 collapse.  In general, the Vietnam War was fought at the company level, with the platoon of 2 - 4 squads (representing anywhere from 20 to over 40 men) being the basic maneuver element.  Previously, this scale has been neglect by most miniatures rules dealing with the Vietnam War, which have focused on the individual's perspective.  Forgotten Heroes enables the you to command a full infantry company (of 3 - 4 platoons) or more, and the accompanying assets, in a way no other Vietnam War era rules set has done before.  It is only in this Scale that the gamer can really recreate the village sweeps, helicopter insertions into hot LZs, assaults on bunker complexes, VC convoy ambushes, riverine actions, and fire base assaults, that typified the major actions of this conflict.

Forgotten Heroes includes rules for the unique aspects of the Vietnam War.  These rules include the following: VC/NVA tunnel systems, riverine craft, civilians, caches and stores, rules of engagement, booby traps, ground surveillance radar, command detonated mines, night combat effects, and many more.  Forgotten Heroes also includes special event cards that can be added to the normal sequence decks, such as Chieu Hoi, DiDi Mau, General Visits Front, Hearts and Minds, Media Circus, the dreaded FUBAR, and more.

Forgotten Heroes bas been designed to be as accessible as possible to both a newcomer to the Vietnam War and he gaming veteran.  The rules include information on the varied equipment used in the war and full TOEs for the US Army, US Marine Crops, ARVN, Australians, Viet Cong, and NVA.  Two introductory scenarios are included, as a bonus supplement, rules are provided for the First Indochina War including sequence decks, equipment and weapon lists, and TO Es for the French and Viet Minh.

18717,Piquet:  Theater of War,2004,6.7,5,0,2,6,90,90,Wargames,Expansion for Base-game Miniatures Wargame ,Campaign / Battle Card Driven,"Theater of War generates linked, tactical tabletop games in a larger strategic setting. Theater of War is designed to be used with miniature collections of existing, fixed sizes (no more collecting and painting forces for the next game just in order to meet the order of battle requirements!) while providing an entertaining background for a campaign with a definitive conclusion. Theater of War provides a system for determining tactical scenarios, based on decisions made by the campaign players. Theater of War includes rules for organizing campaigns in all of the periods covered by the Piquet rule system.

Theater of War vividly represents the fog and friction of war, modeled by sequence decks and initiative rolls. Battle Hands made up of Sequence cards are used to move from the campaign map to the tabletop. Battle hands determine what type of tabletop battle will be fought, as well as any particular advantages (relative army sizes, terrain, set-up) that will exist.  This combination and interplay of Battle Hands is the heart and soul of Theatre of War.  It allows a campaign to be fought without an umpire making rulings about force strengths and scenario definition, as well as providing for pre-battle maneuvering as both sides attempt to gain an advantage. Theatre of War places the gamer in the predicament of not knowing for sure what the tabletop game will hold - that is, not knowing until they've committed and played their cards!

Theatre of War is designed to provide a campaign framework for Piquet tabletop miniature games.  In order to play Theatre of War, both the Piquet master rules and the period supplement in which the campaign is set are required.

18720,Piquet: PKowboys,2004,8,1,0,2,6,90,90,Wargames,American West Expansion for Base-game Miniatures Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemDice Rolling,"Pkowboys is intended to represent skirmish combat between rival gangs (outlaws, lawmen, gunslingers, and townsfolk) in the American West between 1860 and 1900.  Players represent the leaders of different gangs, or in large battles a player may act as the leader of multiple gangs.

Pkowboys does not use the standard Piquet initiative system.  Instead, We have developed a fast an furious method to handle individual figure movement and action on the tabletop.

Here are the principles behind the design of Pkowboys.

Western combat was quick and decisive.    Gun battles lasted minutes or seconds. Any shot has the chance of being lethal. Many gunfighters lost their nerve and fled when under fire. Leadership was as important with gangs of outlaws or lawmen as it was in large battles. The Jesse James/Wild Bill Hickock Theory:  being unlucky is a bad thing no matter how good you are. Gunfight tactics in a nutshell:  move into a good position and shoot like mad.

Pelotn can be played as miniatures rules, or as an aid to RPGs in those combat situations in which the excessive number of prominent figures makes the action slow.

If they have guessed  correctly the bone springs out and that person wins the game; if they are incorrect they must take no further part in that round.

A marble can move by jumping over another marble or a chain. Furthermore, if a move causes a triangle to be empty, the player can reposition it anywhere he wants, as long as it touches the board.
The ever-changing board and the player interactivity (every problem is solved by voting) make Bermude an original family game; but it is not as easy as it seems.

You begin by drafting your team, then you roll dice to advance around the board. Each time around the board equals one week in the season. There are 200 player cards with stats on the back broken down into 17 weeks. The stats are their actual performance last year, with a column for their fantasy points each week. There are also 16 rookie cards with newly drafted rookies and their projected stats for 2005. At the end of each week, you add up the points for the players on your team and compete against a different player each time around the board.
                                     
Several things can happen while playing the game as you advance around the board. You can be forced to trade with another person, you can pick up free agents, your players can get injured or suspended,you can get plus or minus points for the week,etc.
                                     
You accumulate season points, as well as wins and losses. The 2 or 4 teams with the most wins advance to a playoff round, and a champion is determined.

18761,The Three Musketeers,1861,3.5,6,2,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Novel-based World War II ,Point to Point Movement,"This game dates back to at least 1861, when it was published by John Jaques  Son as The Royal Garrison Game. It is an extension of  The Siege Game, a.k.a. German Tactics which itself seems descended from Fox and Geese. In this game, 17 points of its 67-point game board are set aside as a garrison. Three officers begin play in the garrison, and fifty attackers begin play on all the remaining points of the board. Officers can move in any direction along any lines and jump over attackers to remove them from the board; attackers move only along vertical or diagonal lines towards the garrison and cannot capture officers, but instead merely try to swarm the garrison. To win, the attackers must occupy every point in the garrison, while the officers must capture enough attackers to make such occupation impossible.

This game has been known in English-speaking countries by a number of names, including Officers and Sepoys, The Royal Garrison, The Three Guardsmen, The Three Musketeers, Yellow Peril, and Bataan: The Battle of the Philippines!.  In continental Europe it has usually been known as some variation of Belagerungsspiel Siege Game or Festungspiel Fortress Game and was sometimes published together with its immediate ancestor under the same name.

This game does not have a game board per-se - it utilizes a 3-D supposedly haunted dwelling resembling a castle or mansion for gameplay.  The model measures about 35cm high x 20cm across x 15cm deep.

The small black plastic vampire bats are placed on a spring-loaded platform at the top of the model.  The players select one of the two garishly colored neon plastic Monster Claws each.

Marbles are inserted into the top of the dwelling and roll through passages within the interior of the model.  The route of the marbles can be manipulated by using the 'Skunker Skulls' - little green skulls which are located at the base of the castle.  The marbles may roll completely through the model (there are instructions, such as Take Another Turn where these terminate) or they may activate the spring-loaded platform where the plastic vampire bats have been placed.  The bats are propelled into the air and must be caught in one's Monster Claw.

Inside the spheres at each end are magnets, so the magnetic fields generated by the sphere you're trying to place may repulse that of the sphere atop the tower (hence the game title, Repulsion), and so success in the game is dictated by your ability to delicately determine the polarities of your piece and that atop the tower without toppling the tower, and place your piece safely on top.

18777,Oasis,1937,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Travel ,Roll / Spin and Move,"This appears to be a game of Zionist tourism or return to the Promised Land.  The box measures 19 1/8 by 9 5/8 by 1 3/4.  It is finished in a diagonal woven texture in tan with some blue-gray highlighting.  In the upper left corner of the lid is a glued-on label.  The label depicts an oasis with several palm trees, green grass, a pool of water, and several people, one seated on a camel.

The label reads: Game of OASIS (trade mark) The Romance of the Promised Land Copyright MCMXXXVII by Milton Bradley Co. Springfield Mass. Made in U.S.A.  In the lower left of the label is the number 4029.

The mounted board measures 18 1/2 by 18 1/4.  The board features a light-blue background.  In the center is a round map of Palestine locating several cities, some settlements, and taking pains to point out a single Electric Works.

A large circle fills most of the board.  This circle is divided into three concentric rings with spaces, most of which are illustrated with detailed drawings of buildings, historic sites and other features of Palestine.

These spaces are divided into one yellow, one pink, and one green zone, divided by three equidistant spokes in blue.  One of these spokes depicts the Mediterranean coast with several steamers approaching Haifa and Tel Aviv (this spoke is labeled START).

A second spoke is labeled Yarkon River, and the third, Jordan River.  Each colored zone has three blank white spaces, one in each of the three rings.  The yellow and pink zones each have twelve colored spaces, while the green zone has fifteen.

Some examples of these zones (with drawings) include Jaffa Namal, Pay 5 sh Mehes; Hotel--300 sh;  Rachel's Tomb--Visit;  Keren Kayemeth--Land Free--100 sh Dev.; Factory Site--100 sh -- 300 sh Dev.; Hulleh Swamps -- Contribute; Bialik's Home--Contribute Writer's Fund 5 sh;  Herzl Forest--Plant Trees; Wailing Wall--Visit; Arab Land--40sh--100 sh Dev.; Hebrew University--Scholarship 50 sh; Hadassah Hospital--Contribute.  There are many more.

The game includes four wooden pawns in green, orange, red, and white.  The game also uses small dreidels, with green, orange, red, and white shafts, in place of dice.  A very large number of die-cut card shekels in denominations 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 are included, along with a set of 32 very sturdy green cards with text on one side (blank on back).  These cards are as heavy as the old green flags that came with Tinkertoys fifty years ago.

Some examples of card texts: If you have paid your dues and are a member of the HISTADRUTH (Federation of Labor) you may go to the Hadassah Hospital and receive Medical Care free of charge.

This is the eve of Pesah (Passover).  Cleanse your home of Hometz (Leaven) and move 5 spaces forward.

This is the 13th day of Adar which commemorates the Yahrzeit (the anniversary of the death) of Joseph Trumpeldor.  Go to Tel Hai and visit the grave of this great national hero who sacrificed his life defending Jewish settlements in Palestine.

Go to Petah Tikvah to supervise a cooperative Pardess (orange grove).  Collect 5 SH'KOLIM from each OLEH.

Go to Jerusalem to the Immigration Dept. to obtain certificates for Halutzim (Pioneers) who wish to settle in Palestine.

Unfortunately, this otherwise well-preserved game was found with no rules.  Attempts to find rules through the Milton Bradley rules site, and generally on the Internet, have proven unsuccessful.  As an artifact, the game provides a fascinating glimpse into the aspirations of a people in the final years before WW II.

Players try to take the most cards.  The deck is comprised of only six different types of cards:  magenta, red, yellow, green, cyan and blue.  Each round a player starts with 6 dealt cards, and may do one of four actions: Show, Activate, Combine and Take.  To show a card a player takes a card out of is hand and places it on the table in front of him, it still belongs to him.  To activate, take a show card and place it in the center of the table, which now belongs to all.  To Combine, a player may take one card from his hand and combine it with one of his show cards, combine two of his show cards, combine one of his show cards with an active card, or two active cards.  Only cards whose colors are one color apart on the color wheel may be combined.  For example red and blue makes magenta, and blue and cyan makes green.  To Take cards, a player takes one of his show cards (or a combination as if it were the combined color) and an active card, (or combination) and puts them aside for scoring at the end of the round.  To take, the colors must be exactly opposite on the color wheel, for example a blue show card (or magenta, cyan combination) takes yellow active card (or red, green combination).

Advanced rules allow combining more than two cards to make combinations, thus yellow combined with a blue/red combination (as if it were magenta) makes red.

Although the number of players is stated as 2 to 6, there is no five player version.  Two decks of 36 cards, six of each color come with the game, one deck is used for 2 or 3 players, both are used for 4 or 6 players.

On a player's turn, they either add a stone or hat to the board, or move a stone or hat on the board.  When they think they have four of their stones lined up, they remove the hats.  If they did not have their stones lined up, they lose.

You play to 10,000 points, hence the name, but the first one there does not necessarily win. The time it takes to play is about ten minutes per player. Even the very young can play  with a little help. You score points by throwing 100s, 50s, or 3 or more of a kind of anything. Every game is different and fun because the dice thrower must decide whether to continue to try for more points at greater risk.

The game comes with 6 custom dice, rules, a points card, velour carrying pouch and packaged in a beautifully embossed TEN GRAND box.

This game is similar to Dice 10,000 and Farkle. It originated in the 1930s (Hugo Kastner: Die groe Humboldt Enzyklopdie der Wrfelspiele. Humboldt 2007, pp. 205-208).

18813,Congo,1982,5.66667,9,3,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Animals ,,"Over the 1982-1983 Christmas holiday, Demian Freeling's father, famed abstract game designer Christiaan Freeling, suggested to his then seven-year-old son that he should design a chess-like game using a seven-by-seven board and seven yet to be defined pawns on the second rank and a royal piece in the middle. Drawing on his own experience with Chess and Xiang-Qi, Demian came up with Congo in just over an hour's time. Games tend to be fairly quick and bloody.

Set on an African Savannah with a river running horizontally across the board, the central royal piece is, of course, a lion, and a player wins by capturing the opposing lion. Lions move by stepping one space in any direction, but (except to capture the opposing lion for the win, which it can do by facing the opposing lion on an open file) is confined to the three-by-three area in the middle of its side of the board.

Reading the initial setup across the first rank, there is a zebra that moves and captures like a Chess knight. Next is a crocodile that can move and capture by stepping one space in any direction or may race all the way to the river on an open file or may swim horizontally within the river along its entire unobstructed length. Next comes an elephant that moves and captures by jumping one or two squares orthogonally. Next is the lion, then another elephant. Next is a monkey that moves by stepping one space in any direction or captures (possibly repeatedly) by jumping over pieces by a short leap (i.e., the monkey's capturing movement is like the piece movement in Halma, but with immediate capture). Last comes the giraffe, which can jump one or two steps in any direction or capture by jumping onto pieces two spaces away in any direction. Like animals on opposing sides are lined up opposite their counterparts.

The second rank on each side is filled with un-promoted pawns that move and capture by stepping one space straight or diagonally forward, and may (but only from across the river) also retreat one or two spaces straight backward without capture. Pawns promote to a super-pawn upon reaching the last rank, and may additionally move and capture one space horizontally or retreat one or two spaces diagonally backward from any space on the board. Any piece except the crocodile may only stay in the river for one turn, after which it drowns if not moved further.

The starting player makes a bid such as Three fours and each successive player must make a bid with the same quantity of a higher digit, or a larger quantity of a lower digit, or challenge.  Once all but one player has challenged, all cards are revealed and the digits bid by the last bidding player are counted.

18817,General de Brigade,1998,7.66667,21,3.5,2,4,180,180,Wargames,Miniatures Napoleonic Wargame ,Simulation,"From the author's website:

General de Brigade Napoleonic wargames rules use infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries as the basic tactical units. The figure scale is 1:20.

Over the years I have used various sets of Napoleonic wargames rules  some good, others too complicated or simply not Napoleonic. Most however, were split into two very separate camps - those aimed at battalion level and those aimed at army level with little or no middle ground between the two. General de Brigade was designed to combine the appeal of battalion based games with the most important aspects of command and control from army level games. It was important therefore to base the game at the correct level within the military structure in order to achieve this. The division seemed the most suitable level.

When players field a division they are in command of a number of brigades and it is to this level that most wargamers are suited. This is because after spending hours researching and painting our armies we want to maneuver each and every unit, overseeing their every volley, melee and morale test, At brigade level this is exactly what is expected of the commander  he would be concerned with deployment, formation and when to fire  here formations such as column or line do matter! However the use of brigades and brigade orders introduces a command and control factor that limits the 'nippy little battalion' syndrome and restricts the wargamer from doing whatever he wants with any unit whenever it suits him.

General de Brigade allows wargamers the freedom to command and maneuver each battalion or squadron but also includes higher command decisions such as brigade objectives, the timing of assaults and the deployment of reserves.

The center of the board shows a map of Central and South America, while around the edge are the spaces you move on.  There are two card decks: one shows the countries you can visit, and the other shows dollar figures, both for buying and selling.  When leaving the USA, you pick a card to see where you're bound and another card to see what your cargo cost you (red number). You roll 1d6 per turn until you arrive at your destination, then draw another dollar card to see what you get for selling your cargo (red number, which are usually higher).  You repeat this process for going home, except you roll 2d6 for movement on the way home (7s means you lose your turn).  Game ends when a player has made five complete round trips - whoever made the most money wins.

Various spaces on the track allow you to move your piece forward, backward or swap with an opponents piece when your piece lands on them.  Also on the track are four extra areas that allow you to advance two of your pieces when one of your pieces successfully lands on a specific space.

Unlike Parcheesi however, you cannot capture other player's pieces.  Opposing pieces can occupy the same space on the board without any penalty.

Components:
- Mounted game board
- 48 cards
- 16 pawns (4 each of red, blue, green and yellow)
- Rules sheet

A war game for 2 or 3 players featuring plastic jets, tanks, hovercraft, helicopters and missile launchers.

After decades of failed economic reform the republics of the former Soviet Union still lie weak and impotent. 
With the ultimately successful, but costly, war on terror behind it the United States is consumed in a wave of isolationism. In a series of daring diplomatic maneuvers and blitzkrieg military offensives the whole of Central Europe is swallowed in a French anschluss.  (ANNEXATION OF CENTRAL EUROPE BY FRANCE)

Britain, its economy wrecked by French trade sanctions, stands alone amidst a conquered continent. The Mediterranean Sea is closed to British commerce. With the Atlantic sea lanes in danger, arrangements are made to build bases on Madeira and the Canary Islands to supplement the British presence in the Azores.

Europe once more finds war thrust upon it!

Based on a theme that attracts all children the Burger Card Game challenges players to construct the biggest Burger of all.

To begin, all the cards are placed face down. To get into the game a player must turn up a bun. Then he goes for a Burger, followed by as many different toppings as possible until another bun comes up, thus ending his turn. But watch out! The moment a duplicate topping is turned up, all the cards go face down again, back into play. The trick is in remembering where everything is. The winner is the player with the most cards at the end of the game.

The goal is to move all three of a player's marbles around the board from base position to home safe. Each player rolls his dice once to determine who plays first. Player rolling the highest number is first and chooses his color, placing the three marbles in base position. Play will proceed to the left, each player choosing his color and placing his three marbles in his base position. With all marbles now in base position, first player rolls his die. Either a one or a six must be rolled to take a marble from base to start location marked by single hole of the player's color. Players roll their die in turn, moving marbles which have been started the exact number of places permitted by number rolled. When a one or a six is rolled, player has choice of moving a started marble that number of spaces or starting a new marble. Also, the rolling of a six entitles that player to an additional turn IF he was able to use the six he just rolled. As play proceeds, a player may not pass or land on a marble of his own color. However, when a player's move lands his marble on a space occupied by another's marble, he may JOLT by replacing that marble with his own. The JOLTED player must then re-start the marble from his base position. Marbles are ALWAYS subject to JOLTING until in safe home. First player with all three marbles safe home is winner of the game.

With that being said (or rather written), sounds like Parchesi revisited...

Players alternate placing 3 triangles of their color, attempting to complete squares in their color, and patterns of completed squares as well. On a single turn they may ONLY complete squares of their color by playing against pieces already on the board.

Which of course means that the game is an instant tie if played symmetrically. (The rules even warn against this.)

This mode is ironically enough called Thinker Style, vs the Gambler Style where each player rolls a die to determine how many pieces they can place. This should eliminate ties, but only by replacing them with a large dose of randomness.

18900,Altar,1987,5,4,2,2,2,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"(Description from the box)

The game of strategy and wit for two players involving thirteen geometric elements and an invisible force.

The geometric shape of the individual playing pieces indicates how they may be moved, while maintaining a simple visual and tactile quality.

The invisible force relies on the imagination of the players. The concept is similar to the repelling forces between two magnets. In the game 'Altar' imaginary repelling forces exist between the different colored playing pieces.

The object of the game is for a player to maneuver the opposing color altar (cube) into the central recess and then to place their own templar (cone) on top of that altar (cube) to win the game.

The three dimensional design of the board incorporates recessed areas. These may only be crossed by the raven (hexagonal shape), which normally requires an obstacle to jump over to complete its move. The other playing pieces may only cross these areas by using an altar piece (cube) as a 'bridge' or 'stepping stone'.

The unique concept which controls and unifies the game enables 'Altar' with relatively few pieces to develop many permutations. Consequently a depth and level comparative to that of 'chess' can evolve with the individual.

In the jumping events there is some decision-making and push-your-luck involved, as players must decide when to jump. They move their pieces according to the die-roll and will have to decide if they are happy with the result or would like to roll once more, of course risking an illegal jump.

Players may either just play to win, or they may wish to know their actual results in meters and seconds. In the latter case, there are some results tables in the rulebook that can be used.

You decide to clean up your rifle and go hunting for a turkey so yer family won't go another holiday season eating Spam sandwiches for the main course.

I believe this was published in the December 2000 issue of Games Unplugged Magazine. The board is printed in the magazine; you provide a few D4's and 2 pawns of the same color for each player (must be able to tell what direction your pawn is facing). The board also has a Buzz Meter for each player (Betty-Jo, Jim-Bob, Tex, Cousin Luke, Uncle Robert and Ma) so you can keep track of how drunk each one is.

Objective: Everyone's pawn on the board represents a drunken hillbilly stumbling through the woods trying to land on the center square of the game board (shooting a turkey). Once you have landed on the square, you then have to move your pawn off the board (bringing the turkey home). First one to do this wins.

There are two phases per turn:

Action phase - Move (you control only distance or direction), Drink a beer (allows you to change your direction) or Sober up (decrease your level of drunkenness on your Buzz Meter). Everyone performs their action before the Shootin' phase.

Shootin' phase - Anything in each player's line of sight (turkey or hillbilly) gets shot automatically. Of course, if you are shot, you guzzle a beer to ease the pain before continuing.

You are out of the game if you get so drunk that you wander off the board. You are the winner if you are the first to shoot a turkey and bring it home OR you are the last player on the board without anyone else having gotten  a turkey.

18916,Polemos: English Civil War,2005,6.5,4,3,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Civil War Miniatures Pike and Shot Wargame ,Simulation,"From the publisher's website:

During the middle years of the seventeenth century, the British Isles underwent a period of huge change, catastrophic wars and campaigns, political revolution, social upheaval political experimentation and religious ferment. It was a period when the famous and the infamous made their entries into the history books leaving their legacy and their legends. Names such as Ralph Hopton, William Waller, Prince Rupert, Thomas Fairfax, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Newcastle, Owen Roe ONeill, The Earl of Montrose and Duke of Argyll can still evoke fierce loyalties and harsh criticism even today. The characters of those chief protagonists, King Charles I and Oliver Cromwell, are still considered, analyzed and argued over by successive generations of historians.

There is little surprise therefore that the English Civil War has always been a firm favorite for wargamers.

Polemos: English Civil War is unashamedly aimed at large scale actions. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions the size of Edgehill, Marston Moor and Naseby in an evening.

The basic playing piece in Polemos is the Base. An army is comprised of a number of Bases and can be built either using historical orders of battle or on Army Lists. Bases are generally grouped into Brigades. Armies can vary in size from around 15 to 50 Bases.

Polemos:ECW is designed to allow the player to represent an English Civil War army using a limited number of bases, each of which represents a tactical element that may act individually. Each base is designed to have enough figures on it to look like a real unit. The design focus eliminates fiddly lining up, precise numbers of figures of musketeers and pikemen etc in favour of a broader approach.

18917,Polemos: War of the Spanish Succession,2005,8,1,0,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Age of Reason Miniatures Wargame ,Simulation,"From the publisher's website:

First of the great dynastic struggles of the eighteenth century, the War of Spanish Succession involved most of Europe. A state which did not back up its policies with troops in this period probably supplied them as mercenaries to those which did.

Central to the causes of conflict were the expansionist ambitions of Louis XIV, King of France, which were opposed by a series of shifting alliances. Towering over the period is the figure of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, and his close ally Prince Eugene of Savoy.

This is the classic campaigning period. Each year, the armies marched across Europe is a colossal chess game on a board constricted by river barriers and studded with fortresses. These manoeuvres culminated in great set-piece battles, including Marlboroughs big four: Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet.

The War of Spanish Succession has much to recommend it to wargamers; uniforms were colourful (but are simple to paint.) and manoeuvres were bold and forceful. Standing armies were in their relative infancy at this time, and the period saw the founding of traditions which were to last the centuries.

Polemos War of Spanish Succession is specifically aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts. For instance, troops using the platoon firing system have improved close range factors, while others using fire by ranks are allowed to be more aggressive.

The basic playing piece in Polemos is the Base. An army consists of a number of bases, organised into Brigades and Commands, either to an historical model or by the use of army lists. The size of armies in this period varied enormously; in Polemos WoSS, a generals command can be from eight to 15 bases, but an army can comprise anything from two commands upwards.

Polemos War of Spanish Succession is designed to not only give the feel of command in the period, but also to give something of the look. The actual number or composition of figures on a base is unimportant, but it should mount enough figures to make it look like a real unit of troops. The sight of your lines of steady musketeers or massed cavalry advancing across the table should fill your opponent with awe and trepidation!

18918,Polemos: Great Northern War,2005,6.8,5,3,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Age of Reason Miniatures Wargame ,Simulation,"From the publisher's website:

The early years of the eighteenth century were a time of great, and long lasting, changes in Eastern Europe. It saw two former Great powers decline; for Sweden it was a cataclysmic experience as they were reduced to a small or medium power. While Poland-Lithuania started on the path that would lead to extinction later in the century. It saw two medium sized powers, Denmark and Saxony, fail in their bid to gain, or regain, Great powers status. It saw two powers rise; for Brandenburg-Prussia it was an important stepping stone to Great power status later in the century. While for Russia went from being an obscure barbarous nation to a Great power thanks to its victories

Polemos: Great Northern War is aimed at gaming large scale actions from this time. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions in an evening and even the largest action should be relatively easy to play. The emphasis is on the Great Northern War but other actions from this period can also be fought. The wars against the Ottoman Empire, the Polish Civil War and other actions in the period 1695 to 1725 may also be fought. You can be Peter the Great of Russia and face the cream of what was probably the best army in the world of this period  Charles XII Swedish army. Perhaps instead you could as Peter battle the Ottomans on the river Prut.

The Great Northern War has perhaps not been gamed as much as would be expected for such an important conflict with many interesting battles and armies. To a large extent this is because of the lack of information about the war and its battles. Polemos: GNW will introduce information and army lists that will rectify this. You too will be able to command the combined Saxon, Polish and Russian army at the battle of Kalisz (1706) or re-fight the Polish civil war battle of Koniecpol (1708).

18923,Malaka,2004,0,0,0,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"Malaka is a cross between Backgammon, Plakoto and Lines of Action.  Players race to move their pieces around the board, delaying their opponent while trying to connect their pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol.  Using a familiar (Backgammon type) roll-and-move mechanism, each player attempts to form an orthogonally connected group of their pieces (as in Lines of Action) at the opposite corner of the board from their starting location.  The board is designed with two walls that force the players to navigate an S type path to reach their goal in the opposite corner.  The board consists of nine subareas, each with a basic direction of forward movement (which is, of course, opposite for the two players).

On their turn, each player rolls two dice (4-sided dice for the 9x9 board, 6-sided dice for the 12x12 board) and uses the resulting numbers to move their pieces.  Pieces may either step directly forwards, or jump over a wall.  If a piece steps directly forwards, then it must step in a straight line a number of spaces equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  If the piece steps onto a single enemy piece, then that enemy piece is pinned (as in Plakoto) until the player moves off.  Players may stack as many pieces as they like onto any point, but cannot move to any point at which the enemy controls a block (a pile of two or more pieces).  Alternatively, a piece may jump over a wall (ignoring the movement restrictions of the moving piece's current sub-area) if that jump lands on a single enemy piece a number of spaces away equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  The enemy piece is captured and removed from the game.  Players cannot jump backwards and cannot cross both walls with the same jump.  Jumping over a wall to capture an enemy piece is a double-edged sword: it allows the piece to push forward quickly by taking a shortcut, but also makes the opponent's task easier as they have one less piece to connect.

After making any move, the same piece may take further steps or jumps, possibly changing direction if the first move resulted in a change in sub-area. If a double is rolled, then the player moves four times using the pip value shown (as in Backgammon).  The player must make a move that uses the maximum possible number of pips.

A player wins by orthogonally connecting all of their remaining pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol (not necessarily in a single connected group, but all pieces orthogonally connected to a piece on the goal line).  A player may also win by pinning an opponent's piece on his own starting line.

Principle of the game : The players must go through the different road sections of the special stage made with special cards put on the table at the beginning of the game. They must read the difficulties of the road and adapt their speed and the orientation of the wheel. To change speed and direction of the wheel, players have cards with points. Players will have to drive over the speed limits (but not too much) to win the race.

End of the game: The game is finished when someone crosses the finish line. The player with the fewest seconds chips is the winner.

This game received a mention spciale du Jury at the 2004 gathering of Boulogne Billancourt for game designers.

This is a 9 turn game on a small map with 10 units per side. Should play quickly. The game has initiative, disruption, counterattacks, event chits (which modify a rule or condition). Victory is determined by comparing (at the end of the game) the randomly drawn Victory Chit (by the Union player) with the status at the end of the game. The Confederate player does not know what goal the Union player has. The CRT is relatively bloodless, but you accumulate Disruption Markers which represent losses and reduced combat/maneuver abilities (sort of a step loss system).

4 3X3 interlocking board pieces
24 Janken (Rock, Scissors, Paper) pieces in orange and blue
1 bag

Janken Plus is a production of Gakken, an educational publishing company in Japan, in the Embrain Goods line. The games are touted as being good for the brain.

There are at least four different games you can play with the Janken Plus set, though not all of them are Rock-Scissors-Paper games.

1. Janken Game: Because the four boards are interlocking, they can be arranged differently, as a 6X6 square (basic game using all 24 janken pieces), or other arrangements with games for 12 pieces.

The pieces can be moved in any direction, any number of squares. Pieces are taken in the traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock way. The game ends when one player has only two pieces left. On the box it says it's a similar game to Shogi.

2. Play-off Janken: Each player places their pieces face down; they can arrange the pieces as they like. The board isnt used. They each choose one piece and play janken. The winner is the player who captures the most of their opponents pieces. (This is not a thinking game.)

3. Tic-Tac-Toe variant: Using one board, the players play a Tic-Tac-Toe game aiming to get three pieces in a row. Once a player has played three pieces, he or she can only move them on the board. A variant is to use two or more unconnected boards and more pieces, with the ability to move pieces from board to board.

4. Pinch-pon: Players use six pieces each on the 6X6 board. They capture their opponents pieces by sandwiching them between two of their own (as in the ancient game of Hnefatafl and similar games).

Each player is randomly assigned one of twenty 'itineraries', listing the six cities of the world they must visit in any order before returning to New York - the first player to reach New York after touching all cities on his/her itinerary wins.

Travel is handled by a roll of a die which determines which of five travel decks (Walk, Car, Train, Ship, Plane) the player must draw from and execute - most cards dictate a number of kilometers that the player may move (subject to terrain - ships travel by sea, trains/cars/walk by land).  The player drives a pushpin into the map at his/her destination and wraps a like-coloured thread around it - so as the game progresses, a crisscrossing network of coloured pushpins and thread show the paths that each player has traveled.

19013,Tommy Guns Blazing,1993,0,0,0,2,12,60,60,,Fighting Mafia Miniatures Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"Tommy Guns Blazing is a miniatures game (using the Matrix system) set in the 1920s (Prohibition in the USA).  Players take on the role of rival gang members and try to gain control of the illegal speakeasies.  Players must provide their own equipment (dice, map or miniature buildings, counters or miniature figures, etc.).  The game consists of a single 8-page rulebook, including two pages of tables.

The game requires a referee to assess the difficulty of any proposed action.  Success is stated in a number of 6s.  An easy task may require only one 6 to be rolled, but a difficult one might require six 6s.  Likewise, movement is 2 per 6 rolled, and combat is also resolved comparing 6s rolled.

As in most Matrix games, the player chooses how many dice to roll at any given time, which can vary at his whim.  For an easy task, a player may opt to roll only one die, or two dice, or a dozen.  The catch is that while 6s succeed, every 1 that is rolled causes something bad to happen to the character of the die roller!  The more 1s you roll, the worse it gets.

Players control either the British, French, Spanish or American fleets.  Players must provide their own equipment (dice, map with squares, counters or miniature ships, etc.).  The game consists of a single 16-page rulebook, including a few pages of tables.

The game requires a referee to assess the difficulty of any proposed action.  Success is stated in a number of 6s.  An easy task may require only one 6 to be rolled, but a difficult one might require six 6s.  Likewise, movement is 1 as a base, but can be more depending on the number of 6s rolled, how the ship handles in general, and ship's angle to the wind.  Combat is also resolved comparing 6s rolled.

Before the game, every ship has a record sheet and must be rated for Handling, Hull (ability to take damage), Crew Combat Quality, Crew Morale, and Crew Damage Control.

19015,Dragon Wars,1997,3.5,4,1,2,10,30,30,,Card Game Fantasy Fighting ,,"Dragon Wars is a card game included in the RPG aid, Dragonlance Saga Fate Deck.  While the main purpose of the Fate Deck is to play an RPG using the Saga system, the deck includes rules for a stand-alone card game, Dragon Wars.  The RPG rules included in the game are credited to Steven Brown, Steve Miller, and Ed Stark, but no designer is mentioned for Dragon Wars.

The deck consists of 82 cards: eight suits numbered 1-9 and one suit (dragons) numbered 1-10.  To play, the dragons are removed from the deck and shuffled.  Every player gets one dragon.  The remaining 72 cards are shuffled and six are dealt to each player.

Three of the suits are attacking suits, three are defending suits, and two suits may be used for either.  On your turn, you attack a dragon of your choice (but not your own!) by playing attack cards.  The owner responds by playing defense cards.  The attacker may continue the attack if he has more of the same suit he started with.  If he does, the defender may defend with any defensive suit.  Once the attacker calls a halt, subtract defense cards from attack cards.  If the number is positive, the dragon takes that many hits.  (Each dragon has a number of hit points equal to the number on the card.)  Dead dragons are placed in the attacking player's victory point pile, and the defender draws a new dragon to defend, if there are any left.

Rules are provided for despoilers - players whose last dragon is removed after the dragon deck has run out.  (In a ten-player game, that's always!)  The game ends one round after there is only one dragon left in play: everyone else has one turn to try to defeat it.  The numbers on the dragon cards are VP.

At the end of the game, players form Duchies out of the territory they've conquered to score points.  Bonuses are earned by forming Duchies that have one of each Unit, one of each land type, or both.  In addition, proximity to the center of the board is rewarded by an additional bonus.  The player who forms the most valuable Duchies earns the most points and therefore wins!

The game consists of two phases, internal affairs and battles. Both economy and battles are affected greatly by the ability of staffs and generals. And the key to success is to strategically allocate proper subordinates to best provinces.

There are 129 characters in the Three Kingdoms and 40 castles on the map. The tactics cards are based on Sun Tzu's Art of War and other ancient books. The miniature armies are made of metal. Different scenarios are planned to be available on the web.

Dog Fight very closely approaches an actual combat between fighting planes, bombers and anti-aircraft guns. The play takes place on a vertical board which allows the important consideration of altitude to become a part of the play. The planes against the sunset sky make a most realistic picture.

By making use of the allowable moves of the planes and of the spinner which controls 'Hits' it is the purpose of each contestant to silence the anti-aircraft fire of his opponents and to disable and put out of play his opponent's aircraft. Players accomplish this by obtaining proper position with their planes and diving on or shooting down opponents and bombing anti-aircraft guns.

The game board is a vertical piece of cardboard in which the wings of miniature aircraft are inserted to give a feel of the current layout of aircraft.

Fire is resolved by rolling a handful of dice, counting the hits and then subtracting the target's armor - units may be stunned, forced to retreat, take losses or be killed outright.  The advanced rules add a sort of opportunity fire where a unit may interfere with enemy movement by declaring it as a target (provided the enemy is within a certain distance).

19050,Tactics,1940,0,0,0,2,4,60,60,Wargames,Economic Political Wargame ,Secret Unit Deployment,"From the rules:

Not a war game but a game of world strategy.

TACTICS duplicates actual world conditions today.  It places the player in the position of the head of some neutral or belligerent country and lets him use his own judgment as to how present international problems should be met and overcome.

TACTICS may be played by two belligerents, or by two belligerents and one or both neutrals.

The object for belligerents is to blockade opponent belligerent's SEAPORT and for neutrals to trade for profit.  Blockade is accomplished when a belligerent's SEAPORT is completely cut off from the sea.  Trade is accomplished when a SUPPLY SHIP is moved into another player's port.

Neutrals accumulate victory points through trade, but may be attacked by belligerents, which allows them to play a diplomatic protest card. If a third protest card is accepted (they can be dodged by paying a gold), then that neutral joins the war against the offending nation. Neutrals may try to provoke attacks in order to pile on and share the war loot with the victorious belligerent.

War is a game of manoeuver: battleships kill transports easily, but killing a battleship requires getting two friendly battleships on opposite sides of the target. Each nation has two planes, but these only come into play through chance cards, as do submarines (each of which lurks in a particular square of the board and kills an enemy ship that moves onto the square).

19053,Mortality,2004,1,1,0,2,5,0,0,,Religious ,Roll / Spin and Move,"From the publisher:

Mortality is an uplifting LDS board game about life rather than strictly a church game. It isn't made to teach a list of facts about the gospel. Instead, gospel principles are woven into the very fabric of the game. It doesn't give any advantage to the scriptorians or historians. Succeeding at the game requires cooperation, caring for other players, knowing how to build a solid foundation in one's youth, and an understanding of how faith and testimony help you endure trials, and any player who approaches the game in this manner can win.

The game is great at fostering friendly interaction among the players. Even the losers enjoy it, because they tend to end up being the focus of charitable efforts by the other players. Succeeding at the game requires strategy, luck, and advance planning. It teaches LDS values, including the importance of building a foundation that will withstand the adversities of life, the value that hardships can have in building testimony, and the benefits of selfless service. Yes, there is competition in Mortality, because there is a winner, and that's a big part of the entertainment value. But a great part of the fun is in the joking that surrounds the dealing together with experiences and trials in the game that are so much a part of life, but are presented in a somewhat humorous way.

Mortality takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half to play, depending on the experience and luck of the players. It requires a minimum of three players and up to six can play. Young children can be helped to play the game, but truly understanding it requires an age of at least eight.

You start the game in the childhood section. Here you gain points or Testimonies as they are called, strictly by chance, based on what your family does. From there you enter the youth section. As a youth, you begin making decisions on your own that can help you later on or be a detriment to your later progress. You can serve as an LDS missionary, go on dates, and either get a civil marriage or a temple marriage. Avoiding a civil marriage may require some careful advance planning in order to avoid landing on the civil marriage square. From there you move into the adult section. One player gets to be the bishop. This assignment may pass from player to player depending on what happens in the game. As you move around in the adult section, you encounter trials of faith. Depending on how many Testimonies you already have, these trials can hurt you or help you. You also have an opportunity to help other players, for which you will gain even more Testimonies.

Players bid for the right to build stories of buildings on different blocks.  However, in a manner very reminiscent of Othello, when you build in two different blocks, you also get to add a floor of your color to any building in between.  When the game ends, the player who owns the top floor of the building scores all of the points.  The components are mostly wood, and of good quality, but this is clearly a scratch-built game.

19058,Project A-KO Fighter,1995,3,1,0,2,2,30,30,,Card Game Fighting Humor Movies / TV / Radio theme Science Fiction ,Role PlayingStorytellingVariable Player Powers,"Based upon the Japanese anime Project A-Ko, the game tries to re-create the endless battles between A-Ko and B-Ko for the friendship of C-Ko.

Project A-KO fighter is a card game based upon the mechanics found in the card game Heavy Gear fighter and Video fighter. The games are even compatible with one another.

This particular game is made of 36 different playing cards that were included in the Project A-Ko: The Roleplaying game book. Included in the roleplaying book were two different character sheets (one for B-KO and one for A-KO), that needed to be photocopied in order to keep track of the progress of players during the game. Their number of action points left, their remaining health, etc. as well as being used as a reference sheet for the various special powers each character had.

The game was meant as a stand-alone card-game that could also be played within the boundaries of the role-playing game as a player's aid for the game. Players were encouraged to describe verbally how exactly their characters attacked the other using a particular card. It provided those players that described the action behind a card play with special bonuses to their character's statistics, such as increased delivered damage to their opponent.

Also included in the book were various other characters that could be used against B-Ko and A-Ko, such as ordinary persons, tanks, mechas and spaceships, which could bring the game to more than 2 players (to an infinite number if needed), although no character-ready sheets was made available for them in the RPG book.

Four games can be played with this set.

Cardchess: Players shuffle the 16 cards of their suit and place them randomly face down in eight pairs of two on the letters A, R, D, C, H, E, S and S. Each player has two moves each turn. They first turn over a card. Second, they pick any face up card and move it according to chess rules. To win the game, a player must capture all of his opponents' Kings by checkmate. Once a King is captured, all the pieces from his team are removed from the board.

Positional Cardchess: The only difference between Cardchess and Positional Cardchess is the initial setup. In Positional Cardchess, the eight cards of highest value are placed face down on letters A, R, D, C, H, E, S and S in the same order as traditional chess.

Memory Cardchess: All player cards are shuffled together and placed face down on the board in a configuration which depends on the number of players. On each turn, players have two moves. They first turn over a card. The card remains face up if it is in their suit. If it isn't, the card must be clearly shown to other players so they can memorize it. Second, players move the card they just turned over or any other previously exposed card according to chess rules. To win the game, a player must capture all of his opponents' Kings by checkmate.

Traditional chess: The game board and cards allow to play a traditional game of chess.

This series gives a detailed tactical-operational treatment to several battles of the civil conflict. The level of detail is high for aspects such as supply, combat or organic organization of divisions/army corps, but the system always uses mechanisms as simple and intuitive as possible.

The objective with this series was to give the Spanish Civil War a specific treatment. Until then, what most designers in Spain and abroad did to simulate SCW battles was simply to adapt systems designed for WW2 games. No Pasarn! is a system specifically designed to show the peculiar features and differences of the civil war with respect to other conflicts, especially the First and Second World Wars.

The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may go for a wedge by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.

19118,"Grey Storm, Red Steel",1995,8.33333,3,0,2,2,2,2,Wargames,Miniatures Wargame World War II ,Simulation,"Grey Storm, Red Steel is a set of miniatures rules for small-unit tactical combat on the Eastern Front in World War 2. The scale of the game is a 1:1 representation of men and equipment. Time scale is one game turn equals 2 and a half minutes; ground scale is 1 inch equals 10 meters. The miniatures are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle teams (3-4 figures), light machine gun teams (2 figures), leaders (1 figure) and weapons teams (2-4 figures depending on the weapon). Tanks and vehicles are mounted singly. Infantry units are made up of two or more rifle teams and zero to two light machine gun teams.

The rules work very well for representing actions on a platoon or company scale. The rules are best for infantry actions. The rules for tanks are not very detailed: one die roll to see if a hit is made, another for the result based on a comparison of the penetrative ability of gun firing with the overall armor quality of the target. However, they tend to give as good an end result as more complex rules. Anti-tank weapons range from the PzB38/39 and PTRD AT rifles to massive 128mm and 152mm AT guns.

GSRS provides rules for hidden set up, pre-battle recon, weather, command control, and target location that can be used to make challenging game scenarios. There are also some chrome rules for things like Panzer Aces, Heroes of the Soviet Union, and civilians in the combat zone. The rules also cover the use of cavalry and air support.

The rules includes a lot of information about unit organization, AFV data, and aircraft data. There is also a section detailing the differences between Soviet and German tactics and capabilities.

GSRS is a somewhat obscure and underrated set of miniatures rules that provides a great deal of flavor and compares very well to tactical boardgames like Squad Leader, ASL, and the Advanced Tobruk (ATS) series.

This rules system is ideal for the beginning miniatures wargamer.  The rulebook is only 6x9 in size with the text printed in single column to a page.  They are concise an easy to understand while still modeling the effects of warfare accurately.

The only thing the rules are a little thin on is command and control.  The system assumes that all units activate orders automatically.  However, this is a good thing for beginning wargamers (less to think about your first time out!).  You can always add your own CC rules.

GDW also included a 6x9 organization book and charts in their boxed set.  These detailed the organization, quality, capabilities, and how to mount the figures for each unit that fought in Europe during the Napoleonic era.  Again, this makes the system easier for the beginner to learn as they don't have to do a lot of research.

Fire and Steel regulates the size of bases and terrain on a pure ground scale.  The board played on depicts terrain at a ground scale of 1 = 25 yds.  The size of the minis bases are dependent on how much frontage the unit occupied, not abstracted like other minis games.

Also see GDW's sister rules set called System 7 Napoleonics.  For the most part, the two rules sets are identical.  Really, the only difference between the two is the System 7 rules allow counters to replace miniatures.

WTF is, on the surface, a game about cards and points.  You play a card, you gain or lose some points, and the player with the most points when the GAME OVER card is played wins. But there's a catch or two: First, the GAME OVER card is double-sided, so everyone knows where it is at all times.  Second, over half of the cards in WTF contain blanks and you get to fill them in and finish the rules!  You might get a card that lets you determine how many points players gain or lose, or you might get a card that lets you require all players to perform some ridiculous task of your choosing.  Each card simply must follow on the suit of the previous card -- but many of the suits are made up by the players as they play! The big catch is that you actually write on the cards each game, so your deck is always changing.  The result is that the card that seemed funny when it made the player to your left eat his own earwax is a lot less funny when it comes back around to the player on your right!  For even more excitement, you can mix up your deck with another friend's deck and see what happens. Its up to everyone to decide how far you have to go to get points and keep the GAME OVER card out of the point leaders hand.

Goal: To form a lattice of interlocking meme (a unit of cultural information that can be transmitted from one mind to another) strings.

You Need:


     A set of BAG tiles. You can download, print, and cut apart our starter BAG tile set . We strongly recommend creating your own set or customizing the starter set. Just glue snippets from magazines onto the backs of the starter set tiles and trim the clipping to fit the tile.
     A bag or other opaque container to put the BAG tiles in.
     A flat surface to play on. 


Each player draws seven tiles from the bag. On your turn, try to find a theme or concept that two or more of them share. One youve found a theme for one or more of your tiles, lay them in the play area. If tiles are already in play, the tiles you play must intersect one or more of them.

Draw one tile for every tile you played. Score one point for every tile in each meme-string you added to or created. Play passes to the left.

The first player with 21 points wins.

You think road construction is bad in your town? You should try living in Austin. Even without road construction, the signage is confusing and the drivers are absolutely nuts. The only thing that could make navigating the city more challenging is if the roads actually shifted and changed while youre driving.

Object: Get from your home to the capitol building in the middle of town without getting captured by the dillo hunter.

You Need:


     Two 6-sided dice.
     A city map. (provided on the website)
     Road pieces. (provided on the website)
     An opaque bag or other container.
     five pawns of different shapes or colors  one for each dillo and one for the Dillo Hunter. 


On your turn, roll two dice. If you roll doubles, the player to your left moves the Dillo Hunter the amount shown on one die. If a pawn enters a space occupied by a stop sign, it must stop moving. After the Dillo Hunter moves (if it moves), choose one of the dice you rolled. Look up that number on the Action Chart (Twist, Swap, Push, or a combination of these) and take the action indicated by your chosen roll.

If you land on the capitol in the center of the board, you win the game.

Give each player two cards from each suit. The rank of the cards does not matter. Sort the cards in your hand so that no card is adjacent to a card of the same suit. On your turn you can shift (move one or two cards from one end of your hand to the other) or swipe (ask any player, 'Do you have any {name a suit}?' If your target has that suit at either end of his or her hand, he or she must give it to you).

If you have four consecutive pairs of suits in your hand at the end of your turn, you win.

Object: To guess words chosen by the other players from a fairy tale while keeping yours secret.

You Need: Pencil and paper for each player

Once everyone has pencils, paper, and magic beans, choose a fairy tale for the game. Once a fairy tale has been selected, each player needs to write down five words commonly associated with that tale.

The object of the game is to get the other players to say their secret words by asking questions and through general conversation. Once the game has started, you must not speak your own secret words.

On your turn, pick a person and ask him a question about the story. He has to answer it. Remember, not only is your subject not allowed to use his or her secret words, but you arent allowed to use your secret words either.

At the beginning of your turn, you may instead pass your turn. If all of the players in the game but one pass their turns in one round, then the game ends.

At the end of the game, jot down what you think each players secret words are. Take turns declaring your secret word guesses. Score one point for every correct guess. Score a point for every one of your secret words that no other player guessed. The player with the highest score wins.

Its time to figure out what the aliens put in your brain, confront it, and get it out of there. Remember, today is the first day of the rest of your life.

Object: To figure out what your abduction-induced phobias are, have them treated, and regain your sanity.

You Need: Alien abduction requires no paper or props, just dark nights on lonely moonlit roads, and victims.

Alien Abduction is a new spin on Twenty Questions. One player is the Abductee, and the other players are Aliens. If youre an Alien, secretly choose a phobia for the Abductee. The Abductee goes through their 'day', trying to figure out what phobias he now has because of his abduction.

19158,Havok Skirmish Battle Set,1997,5.57143,14,2,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Miniatures Science Fiction Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"The Havok Skirmish Battle Set was a starter set for the short-run miniature war game Havok produced by Bluebird Toys in 1997. As well as this base set additional units  even vehicles were also available in non-random booster packs.

The Havok Miniatures Game was intended to fill a gap in the market by posing as a cheap alternative to Warhammer 40,000. Unfortunately bad marketing and Bluebird Toys' financial shut-down cost the game dearly, and the line (along with the Bluebird Toys company) folded by Christmas 1997.

Initially sold exclusively through Argos stores, all the unit boosters had a single item code meaning customers could not purchase the specific unit boosters they desired (Argos would pick from the boosters 'at random'). At the end of the line remaining Havok boosters were sold in bulk to toy suppliers where they proved surprisingly popular, but it was already too late for the game and many new fans didn't initially realise that the game was already discontinued.

The game itself can be compared to a lighter, more simplistic version of Warhammer 40,000. Two or more players pick forces from three possible factions of the Havok sci-fi universe using a point system, and then battle it out across the tabletop.

In the game's favour the models were made of from durable plastic, pre-painted and simply slotted into their bases which were decorated with simple stickers, meaning there was no modelling or painting required.

The Havok Skirmish Battle Set included everything you needed to play, including a small fixed selection of miniatures, custom dice, range rulers and instructions, as well as four pieces of slot together scenery.

The Viet Cong D445 Local Force Battalion had dominance in this area but the Australians were increasing their activity.

The local Viet Cong commander, Colonel Nguyen Than Hong, aimed to make a large attack on 6th Bn causing a politically unacceptable loss, hoping to cause its withdrawal. The Viet Cong 275 Regiment moved south intending to attack. The VC continually formed assault waves and moved forward but were decimated by artillery fire. The soldiers of D Company showed excellent discipline holding their line and repulsing any VC that got through the artillery barrage. D Company were supported by 24 105mm and 155mm guns from Australian, New Zealand artillery units and the US 2/35 Battalion, which fired deeper into VC positions.

Beyond that, each team version of the game was identical.

The game uses a board very similar to a Monopoly board.  Each team has a square and there are several special squares (Interception, Touchdown, Super Bowl, Kickoff, and Penalty) that each have specific rules as to how they affect the game.

Each turn in the game represents a football play  After the player rolls the dice and moves their helmet, they draw a play card (team space and super bowl space) or penalty card (penalty space) or they score (touchdown space).  There are also special rules for 4th downs, field goals, punts (and returns), kickoffs (and returns), fumbles, and safeties.

The game goes for 4 quarters, each consisting of 25 play cards.  After all of the play cards are exhausted, the game is over, and the player with the most points wins.

Lovers Wild is a fun spoof of sexual morality today. As a player you have been invited to a wild party along with twelve naughty but nice characters. The object of play is for you to score as many seductions as possible.

The board is set up as a modest movie star type estate with various rooms. Bedroom, den, kitchen, etc, with an outside garden, pool, and entrance way. The objective of the game is to move various characters about from room to room, with the intent of gathering as many together in a room as possible. You must have the characters and the room card to score points. So as you move a character towards a room to have a group seduction with other character cards you have in hand, another player may have the same character card, and wishes this character to have a seduction with the players they are gathering in a different part/room of the estate. The more people you can gather in a room together the more points you score. There are optional rules that allow for gay seductions. Like Ticket to ride, the longer the track built the more points, in Lovers Wild the more characters in a room having a seduction, the more points. Multiples of characters must be as equal as possible, if 5 people in a room are having a seduction, 2 or 3 must be women, one woman and four men does not make an seduction or scoring hand. Fast moving game, lay your hand for points if you can, draw a card, move a character. The more players the more difficult larger seductions are. The board in nicely done, and character chits are humorous with a variety of people types, that fits well in with game, with names like Hands a Roaming, Lucy Love Lace, Dolly Pardon. This may be another game lost to the gaming world, where even the author could not put me onto a replacement copy.

19240,Imperial Infantry Squad,1982,5.55556,9,3,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Science Fiction Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Imperial Infantry Squad is a tactical-level wargame of combat in the distant future after man has reached the stars. It can best be described as Squad Leader meets Star Wars meets Starship Troopers.

The unit counters represent infantry squads, individual leaders. and support weapons. The support weapons consist of  light, medium, and heavy energy weapons and demolition packs. Infantry types are bit different than your typical grunt. Types include light, heavy, and powered infantry that can fly using rocket packs. There are three forces represented by the counters: Confederation Infantry (the earthlings), Mercenaries (non-Confederation humanoids), and Telzans (lizard like aliens).

The game mechanics are mostly simplified versions of Squad Leader's mechanics with a few alterations as well as the additional nuances required for the futuristic infantry types and aliens.

The game mapsheets are geomorphic to accommodate the various scenarios that are included.

The production quality of the game is not bad, but not up to the better games of the same era (like Squad Leader). Although it's highly (if not shamelessly) derivative, Imperial Infantry Squad a decent tactical-level sci-fi wargame.

One player takes the human side and defends the entire map against the other, who takes the invading X-Con (aliens, clones, and robots).

The game appears to be a reasonably straightforward wargame of its type, complicated by a fairly wide variety of different unit types and the rules writer, who adopted what I have to assume was a deliberately obtuse style.  For example, the combat phase (with its 8 sub-phases) is called Violent Interaction  Adaptive Reaction.  The space combat results table is called the Space Systematized Probabilistic Outcome.  Etc.

There is a fair amount of chrome, including secret weapons for each side (e.g., the humans can get a planetary defense screen, the aliens can get a space creature which moves around and eats human units).

Short rules summary:
The board is made up of circles resembling positions a footballist can take on the field. The circles are connected by lines which the footballists and the ball may travel along.
Each turn, both player rolls a die, and divides the result between his footballists. For each point a footballist may be moved to an adjacent circle. After that, the ball must be moved the same total amount of spaces. Unlike footballists, it can only change direction if it hits a freindly footballist. The ball's required movement may force the player to give the ball to the opposing team. 
In addition to that, the ball goes to the opposing team anytime a 1 or 6 is rolled.

Has some similarities to Street Soccer, but predates that title by many years.

19263,Dead & Breakfast,2000,5.9,5,1.6667,3,6,45,60,,Card Game Horror ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"Dead  Breakfast - A Spooky Game for 3 - 6 Players

Your Goal: To Scare the Bejeezus Out of Tourists in a Haunted Bed and Breakfast

Published in the October 2000 Issue of Dragon Magazine (#276). The pull-out board depicts a the 6 rooms of a Bed  Breakfast. Every card of a standard 52-card deck is represented by one of the spaces on the board.

Also needed: 8 D6 (including 6 of different colors for the guests of the BB), plus 2 white dice for rolling; a score pad and pencil; about 30 chips in a unique color for each player; a standard deck of cards without jokers.

The 6 colored dice represent the guests, with the number showing representing their level of agitation (each starts at 2, mildly spooked). Each chip represents a ghost that can haunt a room on the board. Different ghosts belong to different players, which is why each player needs their own color of chips.

Play: 
--Draw your hand up to 5 cards.
--Play a card and 'haunt' the room containing the card you played. To haunt a room, place a chip of your color on the top of the stack of chips in that room (unless a chip of your color is on the top of the stack), or begin a stack if none exists. You also haunt adjacent rooms that are already haunted (have chips of any color in the room).
--Move one guest according to the roll of 2 D6

When a guest lands in a haunted room, points are awarded to the ghosts in that room. Points (equal to the guest's spook level - number on the guest's die) are distributed among the ghosts in that room, with more points going to the top ghost.

If a guest stops in a room that is not yet haunted, the player (if any) holding the card for that room can play the card and 'surprise' the guest, scoring points for scaring that guest.

Each time the a guest lands on a numbered room, their rank (number on die) is increased by 1. If the guest is a 6, they 'freak out'. Freaked-out guests are worth negative points.

Play ends when the last card is played. Player with the most points wins.

A few variants are also included in the rules.

Object: To end the game with the most points in symbiotic pairs and royal symbiotes, ideally while hosting the symbiote. Keeping control of the Symbiote makes it easier to gather royal and paired symbiotes.

You Need:

* A poker deck.
    * A double-sided symbiote / parasite marker, like a CD-R from a failed burn.

Players try to make symbiotic pairs (a pair of cards that adds up to 10) or royal symbiotes (a Jack, Queen, and King.) If a player has the symbiote in front of them on his turn, he can draw additional cards. Tens can be used to change the symbiote into a parasite, which will hinder the player who has it.

The game ends when there are no cards in the draw pile at the start of a player's turn. Flip all of your symbiotic pairs and royal symbiotes face-up and add up their values. If you end the game with the symbiote, score an additional point for every symbiotic pair or royal symbiote you have. If you end the game with a parasite, then lose one point for every symbiotic pair or royal symbiote you have.

The player with the highest score wins. Ties go to the player with the symbiote (or without the parasite).

19271,Glutter of Ravens: Warfare in the Age of Arthur,1998,6.85,10,3,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Medieval Miniatures Wargame ,Simulation,"Rules and resources for wargames in the period AD400-AD700.

The name comes from a line in the Welsh epic Y Gododdin, He glutted black ravens on the walls of the fort, but he was no Arthur.

Daniel Mersey, the designer, is a British archaeologist who wanted a set of miniature wargame rules that specifically captured the style of warfare in Dark Ages Britain in the period between the Roman departure and the coming of the Vikings; the age that was dominated by the legendary war-leader Arthur.

The armies represented in the rules are mostly the British kingdoms that arose after the Romans left Britannia. However, there are also the external enemies of these kingdoms: the Irish, the Picts, and the Saxons. There is also an army list for Romans.

Figures are mounted in multiples on stands that represent warbands. Warband types can be Heavy Cavalry (HC), Light Cavalry (LC), Heavy Infantry (HI), and Light Infantry (LI). The warbands are further distinguished by a set of three characteristics that play an important role in movement and combat. These characteristics are Formation, Aggression, and Strength and are represented by a numerical value that can fluctuate during the game. Based on warband type and nationality or kingdom, there are set maximums for each of these characteristics. If the value for any one characteristic decreases to zero, the warband is lost.

Players control their armies through Command Points that are determined by a die roll. Using his Command Points, a player can move his warbands or increase their Formation and Aggression values up to the maximum allowed. (The Strength characteristic represents the number of warriors in the warband. Once a Strength point is lost, it stays lost.)

Armies are divided into two distinct categories of warband. The Comitatus represents the personal retinue of the leader, the trained warriors whose only job is to be fighters. The Contingent represents levy troops who are not primarily warriors but can be pressed into service to swell the numbers of an army. The maximum Formation and Aggression values for the Comitatus are higher than those for the Contingent.

When choosing the warbands that make up his army, a player must use all the Comitatus warbands in his army list (there are always five). However, he may choose any number of the Contingent warbands from none to all. The number of warbands in the army is a critical pre-game decision a player must make. The starting values for Formation and Aggression are assigned to the warbands from a pool of 30 Command Points that a player starts with. Even if he chooses only the Comitatus, he will likely be unable to start with his warbands at maximum values and must build them up during the game using his Command Points. This building up of the warbands represents the need for a leader to organize and inspire his warriors for them to be at their maximum effectiveness in battle. If a player divides his 30 Command Points between too many warbands, the starting values will be very low and he must spend several turns building up his warbands.

Combat is divided between missile file and melee. Every warband has some kind of missile weapon (javelins, slings, bows). Firing is done by comparing a firing warband's Strength to the target's modified die roll. If the die roll is lower than the firing unit's Strength, some effect is made against the target.

The values that warbands use for melee depends on the nature of contact: warbands that move into combat use their Aggression value, warbands who are stationary when contacted use their Formation value, and warbands that are continuing a melee (no initial contact this turn) use their Strength--the combat has degenerated to a slog bewteen mobs of armed men.

As a result of combat, warbands may Stand, Rally Back, or Retreat in addition to varying losses in Formation, Aggression, and Strength. A very successful warband may actually increase Aggression as a result of combat. Warbands are never eliminated outright in combat unless their losses reduce one of their characteristics to zero. In many cases, a warband has to get hammered for several rounds of melee before it is lost.

Glutter of Ravens is based on the Dark Age Infantry Slog concept that was featured in a volume of Wargames Illustrated magazine. The rules also seem to borrow from the De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA) rules from WRG. However, the nuances in the rules create enough distinction that you get the feel you are not simply playing a version of DBA.

The rules also contain a great deal of background information about the period that include notes about the armies of the era, color plates of warriors of the period, a very good bibliography, and a presentation of the debate, Arthur: Fact or Fiction?

Cordite and Steel is very much a simulation. Even though the mechanics are pretty straightforward (there are only 14 pages of actual rules), there is a great amount of adjudication needed for every shot taken.

Players use range estimation and plot their shots by target, distance, number of shots, and spread. Factors such as the hieght of the firing ship's gun platform from sea level and a target factor based on the target ship's size are cross-referenced with the range to determine the Danger Space that extends beyond the ship model. All shots that are estimated to fall within the Danger Space are considered hits. The location of hits is determined from the Hit Probability Table and Armor chart that is unique to every ship. After this, penetration, damage, and critical hits are determined. The whole process for a single shot can be lengthy. Games that involve several model ships can take a very long time to adjudicate all the shots in any one game turn.

The rules recommend that judges be used in the game in order to adjudicate the shots and record damage that only the player commanding the ship can see. Because of the time involved in this, the rules also recommend that an area be set aside for the players commanding the ships to play other games (like Monopoly) while waiting for the results of the firing to be determined.

The area needed for play can be quite large. Gun ranges at 1:2400 scale can go up to 30 feet. Something like a gymnasium floor is the best place to play if you plan on a large fleet action like Dogger Bank or Jutland.

For small actions, like the SMS Emden vs. the HMAS Sydney, these rules can be very good becasue the detail makes the individual action more exciting. However, the rules don't work for actions that are larger than Coronel or The Falklands.

Despite its claim to cover the period from 1890 to 1920, Cordite and Steel is solely dedicated to naval combat in World War One. The only ship cards and Danger Space Tables supplied are for German and British WWI ships and guns. It would be very difficult to expand the game to other eras because of the intense amount of research needed to create ship cards and gun tables for other navies and wars.

19291,Redcoat,1976,7.5,2,0,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Age of Reason American Revolutionary War Miniatures Wargame ,Area MovementSimulation,"The Bicentennial Wargame

Redcoat was unique for its time in that it was designed to be a campaign game where the battles are fought out using miniatures. The game includes three booklets: Campaign Game, Miniatures Game, and Historical Analysis.

The Campaign Game is played on a map of the American colonies that is divided into regions. Each region is worth a number of victory points for the British player if they hold it. Holding a region requires a garrison whose size varies by region. For example, Massachussetts Bay requires a garrison of 4000 men; the Mohawk Valley requires a garrison of only 500 men. Regions also provide a number of Loyalists that can be recruited as Provincial units in the British army, Militia who fight as partisans against the British, and a variable number of Continental Army recruits.

Movement in the campaign is by area (Region). Americans move pretty freely, but the British forces can have some difficulty getting around. This represents the fact that the British found it hard to get their armies where they wanted them when they wanted them (for example, Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne's miserable time in upper New York in 1777). As the British move through areas, they trigger the arrival of loyalists and militia.

Campaign years are divided into four seasons (turns). The fourth season is winter, which prohibits any British units from moving while allowing American forces to move at a lower rate. However, winter also causes winter attrition among American Continental units.

American forces are created through Continental recruitment and militia (who appear as a result of British being in an area). British forces, except for Provincial units, arrive (and leave) according to their historical schedules. The French may intervene depending on whether the Americans can win a Major Victory.

Winning the campaign game for the British requires a long, slow haul of hanging on to sufficient regions (which generate victory points) from 1775 to 1783. Americans win the campaign game by winning Major Victories over the British or by holding out and denying the British their victory conditions.

The rules for the Miniatures Game are pretty standard for 1976, but compare very well to many current rules. The ground scale is 1 equals 15 yards. Time scale is 1 turn equals 15 minutes. Figure scale is variable; regulars are 1:30 while milita and Indians are 1:50.

The size of the playing area depends on the number of combatants in the campaign battle. The terrain set up for a battle depends on the size of the playing area and the Terrain Factor of the region where the battle is located. The defending player places the terrain in the playing area and the attacking player chooses which edge of the playing area he will deploy on.

Morale plays a large part in the game. British units tend to be very good, while American units are mostly average to poor. Battles can be a challenge for the Americans, but they can rely on their strengths in skirmishing and shooting--and avoiding British bayonet charges.

Leaders play a significant role in the game and are specified as Class I and Class II, who are named individuals, and Class III, who represent generic leaders. The rules offer ratings for different historical generals (Benedict Arnold is only rated once as an American).

Without being difficult, the rules add some nuances that bring out the flavor of 18th century warfare. Shooting is *very deadly* at point blank range (1), but its effect attenuates dramatically as the range increases. Units that stand to receive a charge roll on a Volley Effectiveness Table to determine the range when they open fire. Poorer units will fire too soon and waste the potential destructiveness of the volley; better units can hold their fire on the attacker until they see the whites of their eyes.

There are also some chrome rules like sappers, Indians, Night Attacks, and the Simcoe/Tarelton Bugle Tactic.

From the publisher:

In terms of game mechanics, you play on an imaginary grid that represents the battlefield. Half your territory, half your opponent's. You win by either destroying your foe's Staging Area, or running them out of cards by keeping units in their territory. The more powerful the unit, the faster your opponent's cards go away. When they're out of cards, they sue for peace. Game over.

iA has no mana. Rather, you get a certain number of actions each turn, which can include collecting resource points, deploying units, making attacks or using special abilities. If you can't deploy a unit, spend an action to collect the resources you need to pay the cost! And, iA minimizes the luck of the draw. Your opening hand is exactly what you want. You start each battle with the forces you think will bring you victory. Of course, your opponent is doing the same, and only one of you will be right...

Verdun is a simulation of the 1916 German offensive that was supposed to bleed the French white in a single great battle of attrition, but instead turned into a bloody debacle of 10 months of slaughter.

The mechanics of the game are mostly conventional for hex and counter wargames. Movement, stacking, and Zones of Control are typical of most other games. Combat consists of artillery barrage and infantry assault.

Artillery can play a big part in the game, as it did historically in the battle. Players are limited in using their artillery by the ammunition factors they must keep track of on the Ammunition Availability Chart. Artillery expends ammunition factors when it fires, which may cause shortages. So, despite a large number of artillery units on both sides, players must use their guns judiciously.

Assault is done after movement and after artillery bombardment. Attackers must designate their assaults during the movement phase before artillery fire. As a result of artillery fire, both an attacker and defender can be severely affected. Attackers must carry out their assaults regardless of losses from artillery, which can be disastrous.

Supply rules are typical of many wargames. The rules provide means of destroying the opposing players artillery ammunition stocks and for interdicting rail lines and roads that serve as supply lines.

The game adds some chrome with German pioneers (who aid in assaults), balloons spotting for artillery, road interdiction (which affects French supply), and gas attacks. There are also rules for the Germans reducing the fortresses that surround Verdun.

While control of the city of Verdun is a primary victory condition for the game, the real key to victory is the amount of attrition each side does to the other.

Seven games that bring out the politician in all of us.

From the back cover:
This is a book of games and a book about politics. It is for anyone interested in politics, or who likes playing games - or who thinks the two are synonymous anyway. It is intended also as a useful adjunct for both teachers and students of politics, adding a practical, constructive but enjoyable dimension to their studies.
It is about getting your own way, seizing power, making money, reneging on your promises. Players can be politicians, form parties, fight elections, overthrow governments and make all kinds of deals. From 'Primitive Politics' to 'Rolling Logs' and from 'Elections' to 'Agenda', each game is an attempt to capture the cut and thrust of political double-dealing.

The author hopes that the games in this book will be fun to play and can be enjoyed by people who don't care about politics. However, the games are intended to show some aspect of the political process. Ten fundamental laws of nature that apply to all the games are set out in the first chapter of the book. Each subsequent chapter gives the rules of a new game and includes a discussion on strategy and how the game relates to reality.

The games in this book are:
1) Primitive Politics (number of players 2 to 2,000,000,000)
2) Entrepreneurs
3) Elections
4) Coalitions
5) Coelections
6) Rolling Logs
7) Agenda

The games can be played with a minimum of equipment - pencils, paper, money, playing cards.

The book was originally published be Pelican in 1979.  A revised edition was published by OUP in 1997.

They use a figure scale of 1 figure equals 20 men and a ground scale of 1 equals 20 paces.

Units are made up of five or more figures. Units are rated by such things as how they are armed, what kind or armor protection they have, how they are trained, and what level of morale they have.

Shooting and hand to hand combat are done by comparing the weapon of the attacker with the armor of the defender, and then adding tactical factors to get a total factor, which is then cross-referenced with the number of figures in the unit that is shooting or attacking. The result is an actual number of casualties in men, which players have to divide by 20 to see how many figures are removed from the unit. Casualties that are less than 20 are noted and added to further casualties later on. This way of recording casualties, which was unique to the WRG games of the 70s, is a nice way of getting around an all-or-nothing casualty removal system. Even if casualties are few in any single combat event, there is still a cumulative effect that can cause figure removal later on.

The morale of units may need to be checked with a Reaction Test for several reasons throughout the game. There are many variables that can affect the Reaction Test. Each variable adds to or subtracts from a roll of three average dice (2-3-3-4-4-5). The result is cross-referenced with the morale grade of the unit to determine the outcome. As a result of a Reaction Test, a unit may initiate an uncontrolled advance towards the nearest enemy, break and run away, or do something in between (the best result is always carry on).

Units are given orders at the start of a game. Units must move and attack according to their orders until they lose their orders through a failed Reaction Test or until the orders are changed. Orders are the only command/control mechanism in the game. Players always have one CinC figure and may have one or more sub-generals. The CinC and sub-generals mostly aid in combat and Reaction Tests.

The rules are complex and require players to use good tactical sense, which includes supporting units with other units (this helps in Reaction Tests) and knowing when and where to attack an opponent's units to get the best possible result. They are much more subtle than the Warhammer games produced by Games Workshop. They aren't designed for a quick bash 'em up. They take time to learn, but they reward players who use sound tactics rather than players who are lucky with dice.

The first edition of the rules covers warfare from about the beginning of the Italian Wars to the end of the English Civil Wars. The second edition adds things like handguns (primitive firearms) and plug bayonets that allow for wargaming battles from the latter part of the Hundred Years War, which saw the introduction of firearms, to the Nine Years War in the Low Countries, which was the end of the Pike and Shot era. The second edition also adds siege rules.

Note: The second edition rules are called Wargames Rules for Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries (1420-1700).

These wargame rules are based on an earlier set of rules by Dave Millward called Musketeer. They are also heavily based on Wargames Research Group's (WRG) 4th and 5th edition Ancients rules, which pioneered the basic game mechanics.

As with other WRG rules, several Army Lists were separately published that provide guidelines for players to create historical armies.

19309,Brandubh: Celtic Royal Chess,1932,6.5,2,0,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Ancient ,,"From the publisher:

Brandubh translates into Black Ravens or Black Crows in Ancient Gaelic and features a larger force of Robbers attacking the King and his Lords. Many versions of this game have been played by various Celtic peoples for thousands of years and pre-dates the various Viking Tafl-type Games by many centuries. While different rules exist, we have included those that we consider the most challenging and playable for both sides.

The rules for our version of this game come from studying the Ballinderry Board. The Ballinderry Game Board was found in 1932 during the excavation of a crannog, or lake dwelling at Ballinderry, West Meath, Ireland.

Our games are hand-crafted in the Acorn Games studios in the beautiful Monadnock Region of New Hampshire. The game boards are all hand drawn on leather and suede with Ancient Celtic symbols used for the placement marks. Each set also includes 8 jewel toned glass Robbers and 4 jewel toned glass Lords as well as a hand carved ceramic King in a classic terracotta color. Each King is highly detailed as you can tell from the picture below.

The complete rules as well as diagrams for alternate set-ups are permanently attached in the decorated storage box. Each box is hand decorated using a mix of Ancient Celtic designs and wood-burning to make for an attractive conversation piece. Each box measures approximately 4in. long x 3in. wide x 2 1/2in. high. Since each game is hand crafted, there will be natural color and shape variations in the game boards, playing pieces and box decorations.

Each BRANDUBH Game includes:
1 - Decorated display box with rules
1 - Leather or Suede Game Board
12 - Jewel toned Glass Playing Pieces
1 - Hand-Carved KING Piece

Players roll a die and move 1 to 3 spaces towards the red corner or the blue corner of the board, depending on which color was rolled. Property tiles may be bought and placed onto empty spaces that have been landed on or passed over. Existing properties may be moved in the same way, usually to form a TRYOPOLY: where all the property tiles within a group occupy the same row, and command a much higher rent.

The properties in this game were meant to be local and recognizable to the players, so there is no official version of this game. Each version features a different city (such as Cleveland, Kansas City, and Washington D.C.) and the businesses and organizations found there.

Beyond the galactic void, beyond the ISC, lies the Omega Sector, where mighty empires wage war, conquer vast territories, and are in their own turn destroyed.

It is a place of danger, death, and opportunity.

Module Omega One is the first in a new series of adventures for Star Fleet Battles players. It includes 46 new ships, 11 new races, 24 new weapons, and many new systems. The mighty Msron Alliance seeks to dominate the area, but is opposed on all sides by the antimatter weapons of the Koligahr, the implosion bolts of the Trobrin Empire, the particle beams of the Vari Combine, the fireballs of the Loriyill, the bioelectric bolts of the Alunda, the energy howitzers of the Chlorophon, the kinetic waves of the Sigvirions, and the hypercannons of the robotic Drex Unity.

Five scenarios only hint at the savage wars, titanic battles, and devastating conquests that mark the dangerously unstable Omega Sector. Enter at your own risk!

Originally, It is available only in the 5/2005 issue of Spielbox (this is the Essen Spiel edition, as the magazine is bimonthly). In 2006, the Dutch company 999 Games gave it away as an extra to those people who bought all scenarios in 999 Games' Six Scenarios series.

Also given as an insert in Games Quarterly magazine, Spring 2007, Issue 12.  This edition is published by Mayfair Games, Inc. and is the only one printed fully in English.

Lastest publishing was in 2007 as inclusion in Catan: Traders and Barbarians (with sightly expanded rules in comparison to Spiel Box edition).

The expansion is about fishermen. Some of the sea tiles of the base game are transformed into Fishing Grounds. These Fishing Grounds produce resources in a way similar to regular tiles.

Instead of Resource Cards, Fishing Grounds provide Fish Tiles. Fish Tiles can be worth one, two or three fish.

During his turn, a player can spend fish to get a special benefit:
2 fish: The player may move the robber back into the desert (he/she may not steal a card from another player who owns a settlement / town at the desert).
3 fish: The player may steal a raw material card from another player.
4 fish: The player may take any one raw material from the bank.
5 fish: The player may build a street immediately.
7 fish: The player receives a development card for free.

In addition to fish, a player can also catch an old shoe. As long as a player has the old shoe in his possession, he needs one more point to win the game than usual. He can get rid of the old shoe by giving it to someone with the same number of points or more points than himself.

Belongs to the Catan Series.

The ships range from small open galleys to large Hellenistic-era 16s (sixteen men per oar--the dreadnoughts of their time). Ship models are organized in squadrons of varying size. Each ship is rated by speed, ramming factor, and boarding factor. Ship's speed is also affected by crew quality.

The game is played on an area marked off by hexagons or offset rectangles. Terrain can be added in the form of coastline or rocks (or perhaps a Scylla and Charybdis).

Movement can be by oar, sail, or boat-sail. Each type of propulsion has its own pluses and minuses. Moving by oars can tire your crews, but moving by sail makes you subject to the wind--also, having a sail aboard your boats can be a negative for taking reaction tests (have sail, will sail away).

The action is pretty fast when ships start crunching together. The rules for ramming are simple and deadly. Boarding actions can be affected by the use of towers or ferrea manus (grappling devices such as the Roman corvus). Some ships may have war engines that can kill crew and reduce an opponent's boarding factor.

Once a squadron starts losing ships, it may be forced to retire by a negative Reaction Test result.

There isn't much chrome in these rules. Players wanting more detail on ship handling and employing ancient naval tactics (like the deikplous), should use a different set of rules. However, for gaming an action that involves a large number of ships, these rules allow fast play and a game resolution in a reasonable amount of time.

19354,The Devil at the Helm Naval Warfare 1850-1906,1978,6.625,4,3,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Civil War Miniatures Nautical Wargame ,Simulation,"The Devil at the Helm is a set of miniatures rules for naval warfare in the ironclad and pre-dreadnought eras.

From the introduction:

The years between 1850 and 1906 saw immense changes in naval warfare.

From lines of stately three-deckers, the great powers' fleets changed to a multitude of armoured warships, each unit of which represented a pinnacle of design and engineering skill. Forces became a hotch-potch of individual ships, differing widely in their abilities and deficiencies, as the older ships mixed with the new. Specialized missions and hostile environments sometimes necessitated vessels of novel and awkward design, such as the river craft of the American Civil War. With these new ships came new and terrifying weapons, destroying forever the world of Nelson and Hornblower.

However, two factors bound this era of change into a single period: the predominance of steam propulsion and the control of gunnery by individual gunners.

It is upon these two factors that this set of rules has been based, enabling players to experience the changes first hand as a continuous process rather than examining each conflict in the period as an event unrelated to any other, and to appreciate as a whole the era of naval warfare before the Dreadnought.

These rules offer some interesting mechanics to take into account the vast changes in naval warfare that occurred during the period they cover. Rules exist for maneuvering ships under sail, under steam power, and under a combination of both sail and steam.

Gunnery includes muzzle-loading smooth bore cannon, muzzle-loading rifled cannon, early breech-loading cannon, and modern naval ordnance. The gunnery also includes rules to cover the different effects of the rounds that could be fired, such as solid round shot, solid armor-piercing (AP) shot, later AP shell, and common shell.

Ships' armor values are calculated using tables in the rules that cover such things as the kind of metal (solid iron, laminated iron, mild steel, Harveyized steel, Krupp steel, etc.) and, for earlier ironclads, the type and thickness of the wood backing the iron armor.

For an aficionado of the era, the rules can be very interesting because of the details of ship design and armament that are addressed.

However, there is something about the wide scope of the rules that creates problems. For example, to determine where a shot hits, players roll on a table that lists the various parts of a ship. But the parts listed don't apply to all ships within the period. Things like secondary turrets don't exist on an ironclad ram. Inapplicable hits are simply assigned to one of two areas, but this tends to skew the hit allocation.

There are very few ready-to-go ship stats included in the rules. Players are expected to create ships stats to use in the game based on the guidelines in the rules for designing these using data from external sources, such as Jane's Fighting Ships, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, and others.

Players will also need to supply the templates used to determine the turning radii of the model ships. The ones included in the rules are hand drawn and not really suitable for play.

One the whole, The Devil at the Helm has a lot of good ideas and is a strong basis for a good set of naval wargame rules for this period. But they leave a lot of rough edges for the players to smooth.

Introduction

Fusil and Fortress is a Systems Analysis Classic Series game which offers the player an incredible amount of detail while providing a game which is easy to learn, interesting to read, and challenging to play. Fusil and Fortress is designed as a two-part game. Sections one through nine contain the rules required to play the tactical game, with Section three devoted to history, tactics, and organization. Sections ten through fourteen contain the rules for siege warfare, supply, engineering, and administration. Fusil and Fortress is not designed as a multi-level game in which you must learn more and more complicated rules. Once you have read the game, you can play it. We do this for two reasons. Our games are clearly written and our design staff feels that the wargamer has a lot more common sense than many games give him credit for. As an added bonus, Fusil and Fortress is designed to be played with or without an umpire.

We feel that Fusil and Fortress will be one of the most engaging games you have ever played. The reason for this is that all our designers are wargamers and understand problems with rules.

Designer's Notes

Because Fusil and Fortress is the first commercial wargame to effectively address warfare in the early 18th Century, the design staff felt that it was appropriate to discuss certain elements of game construction because of the radical departure from traditional game mechanics.

In most games, actual formations are sacrificed in order to cram the appropriate number of figures in the proper space. Thus, a one-deep line of figures may represent a two- or three-deep line of actual soldiers. While this method of game design may be perfectly acceptable for other eras, it would not be for the early 18th Century. Linear Infantry formations and numbers of ranks were of paramount importance and it would be impossible to use one rank of figures to represent more than one rank. Therefore, we have sacrificed a little space for accuracy and detail unknown in any other game. The upshot is that a unit will operate in the correct linear space in the proper number of ranks, but it will occupy an area slightly deeper than it actually would have. The rules have been formulated to mitigate this depth.

This unique design enables Fusil and Fortress to demonstrate the differences in the Dutch, Swedish, and French methods of musketry in a way you can actually see so that you can make them work the way they actually did.

The rules for artillery have also been designed to accurately represent the fall of shot and the occasional ricochet. The windage gauge is normally placed near the target which results in a smaller angular deviation of shot as the range increases. The inaccuracy of this method is obvious, and we have corrected it. Because of the design of the artillery firing system in Fusil and Fortress, no artificial additions for enfilade fire or other tactical advantages are needed.

The siege rules are a wargaming first and we do not believe that anything like them can be found anywhere. We have done everything possible to create in miniature the Vauban method of siegecraft and fortification. In conjunction with these unique combat and siege rules, we have also provided every last detail for engineering, supply, and administration, so that you can even pay your troops if you want to. You do not have to use all the information in Fusil and Fortress to have an exciting early 18th Century wargame, but when you do want information, it is there.

We feel that keeping these design differences in mind will help you understand the game better and enjoy it more. Good gaming.

During the game three stacks of eight checkers will form (five stacks of eight in the international version).  Stacks can be made up of any combination of the two colors in any order.  The player who wins the majority of the three stacks wins the game.

Two major mechanisms cause the players to cooperate in forming the three stacks of eight.  One mechanism brings stacks nearer to other stacks and a second mechanism merges adjacent stacks together.

There is no jumping, capturing, killing or any of the usual mechanisms.  Byte is a game of cooperation.  Someone will always win though - draws and ties cannot occur in Byte.

19365,Oil Rush,1980,7,2,0,2,4,15,15,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Dice Economic Exploration Territory Building ,Auction/BiddingDice RollingPaper-and-PencilTile PlacementVariable Phase Order,"I spot this game as a published one in about 1980 under the name Naftowa Gor#261;czka (Polish: Oil Rush), but then I used to play it using only pencil, paper and 2 six-sided dice.

Players act as oil companies. The board is 8x8 for 2 players, 9x9 for three ones and 10x10 for four players. Each player has 6 money units at the beginning.

TURN ORDER:

1) The active player points at a spot on a map and puts the bid he wishes to pay for it (often it's just 0). The players in clockwise order may overbid each other. When the high bid stands - the winner loses the declared amount of money and becomes the active player since then. (It is possible to take a few turns in a row if one has enough money!)

2) Dice are rolled to determine if oil is present. A sum of 9 or more is required. But if there is some oil on any of the fields with a common border line with the one the check is performed for, the number is reduced by 1 for each such field. If the oil is present on the fields with common corner with the chosen one, 1 is subtracted from the required number for each 2 such fields. Thus to find oil on a field completely surrounded by other oil fields (very rare situation!) a player needs only to throw 3 or more.

3) If the oil is not present, the field is marked as an empty one. If it is peresent it is marked as an oil field belonging to the active player, and the active player receives 1 money unit for each point he rolled over the required minimum. Thus if there was 1 fileld nearby, and a sum of 8 was required but 10 was rolled, the active player receives 2 money units. Note that it is possible to find oil and get no instant reward!

4) The clokwise neighbor of the active player becomes one. Go to 1. :-) Game ends when all the fields are checked.

5) Each player receives 10 points for each oil field he owns and one point for each money unit he has got at the end of the game. The player with most points wins. (It is possible to end in a draw).

All six games share in common the Skix Ball Wheel, a kind of reverse spinner in which a marble is launched and spins around the outside rim of the wheel until it lands in one of the many grooves along the inside hub of the wheel.

Each game has a circular paper disk that is placed over the hub in the center of the wheel; the disk gives a value or instruction to each groove on the inside hub. A two-sided gameboard is also included for four of the games.

The six games are as follows:

1) BADLANDS: Be the first to travel from St. Louis to Houston, watching for Indians and bandits.

2) HILL CHAMP: Get to the top of the hill by following a crisscrossing path.

3) SPORTS CAR RACE: Race against your opponents and be the first to cross the finish line.

4) TUG OF WAR: Pull the other team onto your side. Only one marker is used in this game, to determine where the center of the rope currently is.

5) SPELL-N-SCORE: This is one of two games that is played with pencil-and-paper, rather than the gameboard. Each player spins for five letters -- each with its own point value -- and attempts to make a word worth as high a score as possible.

6) CARDS (Poker, Black Jack, War): This is the other paper-and-pencil game(s). Shoot the marble to determine which cards are drawn for each of these games.

The character is either a fictional character, a historical character, or a real person depending on which board space the player landed on. The board consists of a single track with different colored spaces for the four type of characters (fictional, historical, occupation, or wild).

As in Taboo, the player is not allowed to say any of the words on the cards. The player is allowed to say what the character might say in that situation, use synonyms, body language, descriptive clues, etc. The game requires a fair amount of creativity since the combinations are often quite bizarre.

Crazy Talk was a Games 100 winner.

Each turn players roll the dice. The number rolled represents the amount of squares that the player can use to move his marbles. Only 1 base color is permitted to move per dice roll. To his choice, the player can move as he pleases the 2 marbles (if possible) of the same base color.

A player can push more than 1 marble.
A player cannot push his own marbles directly. He has to do it by pushing the opponents marbles(s) on his own.
A marble moved cannot end up on the same square it started its turn on, unless it has pushed one of the opponent's marbles before ending on this square.
The center square is made up of 4 distinctive squares. A marble has to be pushed to make a move in the center square.

When a marble is pushed in the center square, this marble is considered taken and cannot be used or moved directly. To take out a marble from the center square, one of the opponent's marbles will have to be pushed against it in order to push it out of the center square.

The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case the City of BOLTON in the North-West of England.

Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.

Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.

Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.

The New Share Quotations square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.

The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:
- After a set time.
- When the first player becomes bankrupt.
- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.

At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.

     numbers = the first card must have number 1, the second number 2 etc. This is only important for letters that occur more than once, e.g the u and e



     pictures = no picture may appear twice while constructing the word


A turn consists of picking up a new card, and putting one down, either on the discard pile or for constructing the word muse du louvre. You are also allowed to replace a card already laid out with another one from your hand.

Players start with 4 cards in their hand.

Jokers can be used to replace a card TEMPORARILY, i.e. by the end of the game a player must have replaced all his jokers with the corresponding cards.

First player to make the word is the winner, other players total the numbers in their hand; after a few rounds, the winner is the player who accumulated the least points.

Prior to play the contraption is assembled.  A spinner at the base of the contraption directs the action of players at they attempt to collect small plastic colored hoops of varying values from the end of a plastic chute, using a unicyclist.  The unicyclist moves around a circular 'trapeze' wire by manipulating the angle of the circle using handles which are attached to the device.  The plastic chute in which the hoops are placed is located at the top of the contraption; gravity replaces captured hoops at the chute opening.  Hoops are worth 10 (red), 50 (black) or 100 (blue) points, depending on the diameter of the hoop hole.

There are two settings on the contraption - 'EASY' and 'HARD'.  Players have the opportunity to acquire opponents' hoops during the game if they manage to get the unicyclist to collect hoops when on the 'HARD' setting.  Hoops equal to the value collected by the player on that turn are taken from opponents in any combination.

If either hoops or the unicyclist fall from the contraption during a player's turn, they are penalized.

When all hoops have been collected from the chute by the unicyclist, scores are tallied and the player with the highest score is the winner.

Deep within the Palace is a Secret Garden where Buddhist Elders bring student monks to test them in the arts of focus, meditation and concentration. On the floor of the garden is etched a grid of 312 squares. Here, 2-4 students at a time are challenged to place colored stones on the grid, with the ultimate goal of placing more stones than the others. Their work is guided by two deceptively simple rules...

In addition, as the stones are placed, an Elder walks silently around the perimeter of the garden, keeping a tally of all he sees...

It was sold at branches of a book-cum-stationery shop chain, Popular Bookstore.

The game is for 2 to 6 players and players each have a coloured pawn that moves along a spiral track towards an End Point. Along the way, players follow instructions on spaces they land on, including taking two kinds of chance cards.

The Personal Hygiene card is drawn when landing on a Personal Hygiene square  players follow whatever instructions are written on these cards. The See Doctor cards may be drawn when landing on a Symptoms square, or also after landing on a Check Your Temperature square and rolling a 4, 5, or 6 (on lower numbers your temperature is normal, so you naturally dont need to see a doctor).

Players may also get sent to Hospital or be put under Home Quarantine. Being in the Hospital is worse as the player proceeds to Home Quarantine after discharge from hospital.

The game has lots of humorous touches that reflect the atmosphere at the time. One of the pre-game preparation rules is, All players must wash their hands thoroughly before playing. Theres also a rule concerning expulsion from the game, You are not allowed to continue with the game when you are expelled because of reckless, irresponsible personal misconduct that jeopardizes the entire community.

The first player to reach the End Point is the overall winner of the game. The other players can continue to play the game. Ominously, the last player left is the loser, who may be punished appropriately.

In the game, the players build up a landscape with six-sided tiles (forest, rich meadows, lean meadows, farmland, lake, village and quarry). The players look for rare plants and animals at the corners of these tiles. There are four face-up animal or plant tiles which indicate which landscape types they must touch in order to be found there. Plants and animals, once found, are worth points.
The players travel as gnomes via dragonfly, badger, bird and grasshopper. The landscape determines which tiles can be crossed with which type of transportation. Players can only use the same type of transportation again after they have used all four at least once.

The eight ebony totems and the prestigious gold totem, vestiges of an ancient civilization, were stolen by Rastapopoulos from the ethnographic museum. Tintin and his companions set out at once to recover them. But the stolen copies of the totems are spread out around the world and confuse the tracks of the investigators. Only a magic key will make it possible to find the treasures of the museum.

Of the 20 ebony totems, 12 are real! Only the magic key will reveal them to you... collect as many of the Totems as possible, but avoid conflicts with Rastapopoulos the gangster. Character cards direct you in your investigation or help you to thwart the schemes of your adversaries. Brought into play at the end of the game, the gold totem must still be recovered for victory.

translated (badly) from rulebook and entry from Club de Stratgie de Moissy-Cramayel

Translated from the Dutch box:
A breathtaking game full of adventures with Tin Tin and his friends.
Face Rastapopoulos in a duel and win the mysterious Totem Dhor.
But beware! 12 of the 20 Totems are traps! Only the magical cassette can point you in the right direction.

Gameplay information:
Every square on the board represents one of Tintin's adventures and contains a black totem pole. You have to use a magnet to learn if the totem is a good one or a trap. If the totem moves away from the magnet, it is a trap. If it pulls towards you it is one of the 8 good ones. Players check the totems individually and place it on the middle of the appropriate adventure square. This means the nature of this totem is known to one of the players. He must memorize all the totems he checked. In the second part (when all totems are known by one or more players), when a player starts an the adventure players have to tell the other players what status the totem has, if he is right he gets the totem. If he gets it wrong he loses a research point.

When all 8 good totems are found the golden Rastapopoulos totem is placed for the final adventure. When players cross Rastapopoulos himself they have to fight him (by a throw of the dice).

When a player loses all his points he has to start at the beginning of the board and receives 4 new points to re-enter the race until the golden totem is reached.

19524,Turning Point,2005,6.33333,3,2.6667,1,2,120,120,Wargames,American Revolutionary War Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemHand ManagementSimulation,"Published in 2005 by BSO Games (DTP), the description is from the GMT website, when it was on their p500 list.

It's Turning Point, a game covering the pivotal battle of Freeman's Farm, at Saratoga. It features all the units, from Morgan's Rifles to the British grenadiers, and all the dense, wooded terrain you would normally expect, but in a way you've probably not seen before.

The game uses two decks of cards, one deck for each player to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of his cards each turn, never his full deck, and his allotment is usually different (in terms of number and type) from his opponent. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and special items, such as Indian Stealth, Counter-Attack, Rifle Fire, and Rapid Movement, among others. Players may play as many cards as they wish when it's their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards  and the Turn is over.

Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the map of Freeman's Farm, which uses squares, rather than hexes,. You're still moving units, trying to outflank, attacking with what you hope are better odds (since you don't know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be), and using your cards, and wits, to outplay your opponent.

Turning Point was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.

19525,Sibling Rivalry,2004,4.83333,3,1,2,5,20,20,,Dice Humor ,Dice Rolling,"Sibling Rivalry is a commissioned game from Richard Garfield for the game design textbook Rules of Play, by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.

Players are siblings trying to annoy each other.  The game is played on two boards: the challenge board and the score track.  By advancing a marker on the challenge board, you can score points on the score track.  The first player to reach the end of the score track wins.

The heart of the game is a push your luck dice mechanism to advance on the challenge board.  A player begins by rolling five dice, setting aside ones.  Other numbers can be used to advance a pawn along one of five columns, representing Looks, Faces, Tickles, Ouchies, and Teases.  After each roll, you can either stop or keep rolling.  If you stop and your pawn is the most advanced pawn in that column, then you remove any pawn it passed.  If it is not the most advanced, then you remove your pawn from the challenge board.  If your pawn has not been removed from the board by your next turn, then you score points for it on the score track.

You can keep rolling dice to advance your pawn farther up the challenge board, but when you accumulate three or more ones, your parents have caught you picking on your sibling.  Your turn ends and you lose points.

His duties are as follows: he selects a card from the deck; he scrambles the letters of a word on the card, which is indicated by the board or the second die; he presents that scrambled word; he determines who is the first to correctly identify the word (and whether a tie has taken place). The other players have one minute to identify the word. The first to identify the word gains (or keeps) control of the dice.
If no player correctly identifies the word, play continues to the left.

This process continues until a winner is determined.

The players can also have great fun and laughter with the creative catch-phrases that are used to portray the interesting places.

The object of Maze is to construct a maze with as few tiles as possible, and to move your pawn through it from Start to Finish.

Each player starts with their Start/Finish tile on the table. Each turn, the player rolls a pair of dice. That player will then choose 2 out of the 3 options to perform, and allocates one of the rolled dice to each of those options. The options are:

Option 1: The player turns tile face up from a face down stack, until the number of face up tiles matches the number on the chosen die.

Option 2: The player chooses the number of tiles indicated by the die, and adds those tiles to their existing maze.

Option 3: The player advances their pawn through their maze as many squares (there are 2 squares per tile) as the die indicates.

The tiles have various configurations of bold lines around certain edges, indicating walls of the maze. When the maze is completed, it must be fully enclosed by the border, and all squares must be reachable by the pawn.

The round ends when a player has completed their maze and has moved the pawn from the Start to the Finish, entering Finish with an exact die roll. Alternatively, a round can end when both players have run out of tiles, and one of them has reached the end of their incomplete maze. Scores are tallied using various factors (number of squares in the maze, number of squares needed to complete the maze, number of squares the pawn needs to travel to reach the Finish, number of squares on unused face up tiles), and low score wins the round.

Rules are also included for variants to adjust the difficulty of the game.

Cards are shuffled and dealt 5 to a player. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is turned over to start the discard pile.

On a player's turn, he may take the top card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. He then discards a card.

Each player aims to collect two sets - one of 3 cards and a pair. When a player completes a set during his turn, he places it face up on the table in front of him. The first player to lay both sets on the table is the winner.

19598,Period Pieces,1976,3,1,0,2,4,30,30,,Card Game ,Set Collection,"This card game was published for the (British) National Trust by Dinosaur Publications.

The game comprises a set of 48 cards, 44 of which depict different furnishings from the Jacobean, Georgian, Victorian and Modern periods. The other 4 are 'House' cards, and they are used as Jokers which can be substituted for any other card.

The object of the game is to collect two sets of 3 or 4 object cards of the same period (e.g. Jacobean) or 3 or 4 object cards of the same type (e.g. lighting). The sets are:

1. Kettles
2. Tables
3. Clocks
4. Chairs
5. Toys
6. Cradles
7. Cabinets
8. Lighting
9. Musical Instruments
10. Irons
11. Vessels

PLAY
Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest are turned face down to form the draw pile, with the top card being turned face up to start the discard pile. Each player in turn draws the top card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. He then discards a card. As a player collects a set of 3 cards he may, if he wishes, place them face upwards on the table in front of him and score their total. Any player having the fourth card to the set may, in turn, place it in front of himself and score its number. The game ends when one player has disposed of all the cards in his hand.

SCORING
Cards score according to the numbers on them. House cards score 20. All cards still in the hand of a player score against him, and all cards on the table score for the player who has collected them. The first player to score 200 points is the winner.

The first player at bat shuffles the cards, turning over 1 card at a time, until he gets a hit or an out. If he gets a hit, he places the card on the indicated base. The play is carried on as in an actual baseball game. When 3 outs are made, the playing side is retired. The opposing team comes to bat and the cards are reshuffled.

Special rules can be made. For example, it is optional to advance all base runners one extra base on a single and a double. This game may also be played as a party game where players take positions on bases.

A record of the balls, strikes and outs may be kept by a member of the opposing team calling out each card as it is turned over.

You never have to roll dice, move markers, count change, or jam annoying little plastic pieces together.

You simply need to hang out and have fun.

Take out the PersonaliTease party game and have everyone guessing who answered questions like What do you enjoy doing, even though you know it's wrong? One playerthe emceecollects personality answers from the group, reads them out loud once or twice, and waits for everyone to guess which answer belongs to which player. There's plenty of bluffing and second-guessing involved here, and (fortunately) little opportunity for hard feelings to develop, as can sometime be the case with other games of this kind. The game can go as quickly as you like, or linger for a long evening of discovery if you want to really explore the mysteries of your friends' minds.

19626,Diceland: Penny Arcade,2005,7.11538,13,2,2,4,20,20,,Action / Dexterity Collectible Components Comic Book / Strip Dice Expansion for Base-game Fighting ,Dice Rolling,"Single die Diceland expansion released as a Summer 2005 promo. Features Penny Arcade characters.

All Diceland sets are 25 dice. Ogre was 17 dice, but Space used the rest of the sheet with 8 dice. Cyburg and Dragons were both 12 dice, leaving Cheapass with one space left. So they slapped some Penny Arcade graphics on it (yes, from the webcomic) and you have a special die.

Interestingly, though, it's not just another die. It introduces a few new concepts. One is Hammer, which hits a target die multiple times. Another interesting aspect is that it's actually two dice! You see, in Diceland, most dice get damaged one side at a time, from side 8 to side 1. The Penny Arcade die, however, has two side 4s, side 3s, 2, and 1 - essentially, it's like two 4-sided Diceland dice stuck together. There are also ways to shift from one 'track' to another, changing the abilities of the die. Interesting.

19632,The Invasion of Sicily,1972,6.9,5,0,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Dice Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"This fine game was published in 1972 in Panzerfaust magazine, with an unmounted map in four sections, unstapled rulebook in two sheets, and unmounted two-sided counters -- one of the very first (if not the first) wargames to use two-sided counters for step reduction. Fortunately, a mounted die-cut set of counters was available for like $1 additional, so we were spared the nightmare of trying to hand-mount two-sided counters shudder.

The Mapsheet consists of four sections (mine are hand-glued into one map) showing the island of Sicily, in light and dark blue and light and dark brown on white paper, 19 x 27 assembled. The Combat Results table (from 1-4 to 7-1), Terrain Effects chart (six types), Time Record track (12 four-day turns), Unit Designations Within Divisions chart (initial Axis), German Order Of Battle chart (reinforcements and What If? units), and Allied Order of Battle chart (initial and reinforcements) are all printed on the mapsheet. The starting Axis locations for the historical scenario are printed on the map, as are the historical and alternate Allied landing sites.

The Rulebook assembles into 8 pages. Front is picture, title and credits. Second page is historical info (Introduction). The next four pages are rules and victory conditions. Then 1/2-page of (six) alternate scenarios, 1/2 page of designer's notes, and 1/2-page of bibliography (on the last page, with instructions for assembling the mapsheet).

Units are mostly regiments and brigades (or similarly-sized kampfgruppen), with some battalions, some Italian divisions, and an Army HQ for each army (4). There are 120 of the 1/2 counters -- 22 Americans (olive green, 3 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 18 British and Canadians (dark olive green, 1 is Army HQ), 39 Italians (yellow, 3 are divisions, 11 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 25 Germans (tan, 1 battalion, 1 Army HQ), and 16 blanks, some of each color. The mounted counters are unique in that the full-strength side is printed on what is normally considered the back of the counter. While it doesn't look as nice, it does actually facilitate handling the counters - they are easier to pick up. Another idea that never caught on.

This is not a complex game, more along the lines of the old Conflict games. The game sequence is 1. Allied airdrops; 2. Allies move; 3. Allied combat and post-combat moves; 4. Axis airdrops; 5. Axis moves; 6. Axis combat and post-combat moves. ZOCs are fluid for movement and rigid for combat. Combat is odds-based, with step losses, retreats and advances indicated for both attacker and defender. For example, at 1-1 odds, the results are: 1. Att 1 step retr 1, Def adv 1; 2. Att 2 steps retr 2, Def adv 1; 3. Att 1 step, Def 1 step retr 1; 4. no effect; 5. Def retr 1; 6. Def 1 step, retr 2. Stacking is 3 regt/brig. Rules for invasions, airdrops, supply, evacuations, and naval support fire are all simple and non-cluttered.

One interesting aspect is Italian desertion. On turn one, the Axis player must roll for every Italian non-infantry unit, losing it to desertion on a 3-6 on 1D6. The Italian infantry are sturdier, and will not desert unless attacked at 3-1 or more with no German unit within three hexes.

Victory conditions are based on three elements: Italian desertion, casualties, and cities held. Levels of victory are: Axis wins if he has more than 3/4 of Allied points, decisively if equal or more; game is drawn if Axis has less than 3/4 but at least 2/3 of Allies points; otherwise Allies win. Also, the Axis win immediately if they destroy both the US 7th Army and UK 8th Army HQs (not bloody likely).

I can't believe no one ever listed this game before. It is one of my all-time favorites.

The Box Office theatrical board game is based on producing plays for the stage.  As a player, you become a producer seeking to win by earning the most money by producing plays.

The Box Office theatrical board game has been developed by Canadian Cultural Consultants Corporation as a fund raising tool for Canadian and American theaters.

As producers, players move around the board, which represents various North American theaters, seeking to produce plays to which they own the rights.  If producers don't have the right compliment of actors in their stable, they may have to barter with other producers to borrow an actor with the right talents.

Another part of the game board are a few 'Make Or Break' spaces, which add in a number of random events, such as losing or gaining an actor, or added box office revenues.

Winner is the producer who first reaches a certain dollar number, which the players pre-determine.

Rules specify four players, don't know why it couldn't be played with fewer.

On your turn you must answer a question from one of the Question Cards.  Each Card has four different numbers on it.  If you answer the question correctly, you can move your marker a number of spaces equal to any one of the numbers on the card.  If you fail to answer a question, you cannot move and you must share some information from one of your Information Cards.

Components:
-    Mounted Game Board
-    Location Tiles (one for each country on the game board)
-    Player Markers (6)
-    Information Sheets (25)
-    Question Cards (270, double-sided)

He always gives the correct answer - he is a very clever little man!

A player who has filled a row of symbols picks up the six dice and places a strip of cardboard over that row of symbols and continues to play, attempting to match dice with symbols in any of the remaining rows.  The same player continues to play as long as he can complete an uncovered row of symbols.  As rows are filled (or covered) the game becomes more challenging.  Filling a row in the three rolls becomes more difficult.  If a player does succeed in covering all the rows without ever giving up the dice, he has achieved the IMPOSSIBLE.

The owner of the game simply specifies a number of 'teams' for a league, and then plays out a number of contests to determine a winner.  The 'teams' are simply a bunch of names, since players have no specific individual characteristics.

The game engine is a set of 100 cards with a series of play results on them.  Results are situation specific; thus a play with one out will turn out differently depending on whether there are runners on 1st base, 2nd, 3rd, or none on.  Each card also has two orientations, with a different set of play results on each side.

The game was marketed in conjunction with The Sporting News magazine.  Included was an abbreviated version of TSN's booklet, Batting And Pitching Averages At A Glance, which is designed to help the player figure out batting averages and other stats for his 'teams'.

19667,Advanced Tactics,2003,6,1,1,2,2,20,20,,Card Game ,Secret Unit Deployment,"This game has been described as glorified War, but that description is almost entirely misleading.  Advanced Tactics uses one standard deck of cards for each player. The players battle over pairs of cards face up on the table, and draw three cards that are used to augment the strength of one or more of the pairs of cards in play. Clubs count as negative points, and diamonds require another card to be drawn for that column. The object of the game is not to simply win more cards, but to win point cards. Point cards start with the Aces, then move to Kings when all of the Aces are claimed, and so on. Play is continued until all points are claimed through a pre-agreed goal (for example, if playing to Queens, then the game will end when all Aces, Kings, and Queens are claimed). The player with the most point cards wins. This makes for interesting longer-term strategy as well as the obvious short-term strategy of winning the current cards on the table.

Complete rules for this game are in the July 2007 issue of Knucklebones magazine. Several rules variants are also included.

Lord Fisher started it all when, in December of 1905, he approved the laying of the keel of Dreadnought, the first of a type of line of battle ship that would make everything built before it obsolete and whose concept would dominate the big gun ships of major navies for the next 40 years. By the eve of the Great War full fleets of these vessels faced each other across the narrow European seas, ready to fight for domination of the open ocean.

In an integrated combat system the game covers shell strengths, immune zones, armor placement, gun ranges, and angle of incoming shot without resort to complicated calculations. Detailed rules on movement, command, and other vital factors complete the game. 400 unit counters are included to cover every European, American,  Japanese dreadnought of the period.

Scenarios include Dogger Bank, Jutland, and hypothetical battles.

The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case the town of LURGAN in Northern Ireland. It is situated on the south shores of the Lough Neargh, 20 miles south-west of Belfast.

Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.

Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.

Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.

The New Share Quotations square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.

The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:
- After a set time.
- When the first player becomes bankrupt.
- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.

At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.

Small and Big Animals:

Each player in turn flips a card.  If you notice a complete animal on your turn then you collect all of the cards that make up the animal.

This game is distinctly different from the other Ricken/Triaktiv games being predominantly Black in colour where the norm is a green or plum colour. See the pictures for greater detail of this.

Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.

Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.

Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.

The New Share Quotations square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.

The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:
- After a set time.
- When the first player becomes bankrupt.
- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.

At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.

Students start by learning the geography of a small community,  then move on to explore the United States, the Western Hemisphere, and ultimately the world.  Along the way, students practice a battery of skills useful for the understanding of any map.  In addition, the challenging, action-oriented games will convince students that exploring their world is more than a necessity, it can be a pleasure.

Educational Objectives:  Students become familiar with the basics of directionality, distance and scale, geographical detail and problem solving.

The Exploring Your World Geography Games set consists of four (4) games created to provide meaningful and interesting experiences for students in the instruction and application of geography and map reading skills.  The four games, and the instructional objectives of each are:
City Limits - Directionality, distance and scale, land formation, transportation modes, and problem solving.
States Race - Position and shape of the 48 continental United States, capital cities, time zones, geographical and cultural landmarks.

19722,With Hostile Intent,2005,8.375,4,4.5,2,8,120,120,Wargames,Miniatures Science Fiction Wargame ,,"From the designer:

With Hostile Intent is a table-top starship combat game where players using fleets of starships, ranging from a few vessels to large squadrons, battle each other using strategy and tactics.

The game uses an inertia/vector based movement system and is hex-less - meaning ship placement and movement is not constrained to a location on a hex map or other specific playing surface. Movement and orientation are kept track of in three dimensions using a simple and intuitive (math-less) method of dealing with line of sight, along with easily understood indicators on the ship control sheets. Range determination is performed simply by measuring distance with a tape measure and checking a chart, to take into account altitude.

Damage is tracked through a common damage-box method with damageable systems individually represented, along with hit location charts on the ship control sheets. Weapon information is likewise available on the ship control sheets.

Aside from the 3D aspects of the game, here are some features in development which are not commonly found in starship combat games:

Computer Warfare - the ability for ships to infect enemy vessels with computer viruses, jam missile guidance systems, or even steal control of enemy weapons or systems.

Crew Levels - A ship may drop out of a fight if it takes too many losses to its crew.

Damage Control - Ships can make limited battlefield repairs, things like bringing a damaged weapon back online or getting a thruster to work again.

Fires - Ships can catch fire, fires can spread, and crew members can be sacrificed when fires are vented to space.

Fuel and cargo - Makes for a wider range of possible scenarios as well as a seamless tie-in to campaign games.

Adaptable Game System - While the game will provide its own exciting universe, from the ground up it is being designed with the intent that others can adapt it to their favorite universe with relative ease. Having this foundation will also give the game and its setting the ability to grow without the system falling apart or failing in some regard.

WHI will be consistent and predictable with its ability to simulate movement in space, but it will not be a rigid simulation or necessarily be mathmatically accurate. It will be relatively quick and easy to play but will not be simplistic. It will have a lot of detail suitable for a wide range of battle sizes as well as adaptation to other gaming applications (roleplaying, campaigns, etc), but will avoid being tedious or micromanagerial.

The goal is for the game to be fun to play, first and foremost.

The Cashier shuffles the cards and deals them face down into six piles,one for each store.Cashier spins the spinner to tell the first player to his left which store he'll be going too. The player picks up the top card of that store pile, turns it over, and reads aloud what it says. He then pays the Cashier for his purchases as shown on the card. The Cashier must check the payment and also any change that is given. The Cashier spins the spinner to see which store the next player will go to, and so on. Play continues until some player cannot Pay the Cashier because he dose not have the money. Then the other players count their money and the winner is the player with the most money left.

19733,Dealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker,2005,7.66667,18,2,0,0,0,0,,Bluffing Book Card Game ,Betting/Wagering,"From the back cover copy:

We all know that money won is twice as sweet as money earned, and there are plenty of books to help you if you want to mortgage the house to take on the $30-$60 table at the Mirage or the Taj Mahal. But most of us are looking for a friendlier species of the game, a chance to test our luck in the company of friends, and, if we are favored with good fortune and they are not, to really, really rub their noses in it. Dealer's Choice is the ultimate guide to the world of low stakes poker, where fun and bragging rights count as least as much as the final tally.

Starting with the elementary principles of the game every beginner will need to know before swimming with the sharks--betting, bluffing, and the hierarchy of hand values--Dealer's Choice features invaluable tips on how to host the perfect poker evening (the relative merits of chips versus coins, what food to serve) and more than 200 varieties of poker, from established favorites like Baseball and Follow the Queen to truly esoteric mutations of the authors' own invention such as Frankenstein, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and Hamlet (i.e., Jacks are low, Queens are wild, Kings dead). Renowned illustrator Phil Foglio has enlivened the text with spectacular line drawings.

With worldwide interest in poker at an unprecedented peak, Dealer's Choice gives casual players the chance to re-create, right in their own living rooms, the excitement of the World Series of Poker ... except without the five million dollar jackpot--but pizza and beer aren't bad either.

19734,North Sea,1974,3.5,2,2,2,4,0,0,,Economic Industry / Manufacturing ,Dice RollingTrading,"North Sea Oil is another venture into the combined realm of education and entertainment, developed by Shell Oil. Its goal is to both entertain and to inform people of (and gain support for) the efforts to develop oil fields off the coast of Great Britain.

Two to four players compete at running their respective oil companies. Players will need to temporarily go into debt to bring oil production on line. The first player to have two producing oil fields *and* to be out of debt is the winner.

No copyright date is given, but the Oil and Gas writeup included with the game describes events that took place in 1973 and expresses hopes that the Brent oil field will be producing oil in 1976. This places the game firmly in the early to mid 1970 time frame.

Waddingtons' North Sea Oil is a different game entirely from the North Sea Oil offering by Omnia around the same time frame.

It was a single deck of cards that contained various types of cards that represented calls in baseball (i.e. ground ball, single, home run, wild pitch, etc.).

The players laid out the cards for the bases in the traditional diamond formation and then used runner cards to mark where their team's players were on those bases. Players took turns at bat/pitching. Based on the cards drawn, they moved their players around the bases and scored runs. Essentially, it used the same rules as baseball itself ... but they were simulated using a deck of specialty cards.

The game was distributed at Esso stations in Canada during the summer of 1988 (for about $2). For baseball fanatics, this was a fun diversion.

Contents of the deck:
63 game cards
4 base cards
4 runner cards

Instead, the other students in the wager will do that student's chores for him or her. Next semester you're slated to muck out the dragon hatchery three times a week. If there's a worse chore at the school, you don't know what it is. This semester, you either win the wager, or your nickname will be, 'Stinky.' Good luck!

Object: Be the first student to complete a full course load of spells (9 credits worth).

You need:

* Letter tiles (Ingredients) (available on the website)
    * A Spell Deck (available on the website)
    * Beads or coins to keep track of Spirit

This is a basic roll-and-move, follow-the-trail game, which includes shortcut spaces for those fortunate to land on them, and also the Bear Den spaces, which forces the unlucky hiker to re-roll the die and move back the indicated number of spaces.

The six-sided die has a bear where the 1 would go, and would normally be treated as a 1.  The bear prevents players from using the shortcuts, and if it comes up on a player's penalty roll (after landing in a Bear Den), that player must move back to Start.

This game, along with others in Channel Craft's Vintage Game Series, comes in a small tin.  Movement is made with pegs, which rest in a hole after each move, making it a suitable choice for travel.

19761,FIRE The Exciting Game of Firefighting,1984,0,0,0,0,0,120,120,,Fighting ,Co-operative PlaySimulation,"FIRE puts one or more players in the role of a city fire department chief or battalion chief in a department.

The mounted board is an 18 x 15 inch representation of an urban environment including streets and alleys, business and residential districts, industry and fire stations.  Structures are color-keyed green for low buildings and blue for multistory.

The playing pieces are squares and rectangles of 3/8 plexiglass.  Self-adhesive colored stickers are applied producing lime-green miniature fire command vehicles, rescue ambulances, fire engines and ladder trucks.

The standard game is 24 turns long, represent a 24-hour shift.  Each turn, a die roll determines whether zero, one, or two alarms are received.  Each building on the map is marked with a street address.  Every time an alarm is received, a label corresponding to a board location is drawn randomly, indicating the site of the alarm.

An alarm may be indicated as a medical emergency, a call (corresponding to a local alarm in many fire departments) or a 1st Alarm (potentially, a more serious situation).

The controlling Player determines which assets to dispatch to the scene depending on nature of incident and location.  Responses range from a single rescue ambulance for a medical emergency up to a multi-station response for a multistory structure, row house with multiple exposures or industrial complex.

Each game-turn is broken down into three impulses.  Each impulse, emergency vehicles may move up to eight squares toward a scene.  Physical space limitations often play a role, since alleys are only one square wide.  Pumpers take up two squares, ladder trucks three, making traffic control important when placing apparatus (particularly ladder trucks, which must be within reach of the structure in question).

Beginning in the second impulse, as long as at least one unit has arrived the controlling player may attempt to resolve the incident.  Resolution may determine that the call is a false alarm, that the fire has been extinguished, or that it continues to burn or intensifies.  At the player's discretion, he may wait until the third impulse before resolving the situation, in order to allow more assets to arrive.

Each unit type has a points value representing its firefighting capabilities.  Certain combinations of units--such as two engine companies, a truck company, and a chief officer--have a higher value than the face value of the units present, representing the fire ground tactics such combinations make possible--primary and secondary search, fire suppression, water supply, ventilation, exposure protection, fire ground command, etc.

The point total of firefighting assets present is cross-indexed to a die roll on the Results Table and an outcome determined.  Fires not extinguished at the end of the game-turn intensify one level (defined in the game as 1st Alarm, 2nd Alarm, etc. through 5th Alarm).  Fires of 2nd Alarm intensity or greater spread to adjacent spaces, either to a neighboring building or to additional spaces within a single large structure.  Poorly placed fire apparatus may also be destroyed by expanding fires.

Each new game-turn the alarm determination process is followed, meaning that new incidents may be generated.  It is important to hold some department assets in reserve to allow for responses to additional incidents.  The entire department numbers one Marshal (Chief of Department), three Battalion Chiefs, twelve Engine Companies, five Ladder Companies and six Rescue Ambulances distributed in six stations of various sizes.  Relocation of uncommitted assets is sometimes necessary to maintain adequate fire protection during major fires.

Rules cover wind direction, firefighter injuries, apparatus breakdown or other loss while responding, and, optionally, water supply.

The goal of FIRE is to maintain public safety at the lowest possible level of asset activity.  At the end of each turn, points are assessed for each unit out of quarters, whether fighting a fire or returning from a call.  The object is to achieve the lowest possible score while efficiently handling emergencies--a balancing act between dispatching sufficient assets and using assets efficiently.

Some of Featherstone's comments illustrate that the complexity vs. realism debate was not restricted to the board wargaming hobby:

If it is to be acknowledged that the game is the thing, to be played for enjoyment and relaxation and not as a form of military exercise or training, then the campaigner with model soldiers will be well advised to confine himself to a simple set of rules with a reasonable resemblance to the period in which he is fighting. However, if he has the sort of mind that likes to explore far afield and look in to all corners, he will probably, at some time or another in his wargaming career, find himself embroiled in obtuse calculations that seemingly do little to enhance enjoyment of the game. Certainly the author, in more than fifteen years of wargaming, has never consciously considered other than the simplest aspects of movement and the ground-scale, yet has consistently enjoyed in every period of military history campaigns which have provided realistic resemblance to the tactics and manner of fighting of those periods.

19792,The Rats of Rottenberg,2005,0,0,0,2,6,45,45,,,Action Point Allowance SystemArea MovementSet CollectionVariable Player Powers,"Overview: Castle Rottenberg is infested with rats! King Alfred has hired the best rat trappers in his kingdom to rid his castle of the lowly vermin before his Queen returns. The problem? The Queen will arrive in only six hours! The rats have to be taken care of...and soon! With a little bit of the Wizards magical help and your own wits, you attempt to impress the King with your abilities. But the Wizard also has an interest in what you trap. Will you be able to match wits with your competition and secure the rights of trap master in this land? Can you catch the vilest and most numerous of rats and secure your position as a member of the Kings loyal staff?

Goal of the game:
The players will move from room to room trying to trap as many of the rats as they can, by using magic items and outmaneuvering their opponents.
The rats have three point values depending on their degree of nastiness:
    1: plain old rat
    2: aggressive rat
    3: diseased rat
The rats also come in four colours:
    black, white, grey, and brown.
Most of the valuable rats are of black colour, followed by brown, grey, and white. This may lead some players to choose to pursue only black or brown rats in their quest. However, the Wizard is a strange sort and wants to use the rats of all colours for his potions and magic. He rewards players handsomely for having rats of each colour. Keeping in mind that the white rats are the least common, and the black rats are most numerous, it is the rat trapper who can balance the best of both strategies who will ultimately win the game.
This game features a very innovative game board design: a northern cross section of the castle is one one side of the board, and the southern cross section of the castle is on the other side of the board, in such a way that the roofs are almost touching. Each room presented on the cross sections have doors leading east/west/both, but also have a door set into their back wall of the room which leads to the other side of the board and the other cross section.

Players roll to move around an intersecting track that includes a space for each state and spaces with instructions (Free TV, Major Fundraiser, Go to Home Region, Good News, Minor Set-Back, Minor Foul-Up, Major Disaster).

The states are divided into five regions, and ranked within each region. Players pick a region and roll for Home State on 2D6 within the region. When a player lands on an unclaimed state, it goes up for auction (with conditions). A player can grab another state in his home region for the minimum bid; if in another candidates home region, it is a two-way auction with that candidate; otherwise all can participate. Landing on a controlled state requires paying money (more if the owner is there or it is part of a bloc of 7+ states in its region). Players can trade states and money at any time.

Players can win in one of four ways: Front Runner (majority of the 1500 total delegate votes); Regional Bloc (control 7+ states in each of 3 regions);  Key States (control 10+ of the 15 states ranked #1, #2 and #3 in their regions, including 2+ #1s); and Balanced National Appeal (control 5+ states from each of 4 regions).

After 1.5 hours, the game moves to a Convention round, where players not meeting minimum levels are eliminated, everyone gets bonus money and all auctions are open. After another 30 minutes, if no one has achieved one of the victory conditions, there is a Roll Call vote and most delegates wins.

19821,Tourspel,1987,7,1,0,2,5,90,90,,Sports ,Roll / Spin and MoveSimulation,"Cycling simulation by a small Dutch designer outfit.

Each player takes charge of a team consisting of 1 captain and 3 helpers, or water carriers. Cyclist move around a 4 lane wide track, by slipstreaming and dice rolling. Bonus and penalty chance cards help or hinder the cyclists, and the player whose captain first crosses the finish line wins the game. Alternative scoring rules allow the simulation of a tour (de France) along more numerous stages.

Like Homas Tour, there are alternative routes to pick from (in this case a fast oval, a longer road-race, and an even longer mountain stage) and there are different road surfaces to deal with. But although movement is also a combination of dice rolling, demarrages and  slipstreaming, the mechanism used to resolve dice movement is very different from the usual roll-and-move. A player rolls 4 dice after obligatory slipstreaming, and the highest amount of team members that form a queue determine how many of these dice can be allocated to riders. Only the lowest numbers can be allocated, and you have to move the highest amount of riders that the dice will allow, making sequential positioning a crucial part of the game.

The deluxe edition of this game came in a clear plastic tube with magnetic chits representing riders and a 3 color board printed on a ferro-foil mat.

19825,Connex'Oh,1992,5.5,1,0,2,2,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Maze ,Tile Placement,"Another case where a black and white design meets a 2 player abstract game.

2 players face each other across a large plastic board that contains 6x6 square plastic tiles. All tiles are divided into a black and white triangular half, with a landing space on each side for the playing piece of that colour. Tiles have a handle stuck in the middle that enables them to be lifted up, twisted round and replaced without the risk of having pieces slip off. Both the black and white player have 6 stones in their respective colours that start on opposite sides of the board. All tiles initially face the same direction, so that no two touching sides have the same colour and hence no connections exist on the board at the start of play.

By twisting tiles, players can create connections of identically coloured halves, creating a corridor along which pieces of that colour can progress. Each turn players either twist one tile in the aim to improve the available route, or move a stone along one of those routes. Players try to remove all stones in their colour from the other side of the board. The first to do so is the winner. A tile that has just been lifted gets a red marker on it. It prevents that tile from being turned by the player who is next. Additionally, it also prevents 1 or 2 neighbouring tiles from being turned, as long as a connection in that player's colour was created to the neighbouring tile(s) by the newly placed one. An elegant rule that prevents stalemates and adds another tactic to employ.

Sbastien Sjoholm copyrighted this game in 1989, but it wasn't until 1992 before it appeared with EdiGames, that since has published more of his designs. Connex'Oh won several awards (As d'Or, Cannes Festival International des Jeux 1992; Mdaille d'Argent, Concours Lpine, Paris, 1992; Mdaille d'Or, Salon international des Inventions de Geneve, Geneve, 1993) and has been re-issued in 1995 as Connexo, again with EdiGames, but this time the board was only 4x4.

The Battle of Stalingrad 1942-43 - simply the most savage urban battle in the history of man.

The map for Valor of the Guards encompasses a vast area, extending from the north of the 9th January Square to the south of the Square of Fallen Heros (Red Square) and from the west of the Stalingrad-1 Rail Station to the banks of the Volga and the critical ferry landings in the east. The hand-painted artwork of Don Petros brings the tortured landscape of the ruined city to life.

19833,Ironclad,2004,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Dice RollingGrid MovementPattern Building,"Ironclad is a commissioned game from Frank Lantz for the game design textbook Rules of Play, by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.

Ironclad is played on a 6-by-8 checkerboard, using checkers on the spaces and go stones on the intersections.  The checkers represent battling armored robots, and the stones represent arguments in a philosophical disagreement between two logicians.  These two sub-games, battling robots and arguing philosophers, are played simultaneously on the same board.  You win by winning either sub-game.

In the robot sub-game, you start with your robots on your side of the board.  On each turn, you can either move a single robot or fire on an enemy robot with all the friendly robots that are within range.  You win if one of your robots reaches the opponent's side of the board.

In the philosophers sub-game, you attempt to make an unbroken string of stones in your color from one side of the board to the other.  On each turn, you place a single stone of your color, if possible. Otherwise, you move a single stone of either color.  If neither is possible, then your opponent wins.

The sub-games interact in two ways.  First, a stone cannot be played on the corner of a space containing a robot.  Second, if a space containing a robot has one or more stones on its corners, that robot receives a defensive bonus when attacked.

The most novel aspect of Ironclad lies in the choice of which sub-game to play in.  On each turn, a player makes two moves, one in each sub-game.  However, the player only gets to decide on the move in one of the sub-games.  The player's opponent gets to decide on the player's move in the other sub-game.  So the player chooses one of the sub-games and makes a move in that sub-game, then the opponent moves for the player in the other sub-game.

19836,Sneak,2004,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,,Bluffing Deduction Party Game ,,"Sneak is a commissioned game from Kira Snyder for the game design textbook Rules of Play, by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.

Sneak is a party game for 3 or more players.  Each player is secretly assigned a role, either a Spork, a Foon, or the Sneak.  Only one player is the Sneak, the others are evenly divided between Sporks and Foons.  The goal is to figure out who is the Sneak.

The players perform a series of challenges.  Some of the challenges are private (written on a note card) and some are public.  The challenges typically direct Sporks and Foons to do different things (for example, draw a train vs draw a plane), and the Sneak gets to choose which one to do, except for certain challenges which tell the Sneak what to do.

Each player starts the game with four counters, and they can use these counters to buy information.  For one counter, a player can require another player to show the entire group one of their written note cards.  For two counters, a player can purchase a private look at another player's note card.

Players can call for a vote at anytime, and each player writes down who they think the Sneak is.  Sporks and Foons get points for guessing correctly, or lose points for guessing wrong.  The Sneak gets points when other players guess incorrectly, and loses points when other players guess right.

19838,Disposition,1974,7.375,8,0,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Racing ,Hand Management,"The board contains 2 circular tracks, 20 spaces long, and with a coloured dot that separates each two neighboring spaces. In the center is space for 3 plastic containers with a slot in the lid. Each player gets 2 pawns, 5 fuel chips in each of the 4 colours, and 3 sticks. Each player places their pawns on the board, one on each track, next to a dot of their colour. The aim of the game is to be the first player to return both pieces to their starting positions, moving one pawn round clockwise, and the other anti-clockwise.

It is a diceless game: players are in control of their own movement. Any unoccupied space can be reached as long as, and heres the twist, the player has enough fuel to reach that square. Remember those chips? For each square traveled, one chip has to be handed in. The landing space determines which colour those chips should be. Used chips are then put through the slots of the containers in the middle, spread between them at will. At the start of the game, each player only has enough chips to get one pawn round the board. To get both pieces round additional fuel need to be bought. During your turn, you can buy the hidden contents of one of the containers by discarding one of your three sticks. If you have run out of sticks and you havent got the right chips left to get home than you are out of the game.

Its a lightweight but rather clever racing game for the entire family, but its diceless movement system sets it apart from most racing games aimed at this market.

Disposition was licensed from B.L.A. and published by Berliner Spielkarten in their Spiel-O-Thek range.

In issue 9 of Abstract Games Magazine, Christian Freeling argued its superiority to Draughts.

Object: If a player has no legal move, then he loses the game. This may come about either by being eliminated or being blocked completely.

Players takes turns moving their pieces. Pieces are either men (which can only move straight forward or diagonally forward one space) or kings (which move and capture at a distance). When a man ends a move on the opponent's backrow, it is promoted to a king. Pieces capture by jumping, as in Draughts, but capture is only orthogonally, not diagonally. Capture is enforced. A player must capture the biggest number of pieces when different ways of capture are possible.

Each card depicts either the conductor or player within a brass band, with each card having a scoring value of between 1 and 7

Starting with a hand of 7 cards players try to build a band by drawing form a deck, the discard pile or requesting cards from the player immediately on their left - and then discarding. Obtaining cards from another player involves requesting cards by the colour of the jacket the player wears, though the player is not obliged to declare any musicians of that type should he choose not to do so.

The object of the game is to get a full band - that is one card for each section in the band: cornets / horns / trombones / euphoniums / basses / percussion / conductor.

When a player is confident that he has a winning hand then he can declare by placing his hand face down on the table.  Play continues among the other players until a second player declares.  At this point the players with complete bands then score their hands with the highest total winning.  In the event of a tie the winner is the player with the highest number of cards with players in the same colour jacket.

The Pirate Captain is planning a new series of robberies and is looking for a new crew by searching from island to island.

Players start the game with an equal number of pirate counters.  On his turn a player rolls the dice and moves the playing Pirate Captain piece 1, 2 or 3 spaces round the board in accordance with the dice roll.

If the Captain stops in front of an island on which there is at least one occupied space the player places one of his pirates on one of the free squares.  If he loses a pirate the player may then decide to roll again, or if he prefers, to stop.

If the Captain stops in front of an island on which there is no unoccupied space then the player takes all the pirates off that island and adds them to his crew. His turn then ends.

The game is over when a player loses his last pirate.  The player with the most pirates in his crew wins the game.

A running back on a motorized cart carried the ball on running plays, bursting through a line of scrimmage consisting of figures placed on a pegboard scrimmage rack. The defense had linebackers mounted on wheeled carts that were propelled by hand toward the onrushing cart to tackle the runner. Violent collisions ensued - and were necessary to bring down the runner as the cart was quite powerful. Passes were attempted by positioning receiver figures down field, followed by the defense setting up coverage. The offensive player then tried to toss a Styrofoam football to one of the receivers using a passer/kicker figure with a spring-loaded arm. If the ball hit any part of a receiver it was a catch; hitting any part of a defender resulted in an interception. The passer/kicker also had a spring-loaded leg to attempt field goals, extra points, and kickoffs.

In the basic game a murder has been committed.  Two players (or teams of two) play either black or white footsteps.  The twelve playing cards are shuffled and dealt face down to both players.  Players alternatively play a card (which contains some holes) onto the board.  The object is to cover up as many of your own footsteps as possible whilst exposing your opponents.

In the advanced game (3 to 4 players) each player chooses a role card to establish whether they are a detective or a murderer.  Before the start the 2 murderers must each decide on a board location to hide their victim.  They tell each other their location, one will be a white location and one a black location.  The detective(s), who are not told of the locations, will use the diagrams on the back of their cards to assist them identify the location of the bodies.  Each murderer alternatively places a playing card onto the board, but they must not alter the color or direction of the two hidden locations.  Each murderer will try to expose the other by changing as many of the opponents steps as possible to help the detective with their eliminations.  When a detective has one location left un-eliminated he has caught the murderer.  If the caught murderer has played one less card than their opponent then the opponent can play one more card to try to salvage a draw.  The victorious detective and the uncaught murderer are the winners.

RULES OF THE GAME (engraved in the centre of the playing surface)

The Immortal Man, who has existed 84 years, seems worthy of his Talents and Merit to become for the Close of Life, which can end only by Eternity. When we shall arrive at the No.84, we shall have gain'd all we can by this Game, but if we exceed this number, we must go back as many points as we have proceeded beyond it. 
The Age of Man is divided into seven periods of 12 years, viz. Infancy to Youth, Manhood, Prime of Life, Sedate Middle Age, Old Age, Decrepitude and Dotage. He passes through life in a variety of situations which are arrange in the order they generally succeed each other. 
This game like all others of the same kind is played with a totum, each Player spinning twice in his turn, the only difference is, that the Players cannot stop at any one of the seven ages, but must proceed as many points beyond, as they have in coming to them. Yet as they may spin at the first 2 sixes and consequently would go onto 84, which would be most improper, those who have this chance at first, must content them selves with going to the Historian at 39.

This game may be played by any number of persons at a time; but care must be taken, that each player makes use of a different mark to move with, and be provided with at least twelve counters each, and agree how much to value them per dozen. 
Let us then suppose that four gentlemen agree to play a game together, and stake four counters each. A takes red for his mark, B green, C black and D white. A begins and spins 9 and accordingly places his mark upon No. 9, which is the Docile Boy. B plays next and spins 7, but as the rules of the game specify instead of putting his mark on No.7, he must receive a counter from the pool, and carry his mark to the Orator, at No. 42. C being next in turn, spins only 2, and puts his mark on the place of the Child at No. 2. D being the last player spins 11, and goes to the Negligent Boy; but this being a forfeit, he must pay a counter to the pool and remain two rounds at No. 11 without playing in his turn. A now resumes the totum and spins 3, which brings him from No. 9 where he was to No. 12, but this being one of the seven ages, he cannot stop there, for agreeable to the rules of the game he must proceed as far beyond the age to No. 15, the place of the Assidious Youth; but instead of that he must receive 2 counters from the pool and go to No. 55, the place of the Patriot. B now takes the totum and spins 6, when being already at No. 42, the place of the Orator, he should naturally go to No. 48 but that being the age of the Sedate Man, he must proceed 6 points beyond 48 and put his mark on the place of the Vigilant Man at no 54. C's turn being but instead of stopping at this last number (according to the rules of the game) he pays a counter into the pool and goes to the place of the Songster at No. 38. D must as already mentioned also remain this round without playing. A again takes the totum and spins 2, and being before at No. 82 compleats No. 84 takes the place of the Immortal Man and wins the game.

NB. It is necessary to inform the Purchaser the Totum must be marked with the figures 1-6 and avoid introducing a dice box into private families, each player must spin twice, which will answer the same purpose.

One member of each team is given a separate list of five words. Each player given a list writes down a response for each word on the list. A player earns the team $10 for guessing the response on the first round. If a second round of guessing is needed, the players get to know how many words are in the correct response and the response's first letter. A correct answer is now worth $20.

The team that has more money after ten words plays a bonus round where one player has to guess five of the partner's responses to the bonus word.

Similarities to Password aren't surprising: not only did both games came from the same production company (Goodson-Todman), but for its last three months Snap Judgment changed its rules and set to Password.

19890,How To Play War Games in Miniature,1962,7.125,8,3.5,0,0,0,0,Wargames,American Civil War American Revolutionary War Ancient Book Medieval Miniatures ,Dice Rolling,"From the dust jacket:

Fighting battles on table tops, with miniature soldiers and model terrain features, is one of the oldest and most exciting of indoor sports. A good war game combines all the strategy of chess, all the fun of model railroading, and all the excitement and challenge of a game of baseball. Thanks to innovations in the manufacture of military miniatures, large numbers of excellent figures can now be obtained at very low cost. The result, in recent years, has been a dramatic upsurge in the popularity of war gaming.

Joseph Morschauser's How to Play War Games in Miniature explains every step in setting up and playing a table top war: how to obtain soldiers and their equipment; how to construct model terrain; how to deploy and maneuver troops; and how to fight battles which accurately reproduce the tactical conditions appropriate to any historic period from remote antiquity to the present.

Mr. Morschauser is an award-winning editor of one of America's greatest weekly magazines and a long-time war gamer. His book will introduce an exciting new pastime to thousands of older boys - and, indeed, their fathers.

19893,Blockade,2001,3,2,2,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Print & Play ,Roll / Spin and Move,"A game of luck and strategy for 2 players.

In early October
the Snoodles and Kleetches
all frolic and muddle
on kriddle-pop beaches.

Object: To get your pieces across the board and on to the other side before your opponent does.

You Need: A backgammon set.

Blockade is played on one-half of a Backgammon board, as divided by the Bar. The other half of the board is not used and can be folded under or used as a rolling surface for your dice. Each player starts the game with 16 pieces in six rows. Each row starts with three pieces in it, except the outside rows, which start with two. Each player's turn consists of the following steps: 1. Choose a row. 2. Roll a die. 3. Move pieces. The object is to 'leap' your pieces from your side of the board to the other player's side of the board and then to safety. The trick is that each die roll can only be used to move pieces on one row.

Play continues until all pieces controlled by a player have been removed from the board. The game ends immediately unless that player went first, in which case the other player gets one more turn to play. If the game ends with no pieces on the board, then the game is a draw. If one player has any pieces left on the board, then the other player wins.

Object: To be the last player with checkers on the board or to meet your special victory conditions.

You Need:

* A complete checkers set.
    * A six-sided die.
    * Some pennies.

Setup is identical to that of a standard game of checkers. Next, one player choses a character to play. Then, the other player chooses a character and starts the game. The character you pick will give you certain advantages (and disadvantages in some cases). Also, some of the players have special victory conditions. Play is identical to a normal game of checkers, except that the rules that govern a character overrule all other rules.

When your opponent loses the last of his or her checkers, you win. The game also ends if one player has met any special conditions that he or she has for winning.

19896,Word Chase,1984,6.5,2,0,2,2,0,0,,Word Game ,Roll / Spin and Move,"A Two-Player Board Game in Which Stealing is Stylish

Appeared in the April 1984 isuue of Games Magazine.

The gameboard is printed in the magazine. There are two 'tracks', an outer and an inner track, and 6 spaces where you can move from one track to the other. Spaces have either a letter, a Star (scoring space) or 'Go Again' on them. Movement on the board is clockwise. Other equipment needed: two tokens of one color, two tokens of another color, two D6 and paper and pencil for each player. Each player gets 2 tokens of the same color (which they control) and paper and pencil. Designate an area on your sheet for your list of available letters, or 'Letter List.'

Players alternate turns. On your turn, roll the dice. Move one of your tokens the number of spaces shown on one die and the other token the number on the other die.
-- If you land on a letter, write that letter down on your sheet, adding it to your Letter List. If both tokens land on the same space, write down the letter twice.
-- If you land on your opponent, steal a letter from their Letter List (it is crossed off on their Letter List and written on yours).
--If you land on a 'go again' space, take another turn after finishing your current one.
-- If you land on a star, you can form a word and score it. Form a word from the letters on your Letter List. Write the word on your sheet and cross off from your Letter List the letters you used to form your word. Words must have a minimum of 5 letters.

Score 10 points for a 5-letter word, 30 pts for a 6-letter word, 60 pts for a 7-letter word, 100 pts for an 8-letter word, 150 for a 9-letter word, and 200 pts for a word of 10 or more letters. Score a bonus of 5 points for each letter currently on you opponent's Letter List.

19897,Crazy Golf,1980,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,,Dice Sports ,Dice Rolling,"Tee Off in the Comfort of Your Living Room

Appeared in the July/August 1980 issue of Games Magazine.

The Golf Course (gameboard) is printed in the magazine along with a sample scorecard. There are only 4 'holes' on the golf course; however, you can play 9 holes by using different combinations of tee-off locations and holes. The sample scorecard has the 'par' for each hole. Other equipment needed: a golf ball (marker) of a distinct color for each player, 2 D6 and paper and pencil to keep score (you can make or copy a scorecard for each player instead of using a plain piece of paper for scoring).

When a new hole is started, each player tees-off in turn. Until everyone finishes the hole, order of play is determined by whoever is farthest from the current hole. Whoever is farthest takes the next swing. On your turn, while you are on the fairway or rough, roll both dice. You must move your ball in a straight line (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as follows: (1) the total of both dice (2) the number on either die (3) the difference between the two dice.

Playing from a sand trap has a potential penalty. Play the stroke as usual, but then roll one die again. If it is a 1, there's no penalty. A 2, 3 or 4 adds one penalty stroke. A 5 or 6 adds two strokes.

Landing in a water trap incurs a two-stroke penalty, and you take your next swing from the last space you passed before landing in the water.

When you make it onto the proper green, you must decide whether you will (1) continue to use the movement method using 2 dice or (2) use a 'putter' (move the ball one square in any direction for each putt). You must continue to use this method for the rest of the hole.

There are a few more obstacles: (1) You may not hit onto or directly over an opponent's ball (2) You may not hit onto or directly over trees (3) You may not hit your ball onto a green other than the one around the hole you are playing.

Keep track of the number of strokes it takes you to complete a hole and write it onto your scorecard. Lowest total wins.

19904,4th Street Pro Football,2000,7.70833,24,3.8333,1,2,180,180,,Sports ,Simulation,"4th Street Software Pro Football is a dice, chart and card simulation of NFL football. The game combines detailed individualized players cards for every player position with specific offensive and defensive play calls to generate action.

Here is a brief description of play from the manufacturer's web-site:

First, lets set the scene. Its the first round of the playoffs, with Miami hosting New England. Miamis got the ball on the New England 37 yard line with 4:23 to go in the fourth quarter. Theyre down by a touchdown.

The Miami coach selects a passing play, F1 Cross (F1 is the flanker, and hes running a crossing pattern over the middle of the field).

The play card is essentially a 3 x 5 card filled with information about the ensuing play. The larger letters (s, T, G, C, Q, etc.) represent offensive players. The boxes and ovals represent defensive zones which may or may not be occupied by one or more defensive players. The lines represent the routes each of the offensive players takes after the snap. The red line represents the route taken by the intended receiver. Blue lines represent secondary receivers, while black lines represent the motion taken by blockers.

The smaller letters are the player ratings, which are followed by a number or range of numbers, which correspond to a 20-sided (d20) die.

So lets roll the dice and see what happens

20 sided die = 2 
12 sided die = 6
2 six sided die roll = 1+3 = 4

The d20 roll (2) tells us what the matchup is. In this case, the left guard is matched up against the defender in the zone opposite him (in this case, the right defensive tackle).

Here are the two players involved on the play:

J. Buckley [G - Miami 97]
Hen. Thomas [DT - New England 97]

The offensive players D rating (pass blocking) is now compared to the B rating (pass rush) of the defensive players. These two ratings are subtracted (6  4 = 2) and compared to the d10 (in this case, a 6 was rolled). Since 6 is larger than 2, the defensive player wins the matchup.

Now, the two d6 are added together (1 + 3 = 4). Since Thomas won the matchup, we look under his B column across from 4 and find the result code of 47. This is a sack! (Result codes are listed on the fieldthere are approximately 90 of them.)

Thats it! All other plays are completed in a similar fashion.

You have some sausages to eat, and a bone to chew on. You have even picked out a couple of comfy spots where the grass is a bit longer. Perhaps after lunch you might take a little nap.
It's great being a dog!
Now imagine there is another dog sniffing about on your lawn. It looks like this other dog might want to muscle in on your territory. Oh No! Now it has sat down in one of your comfy spots! This is war.
But how on earth could you, a humble dog, show the intruder that this lawn is yours, and yours alone?

Take control of the lawn by weeing in strategic positions. Use your wee to claim ownership of bones, sausages and comfy spots, and ensure that in the end you dominate the lawn, so the other dog will clear off.

Object: To demolish your opponent's vehicle while keeping yours intact.

You Need:

* A standard-sized chess- or checkerboard
    * Two dice
    * Two pawns or other markers
    * Scrap paper (to keep track of damage)
    * A set of 64 Yield! tiles (available for download on the game's website)

The board is made up of tiles that represent road sections. Players take turns laying tiles on the checkerboard until all the tiles have been played.

Gameplay consists of moving your pawn (your vehicle) around the board, attempting to collide with the other players under circumstances which will damage their vehicle and not yours. When you receive ten points of damage, you are out of the game. The last player remaining wins.

Zetema is played with a 65-card deck consisting of the standard 52 cards plus an additional two through Ace in one suit. Each player's objective is to reach a certain number of points. These can be scored by discarding assemblies (five cards of same rank from the hand), completing tricks (five cards of same rank on the table), setting up marriages (king and queen of same suit from hand and table combined), or revealing flushes and sequences (six cards of same suit or sequential rank). With four or six players the game is played in two teams.

19920,Wordwild,2005,5.66667,24,1.5,2,5,45,45,,Card Game Real-time Word Game ,,"Launched Essen 2005, Wordwild is a wordgame with a speed element. The game comes in a tin box and contains: 224 cards, wooden pieces, 1 plastic chip and rules.

The game is designed in German and English. One deck has German and English topics, such as Clothing, Holidays, Politics, Ancient Egypt and so on. The deck is written in German and English. The other deck has some letters to start a word and some letters to end a word. So a card might have PE... and ...ING, or it might have T... and ...E and so on. Players have six of these cards face-up in front of them. Three of the Topic cards are dealt up for all to see and then a letters card is turned up.

As quickly as you can, you make a word fitting one of the topics, starting or ending with a card in your six, and starting or ending with the table card. That is, if you use one of your cards to start a word, then you use the ending from the table card. Or the other way round: if your word starts with the table card, then you use an ending from one of your six.

The game has two decks for the letters, one in English, one in German. That way, you get the right kind of starting and ending letters to suit your language.

Players put markers on the Topics with a correct choice, and flip their card they used (worth one point), and draw a fresh table card. When any Topic card gets a third marker, that player gets the Topic card face down (worth three points) and a fresh Topic is drawn. When any player is down to one letter card, there's a special speed round, then the players reset their cards. The game ends after the third speed round.

It is a simple game idea and yet very challenging to find words and then find how to fit them to the letters available. But after a while, you can get into the flow and the game moves very quickly.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME
The object of the Q game is for each player to make a path of the specially designed pieces from the centre of the board to the two opposite ends. Of course, it's not as simple as it sounds. Your opponent will be trying to block you all the way! There are three different levels of game, Standard for the very young, Advanced and Tournament. The game grows increasingly complex as new pieces with special properties are added at the Advanced and Tournament levels.

THE GAME
The quality is superb. Each game includes 106 pieces, a velvet bag, a game board, a book of rules, 4 racks, a score book and a timer. The board is strong, the playing pieces and racks are chunky and solid, and the velvet bag lined in satin is quite special. The Q game is designed to be used again and again and to last for many years.

WHAT'S IT LIKE TO PLAY THE Q GAME?
It's Fun! Addictive! Competitive! Sociable! The Q game requires strategy, logic, cunning and a little luck. It's easy to learn and you won't need a dictionary or a degree to play it. Every game is different and presents a new set of challenges. The more you play the more expert you become and the more challenging the game becomes.

The game play is somewhat like a cross between Go, Chess and Backgammon. Players may make multiple moves per turn (up to 12 when using dice). There are two ways to win the game. Players may move their opponent's pieces as well as their own. Players can re-claim captured pieces (when playing with dice). The game can also be played without dice as a pure abstract strategy game - suited to advanced players who are interested in a deeper more serious game.

In summary, the sport of Buzkashi involves skilled horsemen who attempt to pick up a carcass (called the Boz) from the ground and then ride free of the other horsemen without allowing the Boz be taken away.

Components: A circular board (made up of concentric circles which are in turn divided into rectangles to form the spaces); six playing pieces for each player (consisting of four attendants, one Chapandazan - a champion Buzkashi rider, and one Khan - the Chapandazan's sponsor); a pair of six-sided dice for each player; and a supply of poker chips or other markers used to track each player's score.

The goal of the game is to move your Chapadazan to the Boz to take possession of it (grabbing it away from another Chapadazan if necessary) and get free from the rest of the riders or move off the playing board.

This game was an entry in the 2005 Buzkashi Game Design Contest held here on BoardGameGeek.

Teams of horsemen try to gain control of the Boz, traditionally a decapitated sheep or goat, and carry the Boz around a flagpole set away from the center of activity, and then bring the Boz back to a set circle or goal area on the field called the Hallal. A successfully deposited Boz within the Hallal scores a point for that team.

Objective: Score the most points by dropping the Boz into the Hallal after two halves of play. If at the end of the second half, there is a tie for most points, then a freeforall period is played with everyone (even those who did not have the most points), with the first player to score declared the winner of the game. Otherwise, the team with the most points at the end of the game wins!

Components: 40 action cards; 24 combo cards; 120 rider cards (5 chapandaz and 25 pakir for each of the four teams - Turkmen, Mongol, Tajik and Nuristani horsemen); one six-sided die; a Boz marker; and a Flagpole marker.

Each rider has individual statistics for strength, speed, tactics, and boz skill. Further, each team is designed to have a different flavor; the Turkmen tend to be the fastest riders, the Mongols the strongest, the Nuristani the best tacticians, and the Tajik are pretty well-rounded.

19955,Chewzacookie,1964,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,,,Roll / Spin and Move,"Chewzacookie is a game that appeared as a two page magazine insert for McCalls magazine in September, 1964. Players draw punch-out cardboard chits (substituting for a 1-5 die roll), move their tokens around the board, and chow down on Nabisco cookies. The first player who reaches the end space by exact count gets the bank of five cookies -- one of each type shown in the game.

Some of the cookies featured may have undergone name changes and variant expansions, but they all remain in the Nabisco line: Vanilla Wafers, Nabisco Chocolate Chip Cookies, Fig Newtons, Oreos, and Lorna Doones.

There is no explicit rule declaring a winner. Presumably the winner is the player with the most cookies in hand (or consumed), but one might also assume that Nabisco wanted all the players to feel like winners for getting to eat their cookies. (Of course, the ultimate loser is the person who had to furnish all the cookies for the game!)

19956,Slots'n Dots,1989,4.5,2,0,2,6,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Memory ,MemoryPattern BuildingPattern Recognition,"Slots'n Dots is contains 48 plastic chips (six each of the numbers 1 through 7, portrayed with different numbers of dots, plus three each of single-ring and double-ring chips).  It is played on a special plastic board which contains seven recessed areas that allow a chip to be placed face-up and six slots that hold a chip invisibly.  The board is arranged with a single recess at the center surrounded by an alternating pattern of recesses and slots.

There are several different ways to play:  a basic game, two levels of advanced play, a children's version, and a variety of optional rules.  All follow the same basic theme:  after the board is set up with chips in some or all of the recesses and slots, players take turns drawing a chip for the center recess and looking for patterns of chips (generally lines or triangles) containing runs of consecutive numbers.  When a player spots a pattern on his or her turn, he or she takes one of the non-central chips from the pattern and moves the chip from the center of the board into the vacated spot.  If the player cannot find a pattern, the center chip is instead taken off the board as a dead chip that can be played later in place of a random draw.  Single-ring chips are wild, and double-ring chips allow other chips to be stolen from opponents.  The game ends when the chip supply is exhausted and no more dead chips can be played -- at this point, players add up the values of the chips they collected and subtract any dead chips to determine to winner.

In the more advanced variations of the rules, legal patterns and playable areas of the board change so that slots are used more and more, adding a stronger element of memory to the game.

19959,Millennium Chess,1997,5.25,4,4,2,2,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Grid Movement,"Millennium Chess is played on an 8 by 15 size chess-board, and each player controls nearly twice as many pieces (two queens, two kings, four bishops, etc.). Most of the rules of the game are the same, with some special rules regarding capturing and check-mating the kings. A player's first king can be left in danger of capture and actually captured - once the first king is captured, the remaining king can then be put in check and check-mate as in normal chess.

From the brochure and web-site:

Millennium Chess was developed to improve the skills of the average to excellent chess player. This is accomplished by maintaining the basic dynamics and structure of the of the game, while increasing the number of strategic moves.

By expanding the size of the battlefield and increasing the number of pieces, a chess player's mind is forced to accept a greater strategic load. This subconsciously builds one's 'chess muscles'.

19965,The Approved Little League Baseball Game,1964,5,1,0,2,2,60,60,,Sports ,,"This game consists of a gameboard with a baseball field on it, and a spinner in the centerfield corner of the board.  There are also four baseball players used to represent the batter and any runners.  The spinner points you to several tables located around the edge of the board.

The player who is the pitcher spins the spinner to determine what kind of pitch will be thrown (fast ball, slow ball, curve ball or knuckle ball).  The batter then decides whether or not he wants to take the pitch, or make a swing at it.  If he takes the pitch, the result can be either a ball or a strike, though the pitcher could also incur a passed ball, wild pitch, balk, or a hit batter.

If the batter swings at the pitch, he spins the spinner to get a numerical result, and reads the result based upon the pitch thrown.  This result could be either a strike, a ball, a foul, a hit to the infield, or a hit to the outfield.

If the result is a hit, the batter spins the spinner again and reads the result on the appropriate infield hit or outfield hit chart, with the result being some type of base hit or out.

With runners on base, the batter can also announce to attempt a stolen base or a sacrifice.  In this case he, surprise!, spins the spinner and reads from the appropriate chart.

Continue this way, playing nine innings of regulation baseball.

The game concerns filling your cabs up with tourists arriving from the a nearby cruise ship.  You compete with the other players who also have their own cabs.

Points are scored by loading a cab with a single color of passengers and successfulling leaving the loading dock (other players may have an opportunity to steal your passengers before you leave, since you may only leave when your cab is full).  However, the number of points scored is determined at the end of the game, when the most rare color of passenger is worth more points than the most common.

Your hand consists of cabs which you may play onto the loading dock.  The loading dock consists of everyones yet-to-leave cabs and any tourists waiting for a ride (either standing outside, or waiting inside a cab).

Whenever passengers are loaded into a cab, at the end of the turn new passengers are added.  The same color passengers always stand in a group outside together and may not be broken up later.

Passengers may be loaded into a cab if the entire group can fit within the remaining space inside the cab.  Additionally, when one is loading a group from the dock of a particular color, one can choose to also steal a group from a waiting unfull cab provided all passengers can fit within your cab.

Once a cab is full it immediately leaves.  If a group grows larger than 8 (the size of the largest cab) it is discarded (i.e. leaves on a bus).

It gets rather crowded on the icebergs. Quite fast, some of the icebear friends glide down to the the water. But, with some skill you can help the friends get the best spot in the sun. This requires a steady hand, to place your cards firmly on the ice berg.

The game consists of a deck of cards, some counters and two icebergs (three dimensional cardboard stands). At the beginning of each game, each player receives a number of cards, of which three are face up. Each turn a player tries to get rid of one of his face up cards. This is done by placing the cards on one of the icebergs. How exactly the card is to be placed is determined by the animal depicted on the card. Some cards need to be placed against a side of the iceberg, others need to be on top, etc. In some cases, it is not the card that needs to be placed, but a cardboard counter (using the card as a tool).

If a player succeeds in placing his card, he draws a new card from his pile and puts it next to his other face up cards. However, if one or more cards fall down while he tries to place his cards, half of the cards that have fallen down are shuffled and put on his draw pile (the others are discarded).

The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.

Players have factories to produce Heavy Bombers, Medium Bombers, Day Fighters, Fuel and Munitions, Tanks and Air Defence - and these are used to attack the enemy's armies, factories and convoys.

Initially a list of program points need to be filled in. The game starts with picking 7 tiles (from 150 available). These tiles represent persons in the government.

By placing at least 2 adjecent tiles (they are numbered from A1 to J15, thus a total of 10 * 15 = 150) a faction appears.  If a faction is adjecent to another faction the smallest faction is absorbed. Voting is then performed. 
Depending on the size of the factions a program point is selected or cancelled, so the player with the biggest factions has more chance for succeeding his points.

By getting cards extra points can be gained, same for each placed tile to an owned faction.

The players help each other by clever laying of tiles to make Maps or Areas of Consciousness so the Forces of Light will be in the majority. Each player has an JSCH as a personal E.T. Contact whose spiritual help they can call upon to prevent the Evil Forces from ruling Earth.

THE MAPS that develop as tiles are laid are not geographical areas with territorial boundaries, but rather more fluid depictions of how cultures spread regardless of national boundaries.

THE EVIL FORCES, symbolized by Dark Shields with a drop of blood shaped like a bomb, represent such Forces as violence, greed, hate, confusion, political and religious conflicts... the destructive elements.

THE YELLOW SHIELDS with the UFO-like Eye represent the Forces of Light, which you can interpret as Goodness, Compassion, Living according to Creational Laws... all that is positive in humans.

WHITE SHIELDS represent the Uncommitted, who will convert to Dark or Light, depending on which Force is in the majority in that Area.

It will take all your strategic skills  the timely help of the JSCH to save Planet Earth from the destructive Forces that threaten us all.

Thus, in this game, your 5-in-a-row can include wilds.

Players roll a single D6 and move any one of their markers the total count on their turn.  Markers can land on top of one another, and, in so doing, trap opponents' markers, or their own until the top one is voluntarily moved off the stack.  If a player's marker lands on the white spaces (in the water), that marker is turned into an island (green side up) and is stuck there, able to be used as a stepping stone for other players, for the duration of the game.  The marker(s) that reach ELDORADO are stacked in the order that they reach there.  Final score is highest for the top marker (last to arrive) and decreases for those lower in the stack.  The winner is decided by the player whose marker(s) score the highest total points in the final stack.

20076,Gergovia,2006,7.55625,48,3.25,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Ancient Expansion for Base-game Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"A Great Battles of History Module (GBoH) for Caesar: Conquest of Gaul.

[From the GMT WebSite]

For those of you who cant stand someone who wins all the time, here is an opportunity to game one of Julius Caesars rare losses. The Battle of Gergovia was Caesar's failed attempt to wipe out the threat of a large Gallic uprising by isolating and defeating a gathering of the Arverni, plus several other Gallic contingents, under their new chieftain, Vercingetorix.

The Arverni had taken a defensive position in the hill fortress oppidum of Gergovia, a position somewhat similar to (but much smaller than) that that they would take at Alesia but, given the surrounding terrain, a bit more difficult to take.

In a series of short battles that took place mostly below the walls of the oppidum, and probably helped by a topless show from the Gergovian women (really!!), the Gauls managed to drive off the Romans, inflicting on Caesar his only serious loss in his 8 year campaign.

The Gergovia module comes with its own map but uses, mostly, counters from Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, along with a few extra tribesmen counters. It also uses the rules for C/CoG (preferably the 2nd edition (2006), but the original version will work just fine.)

And while the hilltop oppidum of Gergovia is fortified, Gergovia is not a siege assault (for the most part), but a rather disconnected series of attacks, feints and mistakes. The terrain is not overly conducive to linear combat, the approach to Gergovia being fairly steep and somewhat rocky, but Caesar, Roman that he is, has already built two camps and a sunken trench for easy movement.Gergovia is a tough game for either side, as the options and possible strategies are multiple.

Designed by GBoHs own Caesar (Julius, not Sid), Richard Berg and Developed by his House Labienus, Al Ray, Gergovia contains one full map, one small sheet of counters, and all rules needed for the battle (as a scenario for Caesar: Conquest of Gaul).

Expands:

In 2006, when Game Show Network aired its series of the 50 Greatest Game Shows, the inclusion of Studs as #47 (despite not showing any footage) led to flabbergasted game show fans calling it Freaking Studs and wondering how it could have possibly ranked higher than Blockbusters and Treasure Hunt; while far from the only shocker of that series, it's the only one relevant to this entry.

Each card can be visited three times; the first player to find a treasure gets the most points.

The score is kept on a track around the board. Several spaces on this track have a symbol; if a player lands on such a space, they may discard one of the treasure cards.

The winner is the player that is the first to reach the end of the score track.

Ships with a given total mass can protect a ship whose mass is less than theirs making that ship harder to hit.

The game system is downloadable (PDF) and includes the rules, board and cards.  There are a number of optional weapon systems so that custom designed ships can be developed to fit a particular sci-fi genre.

From the publisher's Web site:

Each player has a control sheet which has 3 rows on it (Ranks) each rank also has a protected area.

Each ship is placed in a rank 1, 2 or 3 dependant on the setup conditions of the scenario.

Each turn the players roll for initiative ( for their side not individual ships), and then alternate activating ships.  Activation consists of moving (if you want to) and firing (again if you want to), you can fire and move or move and fire.

Firing procedure is very easy and is based on the ranks you and your target are in (add them +1 if the target is protected) + bonuses for special abilities.  You declare how much damage you wish to do and roll to hit , the defender applies defenses and marks any remaining damage.

Once all ships have been activated (or all players defer twice consecutively) the turn is finished and any end of turn effects are applied.  Then a new turn starts....

Unfortunately there are a lot of false trails which make the job more difficult than it could be.  Besides this one must constantly work out what it is the other players are trying to do.  Who is it then who will turn out to be the most successful Counter-espionage Chief......?

SCHNAPP DEN SPION, or Counter Espionage is a memory and tactics game for 2 to 6 players from Age 6.

The game has 60 agents cards which are laid face down on the board.  These represent either the agents that players are trying to capture, or false trails.  There are 10 cards in each colour of which 3 are agents and 7 are false trails.

Each player attempts to capture enemy agents (any agent that is not the same colour as the player's counter).  When less than 6 people play all agents, including those not directly involved in the game, are considered to be enemy agents.  A player can theoretically capture 15 agents - there are 18 agents in the game, 3 of which are friendly.

Players take it in turns to look secretly at two cards, returning them face down to the space they came from  In so doing the players try an identify and memorise where the agents are on the board.  When a player has discovered the location of a sufficient number of enemy agents he can, when it is his turn, place one of his three capture cards in the middle of the board.  He does this instead of looking at two cards.  In playing the capture card the player is allowed to take any number of agent cards from the board.  He lays these cards face down in front of him without having a look at the front of the cards.

A player that has used a capture card may, before his turn ends, move up to three cards, one at a time, from where they are to any unoccupied space.  This is done without looking at any of them.

Play continues until players have used up their capture cards or believe there are no more secret agents to capture.  At the end of the game all the players turn over their agent cards and scores points as follows:

Captured enemy agents + 3 points
Captured own agents -  3 points
False trails (own or enemy) -  2 points

The winner is the player with the highest score.

There are four piles of coloured cards.  Each player receives an equal number of cherub cards.  A player spins the devils fork to determine the card category: debauched, dexterous, dramatic or despicable.  The card is read out.  The fork is spun again to determine the players partner/victim.  If either victim finds the deed too distasteful they can get out of it by surrendering a cherub card to the other player.  Bluffing is the name of the game.  A player is out of the game when they lose all of their cherub cards.  A game for consenting adults!

The arrow is then spun.  The letter it points to is the word-start letter.  The arrow is spun again and the person it points to must say a letter.  This letter must follow on from the word-start letter.  Play continues until a word is finished that cannot be extended.  If a player is successfully challenged (a finished word can still be extended) the player forfeits a knowledge card.  The spin card is used when a player cant think of a way of extending a word or bluffing.  When a player loses both their knowledge cards they become a non-entity and are out of the game.  However they still play a role.  Non-entities must be completely ignored.  If a surviving player acknowledges a non-entity they lose a knowledge card.  The winner is the last survivor.

20119,Monstererbe: Das Testament des Doktor F.,2005,8.03529,17,3.5,3,6,150,150,,Fantasy Horror Humor ,Auction/BiddingSecret Unit DeploymentSimultaneous Action Selection,"This new Berlin-based publisher will be presenting Monstererbe  Das Testament des Doktor F (Monster Inheritance  the Will of Doctor F) by Michael Benkendorf. 
The goal of the game is to awaken a monster and keep him alive. Here an atmospheric description:

The overlooked, unsuccessful and completely-forgotten-by-the-underworld Doctor F, nephew of a certain Frankenstein, has fruitlessly tried his entire life to follow in the footsteps of his famous uncle. Lonesome and bitter, he writes his last will and testament out one stormy night. He demands from his inheritors that they solve the task that he himself couldnt: the creation of an artificial human being, often labeled a monster by more ignorant folk. Only he who solves this puzzle will be considered worthy of being awarded the enormous castle and the lands surrounding it. To assist them in their quest, each potential inheritor gets a corpse, a laboratory and the help of Igor.

Setting up the laboratory, finding organs, waking up the monster  its as easy as that. You only need to keep a hairsbreadth in front of the competition. Whoever wants to be the inheritor of Doctor F needs skill with trading and auctioning, a little luck with digging, bad weather, and naturally a brain  even better would be two or three.

The players try  with the help of Igor  to find the necessary vital organs as quickly as possible in the graveyard. But a lightning rod and a big switch are required. 
And naturally tons and tons of green goo. The most important part is the brain, though. Theres quite a selection: Beethoven, Newton, Marx or maybe Jack the Ripper? 
For protection, you can always hang a couple of shrunken heads and a stuffed crocodile in your lab. But whats the use of all that if the weathers sunny and devoid of lightning? 
Then only James Watts mysterious atmospheric steam machine will help.

20127,Die Wendeltreppe,1992,0,0,0,2,4,60,60,,Fantasy ,,"A self-experience game for children and adults with tarot and oracle elements

This game is a travel through the inner self. In this game, you are made aware of your experiences by means of the symbolicism of a fairy tale. The inner spaces of the conscious and unconscious self are represented as different storeys in a big house. The levels, from the deepest cellar to the attic symbolise the different levels of consciousness.

On the way up, a players will encounter different archetypical persons, who represent different sides from his personality. Those are the fairy-tale characters who live in the house. Connected to these characters - Dwarf. Witch, Prince, Princess, Giant, Queen and King - are different feelings. The persons will ask questions connected to such feelings.

Interaction between players occurs when the answer a player gives is not the answer others think he ought to give - in other words, when someone perceives himself different from how others perceive him. This should lead to a discussion to find the true answer (and the true personality).

Allthough the actual game is a race to the attic, this interaction between players is the most important part of the game. Discovery of self and development of social actions is the main goal of the game.

The 46 numbered cards are numbered 1-10, and there are two each of the Special cards, Skip, Reverse, Draw and Throw (Uno-like actions, with the Throw card forcing the next player to discard a card instead of having a turn). The cards 1 to 5 give the player the option to move the counter forward or backwards; the cards 6 to 10 are advance cards only.

There are three rounds. The winner of each round is the player who reaches the goal by using his last card to move the marker into the goal zone. The losing players pay the winner in chips the value of their remaining cards. The winner is obviously the player who has most chips at the end of three rounds.

The two sides of the board have the Standard and the Risky Wheel game. The Standard games goal zone is 50 to 61. The Risky Wheel game offers less leeway as the goal is exactly 50.

The name Hictas comes from the Japanese verbs to subtract and to add.

Those months were enough for the little guys to spread to nearby systems, and become unkillable - as a race.

Injurius might still have gone to the trouble of wiping them out, for surely there are no more troublesome creatures in the universe than RATZ - but his scientists have told the Emperor that these creatures, though their lives are often shortened by brutality, are effectively immortal. Barring accident, starvation or plague, these creatures don't age once they reach adulthood.

The Emperor decided to use the RATZ as test subjects for his experiments - after all, an immortal Emperor would be a great asset to the Empire. Allowing the creatures to fight in the arena is simply a bonus: any RATZ that are felled in the arena go into the Special Program, and work goes on.

This supplement brings the bar way, way down, in more ways than one: the Orx are rude, crude and easy to operate. They are faster on the ground that the Humans, have lots of hit points and powerful weapons. Orx almost never lack for Command Points, and their size and strength make them naturals in melee. These guys are off the wall, and their Skilz and Stuff reflect that: for example, who else eats Brain Candy (you have to be stupid to eat Brain Candy!), or drinks G.I. Coffee (this stuff makes Human coffee look like a hot milk toddy!)? And only Orx have the Tag Team Skill (gang up on a hapless opponent in melee!), and Athletics (Orx make physical fitness their priority).

Space Orx is not a stand-alone game. You need a copy of Injurious Games to play Space Orx.

20171,Meck Wars,2002,5.5,4,0,2,4,90,90,Wargames,Expansion for Base-game Miniatures Science Fiction Wargame ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenDice Rolling,"The Meck Wars book is a supplement for Injurius Games. You need Injurius Games to play Meck Wars.

After 5 years of arena battles, the ratings have gotten flat. The masses are getting restless, and the only thing Emperor Injurius will accept is a massive ratings sweep to bring the people back into the fold. A bright young ad executive at Mars Metals thinks of it first... Why not put Mecks in the Arena?

After the Meck War, which ended shortly before the League was formed, humanity swore they would never lose control of their machines again. These arena Mecks would be tightly controlled, highly programmed, and well sponsored by the huge corporations that Emperor Injurius had created to run the League.

After just one match, which put two squads of Mecks against each other, Emperor Injurius knew he had found a winner. The ratings were the highest ever recorded. Humanity had found its newest fad - Meck Wars!
..
.Summary from the back of the book:

It is the 22nd Century. After several years of successful gladiatorial games, Emperor Injurius has brought forth a new challenge, in the form of an old enemy, to increase the ratings of the arena battles.

Every gladiator who fights in the arena remembers this enemy. Every gladiator who dies for glory knows that it is a new battle. Every gladiator who hoped never to fight them again must face them one more time...

The Mecks have returned!

Salvaged from the battlefields of the Solar System, their metal and ceramic bodies re-built, their cold, calculating minds re-programmed, Mecks are the ultimate Corporate product.

They don't draw a salary, they take sponsorship without complaint, and they bring in the underdog viewer ratings that were sorely missing from recent human matches. The first Meck match was Meck vs Meck, but as their teams of programmers learned to refine their behavior, the Mecks were introduced against humans. Suddenly it was as if the Meck War had never ended.

You control a squad of five Mecks: the heavy Jumper leads from the front; a pair of middle-weight Spartans carries the firepower into battle; the light and fast Runners round out the team with speed only a Cheetah Suit's transmission could match.

Mecks earn Battle Honors the same way humans do, and can also gain software/power upgrades and hardware improvements. Their weapons are modular and may be switched from meck to Meck before any battle. Their command structure differs from human methods as well, owing to their networked nature. No distance to calculate for Command Points!

Meck Wars is not a stand-alone game. You need a copy of Injurius Games to play Meck Wars.

Earn rewards as battles are fought, and cash them in for skill increases and equipment upgrades. Make your team better, stronger, faster!

Injurius Games is a squad-based tabletop miniatures game, with all aspects of the game controlled by the use of miniatures, control sheets, and die rolls. The basic rulebook contains all the rules and Unit Record Sheets you'll need to play. In addition to the rules and URSs, you'll need miniatures, some d12s, a card deck, some counters (download the decks and cards from our downloads page) and some terrain to play on.

The game is based on the use of twelve-sided dice for all die rolls. Most attacks are resolved with one or two rolls of the dice. This system is based on the premise that gamers want realism, but not at the expense of gameplay and fun.

Each player is dealt 4 cards and the rest are left aside.  Next, players get a 2 minute study period to look over their cards.  When the two minutes is up, the dealer calls out Pass.  Each player passes their cards to the right.  After the pass, the dealer asks the player on their left any question from any of the cards in their hand.  If the player answers correctly, they are given the card, which they place face up in front of them (scoring it).  If the answer is wrong, the dealer scores the card by placing it face up.  Then, the player to the left of the dealer asks a question of the player to their left and so on around the table.

After all players have a chance to ask and answer a question, scores are tallied.  The cards in play are then shuffled and placed on the bottom of the deck and 4 new cards are dealt to each player.

The player with the highest score at the end of all of the deals wins.

If a player cannot move in the direction rolled, the ship is not moved for that turn. A player may also refuse to move when it wouldn't be to their advantage, or move a smaller distance when there aren't enough spaces available.

The six-sided die is numbered 2 through 5, and has a lighthouse where the 1 would go. When the lighthouse is rolled, the direction die is ignored, and the six-sided die is rolled again. This player may move the number of spaces rolled in any direction, and may change direction as often as they please. If the lighthouse is rerolled, it is counted as a 1.

There are 6 dice, each with different number of faces, and each player can use each dice only one time in a single game.
The single game works with rounds and the goal is to roll the dices with a result always bigger than the player just before. The point is that you can use the dice only one time in each single game, what means, if you use the D12, for exemple, right at the begin and dont have a good result, you cannot use this D12 again later to have better chances to beat a high result.
The winner is the player who has the better results.
But there is another trick thing: in each single game, one of the players is the Dragon. If he wins, then the Dragon wins, and the dragon receive a victory point.
The complete game is made with 3 single games, what means that every player will be the Dragon one time.
The game can be played with many more than 3 persons. To do so, one new player will join the table in each new single game, to substitute the loser of this single play.

THE GAME
Malstrom is a exciting and artful game for two to four persons. The playing time is about half an hour. At the beginning of the game 49 cards are layed out with their face down. Therewith, the hidden cards take the function of a chessfield. The goal of the game is to collect most of the couples. It is not enough, just to remember the position of each card. It is equally important to cleverly plan ahaed your own moves.

THE CONCEPT
Malstrom is published in several editions. For each edition, a, as far as possible, well thumbed book is been used. The single pages of the book are furnished with motives. Out of these pages fragments are generated, which in pairs result in collages. The motives of the respective edition are inspired by the content, the theme, or the author of the book.

Nerved river-silicics with pores, breaches and twinkling inclusions are used as tokens in the game.

The selection of these stones is determined by respective theme and in a way that an ensemble forms. In the basic version, each Malstrom is stored within a cartridge (ca. 25 cm x 35 cm x 4 cm) of 13mm thick three-corrugated cardboard. It contains 49 cards (34 cards with motives, 15 without), four river-silicics, the rules, a copy of the impressums of the used book, the number of the respective game and a signature.

Tactical Duck Combat! Just what you always wanted from Tri Tac Games.

The back woods in central Pennsylvania and a quack in the night start the nightmare of the opening days of what mankind would later call the Duck Wars. They've come from the swamps to prey on Campers and Cub Scouts. This is a crazy board game that is kind of like an RPG. Fun for the whole family as you attempt to stop the duckbilled horror.

Join the Scouts as they revenge the death of their Scout Master at the Beak of the Giant Mutated Duck.  Contains 6 X 9 Hex grid, 40 paper counters, lots of fun (beer, pretzels and other embellishments not included).

No. 1 in the Duck Trilogy

Moonshine is a free-wheeling game of deception, bold moves, and careful strategy, pitting two types of players, moonshiners and police, against each other.  In this game the moonshiners are not just out to beat the police, but must spoil other moonshine players as well in order to win.  Each player has a chance to win and must take advantage of every situation, even if it means that a moonshine player must occasionally help the police player.

20213,Colorado Railroads Game,1992,7,1,0,2,6,0,0,,Economic Trains ,Line DrawingPick-up and DeliverStock Holding,"From the Introduction in the rules:

On May 10, 1869, the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific met at Promontory Summit to establish the first transcontinental railroad for the United States.  The route taken by the Union Pacific just grazed the tip of Colorado at Julesberg and headed west through Wyoming.  Colorado, however, wanted railroads and soon got them.

In the Colorado Railroads Game, players assume the roles of the big financiers who put together the rails that roamed the Rockies.  Somewhat in the tradition of Heartland Trefoil's 1829, and Avalon Hill's 1830, players buy shares of stock in various railroads, take control of them, and build track from city to city, and city to mine.  The railroads earn money by operating trains between stations.  Player money is earned through dividends to stockholders.  Unlike the above mentioned games, the rails are drawn right on the map, and owned by the railroads who built them (As in Mayfair's Empire Builder system.)  The economic conditions change varying from boom times to depression, and mines appear and disappear at random throughout the game.

Chili, Briegel and Bernd are packing to go on holiday and each player is helping them to pack 15 items in their suitcases.

Each player receives a chip with the face of each of the 3 characters, and a number of tiles shaped like cards, planes and ships (modes of holiday transport) in 3 different colours (red, blue, yellow) are placed in the centre. There is a stack of rectangular card tiles showing different numbers of items one might bring on holiday (books, caps, sunglasses, slippers, etc.) and each player reveals one card. Players then place a chip on the items they would like to pack. Cards without chips are discarded, cards with only one chip are taken by the player who put the chip there, leaving cards with more than one chip on them. Ownership of the tiles with more than one chip are resolved by throwing a six-sided die showing the 3 forms of transport and the 3 colours. Players with a chip on the card being competed for now grab as many of the colour or kind of transport shown on the die - the player who grabs the most gets to keep the cards and the items on it.
The winner is the first player to pack 15 items in each of his or her 3 character's suitcases.

20231,Die Pyramide des Krimsutep,2005,4.39731,26,1,2,5,90,90,,Card Game Exploration ,Modular Board,"In this game the players take over the roles of archeologists who are exploring a pyramid. Their goal is to find canopic jars and, ultimately, treasures. The first player to find and secure his treasure wins the game.

The pyramid, which is about to be explored, is built with the help of cards. All of these cards are placed face down in a 6x6 grid. Around half of the grid is built by light cards which cannot hide jars or treasures, the other half consists of darker tiles and are placed deeper inside the pyramid. Every player can spend 5 movement points. It costs 2 movement points to move through an undiscovered tile, but only one movement point to walk across a discovered tile. Players are not allowed to move diagonally and must always show their opponents the way they wish to take. Although moving through discovered tiles is faster, it can also be less ahdny and dangerous as you might not only discover a simple corridor but also a trap. Cards are used to move, look at undiscovered tiles or attack your opponents.

As soon as the first player discovers a canopic jar, the mummy awakes and starts to wander the pyramid. The mummy is moved by the different players and can be used to prevent an archaelogist from leaving the pyramid with a valuable artefact. When the mummy attacks, all items the attacked player has in his backpack are lost and returned to the pyramid.

If a player successfully leaves the pyramid with a jar, the card is taken out of the game and cannot be taken away from the player again. To prevent players from securing their treasures, other players can steal items or attack opponents to make them lose an object.

From the back of the game box:
You are on the verge of meeting the greatest challenge an archaelogists could ever be faced with:
Krimsutep's Pyramid
Legendary treasures are said to be hidden inside the pyramid, but be careful. Legends speak of a curse that will be put on anybody who dares to enter the pyramid and tries to reveal its secrets. Not only does the structure of the pyramid pose a problem to eager archaelogists, but also the pharao himself does not wish to be disturbed. 
Who will be the first to find the legendary treasures of Krimsutep and get them to safety?

Players try to stay in the game by collecting valuable card sets; in each round, the player(s) with the lowest score loses a wooden log and may have to swim. The last person still in the game is the winner.

To prepare for the game, three cards are placed face-up on the table. Each player receives three cards and a raft of three logs.

On their turns, players then swap either one or all three of their cards for the cards in the middle, trying to achieve a valuable set of cards, pass, or declare SOS if they thinks they have a valuable enough set. A round finishes if one player has three cards with value 11 (a total of 33 points), in which case all other players lose a log, or if a player declares SOS, in which case all other players have one more turn before the round finishes.

Players now compare the values of their card sets. A set of three equal numbers (other than 11s, which is worth 33 points) is worth 30.5 points. If a player does not have three equal numbers, s/he adds up his/her card values in one colour. The player(s) with the lowest score lose(s) a log.

When a player loses all his/her logs, the player swims. If that player needs to lose another log, s/he is eliminated from the game. The last person still in the game wins.

20250,Number Quest,1987,0,0,0,2,4,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Math ,Modular BoardPattern Recognition,"The Ultimate Number Game

Number Quest plays sort of like Boggle crossed with Othello/Reversi; this game is essentially a number version of its cousin, Overturn.  The playing board is a plastic tray into which nine tiles (from a set of eighteen) are placed in a random order.  Each tile has four raised pegs on it, each with a different digit (from 0-9) printed on it.  On their turn, each player must construct an equation by selecting at least three adjacent digits (digits may be adjacent both orthogonally and diagonally) that form a valid equation when the proper operational symbols are added (i.e. 347 becomes 3+4=7, 9752149 becomes 97+52=149, 678234444 becomes 678-234=444, etc.)  Only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed.  No fractions or decimals are permitted.  Equations must follow normal sequence (i.e. 97+52=149 is valid; 149=97+52 isn't)and may not contain more than one operation (i.e. 4-1-2=2 is not valid.)  A given digit may not be used more than once in the same equation, and equations must make use of the digits on at least two separate tiles.  0 may never appear by itself in an equation (i.e. 4+0=4 and 5-5=0 are invalid.)  The equation is claimed by placing plastic rings of the player's chosen color (either green or gold) around the pegs of the digits forming the equation.  After the first player's first turn, all subsequent turns must use at least one previously used number.  If necessary, the player forming the equation flips over the ring so used (rings are gold on one side and green on the other), a la Othello/Reversi.  The game ends when all 36 rings have been used, or when no more equations are possible.  Players then score one point for each ring of their color.  Player with the most points is the winner.  Although Number Quest is essentially a two player game, more can be accommodated by forming teams.

20256,Common Knowledge,1983,3.5,2,0,2,8,60,60,,Trivia ,Dice Rolling,"Common Knowledge is a Trivial Pursuit-like game, involving the rolling of dice and the answering of questions (categories: Academy, Amusement, Games, General, Dictionary, Spelling, True/False).  A correctly answered question earns players cash.  Players can also choose to make each question multiple choice(guess), lessening the monetary reward for a correct answer.  The cash is used to buy sets of books (printed on cards) upon landing on certain spots on the board which, when put together, form a complete set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.

Questions tend to be more difficult than your run-of-the-mill trivia game.  For example: L.Dombrowski of East Germany won the 1980 Olympic Long Jump with 8.54 metres.  How many metres did Ya Uudmae of the U.S.S.R. jump to win the triple jump (within 2 metres)? But questions like this are to 'weight' the game's balance and are easier if the multiple choice option has been used. In any event to guess within two metres is not that difficult.

However, the game is extremely user-friendly:lots of choices from $20 for answering the question as is, to $10 for selecting one of 3 multiple choice answers; this feature enables children to play by  making guesses if need be, which is why the game has been so popular. Children also like the use of play money as well as the multiple choice (guess) option. In addition, players can move around the board in any direction, as long as they don't backtrack. Another feature which makes the game versatile is that it gives a the choice of categories; here non-trivia types can choose spelling, dictionary or true-false, for instance. The game can be set to be short and quick or longer, by changing the objective from saving all the encyclopedia volumes to saving just one or two, or by the setting of a time limit.

Contrary to reviews, the game was not made....for Encyclopedia Brittanica: After inventing the game Norman Golledge approached the Britannica as a marketing strategy. He was the first person to secure the use of their name in such a way; he was allowed to incorporate the Britannica into the finished game and use the phrase 'Encyclopedia Britannica a source of Common Knowledge. Britannica also bought and sold 5000 games. The CEO of Atari was set to have his company make an electronic version of the game but was ousted when Atari was spun off or bought.

Golledge had 25,000 games made up and sold them out, making it a best-seller in Canada. He sold an option for film rights to Atlantis films, later Alliance Atlantis,who were on the verge of producing a television games show, when they won an Academy Award and were inundated with offers from Hollywood for drama films.

Currently: June 2015; Norman Golledge is considering an updated board game version as well as an electronic or computer version. His Cardboard Game series which was sought after by the trivial pursuit inventors is also under similar consideration. The game at the time was in final testing by Parker Brother's who decided that year to go with more electronic games. Golledge sold a baseball game to McDonald's in the 1980's which created a record then with over a million copies going through the Treat of the Week program in two days. Golledge is also working on a new game: he is an artist and a writer.

First, put in the starter numbers from one of the 100 cards using the green disks. Now agree how many one minute turns you will both take and who will start - then off you go.

It's a nail biting race to get as many correct numbers in YOUR colour as possible, during the agreed number of turns. Score for every correct number, but beware - wrong numbers are subtracted from your total.

The red filter allows for extra clues and lets better players take on less practiced friends.

In Carol's own words -

I am a Sudoku addict. It seems that Sudoku addicts are male, female, young and old. We are all hooked. This game is the next stage of the Sudoku craze - it allows players of different levels to compete fairly against each other. I love it - it's perfect for all the family and fantastic value for the money

Players are dealt five cards, face up and one, face down. Each card features a word and a letter. The word on the face down card is a player's code word. As players move around the board answering the multiple choice trivia questions, they are afforded the opportunity to trade and/or steal oppponents' or supply stack letter cards to replace their own stack of 5, face up cards, in a quest to form the code word. Once players have formed their code word with their 5, face-up cards, they proceed to a central (Grail) square and attempt to answer a final question to win the game and complete their quest.

20280,Piquet: Point of Attack WWII (1936-1945),1995,7.5,2,0,2,6,90,90,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Action Point Allowance SystemChit-Pull SystemDice Rolling,"Piquet is a style of wargame. As GURPS is to role play, Piquet is to wargaming. A system of play for ANY period you wish, the basic gameplay will fit within any period with some basic fundamental differences required by the period.

This game uses specific generic piquet cards to depict when certain event occur on the battlefield. As the author states, the future is not perfectly known. With Point of Attack WWII, compare the turn sequence of Advanced Squad Leader, where you know when each phase and subphase is going to occur, and you can plan your attack to take advantage of the rules. Imagine this sequence: I know this unit cannot move to get behind me in time to avoid me shooting 3 times at his other tank before I withdraw. In Piquet, this does not happen as you do not know when the unit will withdraw (nor the real commander on the ground)  for the unit may withdraw now when this card is drawn, or you may wait and bet that your opponent does not get those 3 move cards before you get another withdraw card. Timing is varied, thus your tactics must be sound fundamentally for you to get the results you want.(Think...What are the odds of THAT happening?) Your plan of attack must have enough concentration to avoid the nothing gets done effect.

Game includes base Piquet Master Rules, and Piquet cards. Also Point of Attack rulebook and Point of Attack specific cards. Piquet uses a unique play on the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 dice in that you change the die you roll for each type of effect. It is not a roll of a d6 add 1, it is instead of a d6 you roll a d8 as a higher die roll is better (more good things happen).

Also the use of Impetus for maintaining whose turn adds some mystery on how the game plays out. Seemingly up to chance, if you properly plan and support your troops, the tactics will be rewarded as the greater force maintains (or quality of troops, or quality of leadership also factors in) the advantage.

20293,The Battle of Waterloo,1975,5.68571,7,0,2,4,30,30,Wargames,Wargame ,Dice Rolling,"The Battle of Waterloo is a simple wargame made by Palitoy. The board is a stylised schematic representation of the battle field which has a 'Snakes and Ladders' feel to it. The units move by die roll along a number of tracks which represent historical key points/targets in the battle. Along each track there are 'quasi historical' events which can either aid or impede the advance of your forces. Some advance you nearer your goal others either send you back or eliminate the unit.

The object of the game is to have the most points remaining upon the board at game end which can be triggered in a number of ways. Different types of units are valued accordingly so artillery are worth 6 points, cavalry 4 points and infantry 1 point.

The units are plastic figures representing the forces present at Waterloo; a small head and upper torso represents the infantry, a horse head represents the cavlary and artillery are represented by small cannons.

The game consists of the board, a rules pamphlet which includes historical detail and illustrations about the battle, a die and the following pieces;

2 red Allied cannon
6 red Allied cavalry
10 red Allied infantry

3 blue French cannon
7 blue French cavalry
8 blue French infantry

A sister game in the series was also produced on The Battle of Balaclava also designed by Malcolm Greensmith.

However, these Mighty Midgets performed invaluable services, venturing out night after night to attack enemy naval, air and ground forces.  They operated in every major theater of the war, from the warm waters of the Pacific and the Mediterranean, to the frigid fjords of the Barents Sea.  This module contains 31 historical scenarios featuring small craft (American PT, German S boats, etc.), including interdependent scenarios in a campaign setting.  A special role-playing section has been included that allows players to take on the role of a squadron commander, creating battle plans that depend on the skill and morale levels of his crews for victory or defeat.
    New data and modifications to the Command at Sea (CaS) game system (small craft damage, impulse movement, etc.) are introduced in this module.  To scale down the CaS system to a level that covers damage by light weapons as small as .30 and .50 caliber machine guns took some tinkering, but the scenario design team of Dave Schueler and Bill Madison, along with the rules/data team of Chris Carlson and Larry Bond were up to the challenge.  This module is a great addition to the CaS library and significantly expands the engagements that players can now re-create.

Contents
-New rules for operating small ships
-Thirty-one new scenarios
-A Motor Torpedo Boat campaign
-New data for small ships
-Data for ships not presented in earlier modules

Note: This module is not a complete game in itself.  You must have the standard rules to Command at Sea and the Rising Sun Data Annexes, second edition or later, to play all the scenarios.

Some of these spaces are also used for the path of a dangerous comet.  Each player is dealt three cards, each listing a different planet.  This determines which pieces that player is allowed to move.  On each turn, the current player moves one planet (represented by a magnetic marble) one space, then rolls an eight-sided die and moves the comet (represented by a ball bearing) that number of spaces.  If magnetism causes two planets to collide, both are destroyed; if the comet hits a planet, the planet is destroyed but the comet remains.  When a planet completes its orbit unscathed, its controller gets to draw a new card.  At the end of the game, when all planets are orbited or destroyed, the player who successfully completed the most orbits wins.

'Roller Derby takes on all the excitement of the real sport. Each manager has a team forming a Pack. This team has four players and one Jammer.

All players on a team wear the same colour.

The game board contains a unique mechanism that causes the skaters to move side to side in a realistic way. Once the board has started to rotate, the action becomes hectic, with each player trying to get his Jammer through the Pack.

The Jammer is a single man with a magnet in the colored base. This man is controlled by a Jammer Stick of the same color. The Jammer Stick is held under the skating surface and engages the same color Jammer above. By skilfully using the Jammer Stick, that player can be guided through the moving Pack. The Jammer Stick will not control the opponent's color Jammer.'

Object is to be the first to guide the Jammer through the Pack to score the most points.
1. 25 points or more in one game
2. A match of five games (each consisting of 25 points).

Players choose a locomotive in one of four colors. The object of the game is to move your loco from start to finish along the rail of your color. The catch? The board is made up of sliding pieces with a section of each of the railroads. When you roll to move, you can either move or move the rail lengths to make your color line as long as possible (or to break up an opponents' line!) and move, depending on the die roll. First to the end of the line wins.
     Game components are interesting and colorful. Like all the best childrens games, it teaching simplified elements of strategy and planning. A pretty good game that adults might enjoy playing with the kids.

Key application of these rules is the modular movement to simulate both player moving at the same time in leiu of ugoigo systems that prevailed at the time. Sandwiched between the infantry movement was 4 separate movement phases with six different firing phases taking place after movement. Very chart driven.

PANZER WAR was designed for 1/285th miniatures in mind, but can be adjusted for other scales.
Game Scale for 1/285th is 1mm = 2 meters.
Each vehicle or piece of equipment represents one such unit.
Each miniature soldier figure represents 3 actual men.
Each turn represents from one to three minutes.

The First Edition was published in 1979; the production run of 250 units was sold out.

The Second Edition was produced in full color in 1981. A print run of about 1000 units was produced. This version came with:
1x Rules Booklet.
1x Chart Folder with common used tables printed in the two inside pages and back page.

From the rules booklet:

I. INTRODUCTION
PANZER WAR is a set of game rules simulating World War II armored warfare using 1/285th scale miniatures. Each player assumes command of an Allied or Axis platoon or company. PANZER WAR includes rules covering most weapons, troops and vehicles used during the period 1942 to 1945. Battle action is simulated in a detailed and realistic manner, but with an extraordinary ease of play once the basic rules are understood. Many things that will seem difficult in reading will become almost second nature after just a few games. Once the basics of play have been mastered players will want to include some of the more interesting and complex optional rules dealing with artillery and aircraft.

The Third Edition of the game is distributed for free on the author's website.

The rules were later used as the basis for the Panzer Command PC game by Matrix Games.

Star*Chess is a chess derivative that features a board of tesselated quadrilaterals surrounding a ten-pointed star. Each player has a general, two brigadier generals, colonels, majors, captains, 1st lieutenants and three 2nd lieutenants. The first five types move like kings, queens, rooks, bishops and knights, respectively. Of the last two, the 1st lieutenant moves like a pawn but moves two spaces throughout the game while the second lieutenant moves only one space.

20376,Word Rummy,1933,5.5,4,0,2,8,0,0,,Card Game Word Game ,Set Collection,"An early game of rummy with words.  The deck has 78 letter cards -- the entire alphabet in each color (red, green,  blue).  Each letter has a point value from 1 to 5, commoner letters with higher values.  Deal 7 cards each for 6 or less players, 6 each for 7 players, 5 for 8 players, and turn up the top of the draw pile to start the discard pile.

In a turn of the Standard game, a player draws 1 from either pile, plays words to the table, and discards 1.  Each word must have at least 2 letters, and all must be of the same color, unless it has more than 1 of a certain letter.  If the word has more than one repeated letter (e.g. refer) the second 'e' and 'r' most both be of the same color.  Words on the table may not be added to or otherwise changed.

The hand ends when a player empties his hand, or when the draw pile runs out.  Each player scores: for words on the table, the length of the word squared (e.g. 5 letters = 25 points); for words in the hand, the simple length of the word (5 letters = 5 points); and for each card in hand, the value of the card is subtracted.  The game is won at 150 points.

The Advanced game has a yahtzee-like scoring pad.  There is a row for each word length from 2 to 8, and two scoring columns.  The first word scored for each length is written in the Primary column; and further words for that length are simply tallied in the Secondary column.  After a chosen length of time or number of hands, the player with the highest Primary total wins; ties are broken by the Secondary total.

Finally, the Inverse game only scores penalties: at the end of the hand, players total the points left in their hands.  After a chosen number of deals, the lowest score wins.

OBJECT OF PLAY
During the first half of the game, the buildup, the object is to build combinations of cards, popularly  referred to as melds, and strengthen one's hand for the secong half, the tally, when players establish trumps, and tricks count for the score.  Tricks do not count in the buildup half.  They only determine which cards are drawn from the token and stock piles.

20429,Supercharge,1976,5.36364,22,2,1,2,120,120,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Dice RollingHex-and-Counter,"Supercharge is one of the four Folio games included in North Africa Quad, but also sold separately.

Supercharge covers several battles around El Alamein in North Africa in 1942. In fact there are three scenarios:


    1. Battle of Alam Halfa: A short offensive by the Afrika Korps attempting to push east (8 game turns).
    2. Battle of El Alamein: The first British attack on the German line near El Alamein (15 turns).
    3. Operation Supercharge: The big offensive that brokethrough the German lines and routed the Africa Korps (7 turns).  


The components consist of the following: a 'Standard' Rules fold-out 'sheet'(about 3-Full pages) for the game series; an 'Exclusive' Rules sheet(1-page); a 4-COLOR paper Mapsheet-(17 by 22); a set of cardboard counters(around 120). Players must provide their OWN 6-sided DIE prior to play.

On the Mapsheet are the Turn Record Track, a Terrain Key, and the set-up locations for the Units of both the 'Campaign'  'Sidi Rezegh' games. Overall, the COLOR of the Mapsheet is WHITE with BLUE-(Water/Sea, Allied 'Fortified Box', Minefield Hex-sides), BROWN-(Rough), Light GRAY-(Broken),  Dark BROWN-(Roads, Trails). The Area encompassed by this Mapsheet is the coastal road and areas south centered on El Alamein, and Alam Halfa Ridge.

The game counters are TAN-with BLACK print for Germans, TAN-with GREEN print for Italians, GREEN with BLACK print for British. Game scale is given as 1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.

One unique thing of Supercharge is that the supply rules in the standard rules game are ignored completely.

Players alternate rolling two dice and allocating markers onto a 5 x 5 grid at the coordinates corresponding to the numbers thrown. If a six comes up, it can be counted as any other number by sacrificing six points from the acting player's score, or else simply re-rolled. Players are allowed to choose in which order the coordinates are read off the dice, so that each roll (other than doubles) gives two possible placements. If an occupied grid point is selected, points are scored according to the number of adjacent grid points contiguously occupied by stones of the owning player. The game is won by the player first player to reach a pre-determined total score. (The rules suggest 177, but this can lead to extremely long games...)

The game was originally published by Gamescience/Renwal. It was re-released by Das Spiel as Saxum, with some significant rules changes.

Simple dice rolling is used to move along a board filled up with mini-games opportunities. Games such as: Poker, Horse racing, Black Jack, dices, Lucky 7...

Every game is played (solitaire) against a designated dealer, The only time you will be able to play against your adversaries is when you venture toward the middle of the board (instead of moving around the board). Then if you happen to stop on the middle space, called Pari-manie, the fun begins. You will challenge an opponent to play a mini-game with you, the wager will be the total amount ($$$) of the poorest player (of the 2 playing). The player that was selected decides what game will be played from: 

    Poker 
    Black Jack 
    Dices
    or a simple cut a card from the deck.




If the poorest of the 2 players loses, he is eliminated (losing his whole wager). If he wins, he gets to double his money (courtesy of the loser).

The unpredictable 
TUMBLEBUG 
sensational race

The tumblebugs are individually colored, small capsule-shaped objects about 1 high with a small mobile lead weight inside. The game components, apart from the lead weights and scoreboard/instruction sheet, are composed entirely of plastic. The gameboard consists of a gently meandering 4-laned track which is almost 2 long. The track is raised at one end by a 5 high stand. Above the stand is a starting gate which holds the tumblebugs prior to release.  A finishing gate located at the other end of the track is designed to shut as the first tumblebug passes, preventing the remaining ones from reaching the finish. The edges of the interior lanes are incomplete, allowing the tumblebugs to change lanes randomly.

Before the tumblebugs are released, each player tries to predict which color will reach the finishing gate first. The first player to guess five results correctly is the winner.

(N.B. game was re-released in the early 1970s in a smaller box with the distinctive string handle favored by Schaper during this phase of their history. The track came in pieces and required assembly).

Welcome to the latest chapter in the VBAM Series: the Victory by Any Means: Fire As She Bears! Edition. In these source materials we explore the exciting world of naval combat at the height of the Age of Sail. It is a time when Englands Wooden Walls kept her commerce alive and the armies of Napoleon at bay. A time when tall, proud warships prowled the vast waterways of the world, and such ships as the U.S.S. Constitution were to earn their place as legend.

For those of you who are new to either Victory by Any Means or Starboard Tack Press products, welcome! This game is modeled after the popular Victory by Any Means: Campaign Guide, and has been carefully developed and tested to fit the unique feel of the Age of Sail. By using the Origins Award (2005 Vanguard) winning Fire As She Bears! game as our tactical system, we can finally give gamers a fluid product that lets you worry about important decisions and planning of the Admiralty. For this latest source, the VBAM team has worked with Phil C. Fry, the author of the popular Napoleonic tactical naval game Fire As She Bears! to bring you a supplement which enables you to fight the war at sea as the Admiralty of a nation, subject to the whims of the crown and to generate gritty battles where sailing skills and cunning decide the fate of the battle.

This is a stand alone book that requires no other VBAM Games products to play, although Starboard Tack Press Fire As She Bears! Second Edition is highly recommended for a complete Age of Sail experience.

Northern Germany

The year is 2119.  Global warming has pushed northern Europes yearly average temperature to 27.7 C. The sale and breeding of exotic animals is one of the fastest growing businesses in the world. Breeding in captivity has become a necessity for the survival of most of the species existing 30 degrees longitude north and south of the equator. This massive area is so hot and dry that the remaining animals are simply fighting for survival and have no energy left for breeding. A massive movement to save these animals from extinction and the preservation of a living gene pool for genetic engineering has become the focus of many different organizations around the world.

Schleswig Holstein is the world leader in the art of genetically engineering exotic animals. They are highlighting and creating new traits in animals. Zebrazucht is a clinical experiment by two of the leading companies in the field of Genetics. One company genetically stripped male Zebras of most white coloration. The second company was able to genetically create female Zebras to be void of most of their black pigmentation. This six-year-old project is now in its final stages and the animals are being brought together for the first time in the height of mating season.  A special breeding facility was created to accommodate the project.

Players take on the role of scientists from both companies trying to bring as many pairs together as possible. The calculated end result should produce offspring Zebras that revert back to a more brilliantly stripped black and white color. If things go wrong the offspring might be hard to distinguish if placed amongst Holstein cows.

In this two-player game players move two workers towards each other and place a fence of their colour in that space.
Once a player has four fences of his color surrounding a corral that player places his Zebra in the space.The person opening the most corrals to unite black  white Zebras wins.

Each player receives a hand of nine cards showing either a player position (Defenseman, Wing, Thug, or Center) or an action (such as Hook, Line Change, Breakaway or Great Save) as well as a value.  Generally, players have higher values, but lack the special abilities given by action cards.
To begin play, each player simultaneously plays reveals one card for the faceoff.  After seeing the opponent's play, each person chooses two other cards to add to their play. Whichever players set of 3 cards has the highest total value has the advantage and may take a shot.  A card from the draw pile is flipped over in order to decide if the shot was on goal and what the target number for success will be, then one more card is flipped over.  If the value of the second card, plus any modifiers from players cards such as Breakaway, or by having a much higher three card value than your opponent exceeds the target number, a goal has been scored.  If there is no goal, players check for penalties (if a Hook was played) or fights (if each team played a Thug), both of which are resolved by reducing the hand size of one of the players.
Play continues with the cards in hand, even if one side is unable to play 3 cards from injury or penalties.  If at the start of a round, a player has no cards, they draw a new hand of nine (a Line Change).  Line Changes also occur after goals (for both teams) or by playing a Line Change card during a round.

Object: Establish your supremacy over all other squid cults by retaining the favor of the Squid Totem for three rounds.

You Need:

* A Squid Totem (We used a plush orange squid.)
    * A poker deck for every four players

Players, playing in teams, attempt to contol the Squid Totem by playing the highest card each round. However, if two players tie for highest card, the totem goes to whoever played the lowest card. If all players tie, the totem returns to the center of the table. Each player plays with their own set of cards, made up of one entire suit from a deck of cards. Each time a team (or the totem) wins, that team (or the totem) gets a point. The first team to get three points wins. However, if the totem gets three points, or if all cards are played without a winner, the totem wins and everyone elso loses. There are also some variants to these rules available on the website.

To play out facilities or skills you need various cards such as party book, lobbying, intrigue, catastrophe and honest work, which you get for teaching and are therefore easiest to get in the schools.

The game casts players as doctors doing their bookkeeping. They have to make sure that the numbers work out as much in their favour as possible  they can leave the cases that will incur huge costs to their colleagues. Cases are laid out  a primary diagnosis and a face-down waiting card which eventually becomes a secondary diagnosis. Depending on the difficulty level of the secondary diagnoses, a table defines the value that the primary diagnosis will have in this case. This value can be changed by other players by playing out on call cards. The next player tries to capture the trick by playing out a case with a higher value. When scoring, the waiting card for each case is turned over separately and the value adjusted for a long or short waiting time. The costs are tabulated and the gains recorded. Over the course of the game, after months cards can also be played that can ruin the best cases.

20516,Das grosse Hollywood Spiel,1995,5,1,0,3,6,90,90,,Card Game Dice Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Card DraftingDice RollingHand Management,"This is a very rare Boardgame designed by Wolfgang Kramer for a German Pay TV - channel named Premiere.

Game components:

1 Board
1 Rulebook
6 Player figures
5 Film Company disks
105 Playing Cards (15 Joker)
27 Event Cards
5 Dice

Game Overview:

The Players take the roll of filmproducers.

The Cards and disks are divided in 5 different film types:
Love, Western, Science-Fiction, Comedy and Action

The cards show values from 1-6
Every type of film could only be played on the same type of film except Jokers, which could be played on every type of film.

Every round everybody choses one type of film and draws a card from the chosen type. The Starting player can draw 2 cards.

Then he must roll all 5 dice and move forward with every single film company with exact one dice.

When a film company lands on a yello field a film is produced and starting with the player left from the starting player everyone could play cards from the same type of film and jokers. The player with the highest value on his cards gets the most points, the second... Nothing New ;)

Then anybody who played cards on this movie must discard one card and take back the others.

When all but one film company completed the first round on the board the last film company is discarded for the rest of the game.

On the point-track on the board are some special fields like
Random Events (Event Cards), Bonus Points or Loose some points, so sometimes it could be better, to produce a bad film.

Game ends, if at least one player reaches the last field of the point-track. The Player with the most points wins the game.

Four types of stones are arrayed on a 9x9 board: earthstones, suns, moons, and crowns. One player plays the suns, and the other player plays the moons. Players take turns removing stones or groups of stones from the board. A player may make one of three moves:

     removing one earthstone,
     removing one of their own stones, or
     removing all of the stones in an unbroken line between two empty board spaces.




Players score based on the type of stone removed: 1 point for an earthstone, 2 points for an opposing player's stone, and 5 points for a crown. The first player to reach 50 points wins.

The product is available in PDF format and includes rules for using the game as a MacGuffin in a role-playing game but is itself a stand-alone strategy game.

20521,Suits by Twelve,1984,0,0,0,2,4,15,15,,Card Game ,Dice Rolling,"This is a trick-taking game with fairly standard mechanics.  Players are dealt five-card hands (or equal hands of less than five cards, if the deck is nearly exhausted).  The highest card played wins a trick, and players must follow suit if possible.  Players who cannot follow suit can play a non-trump card (automatically losing the round) or a trump card (potentially winning the round, unless a higher trump is played).  The trump suit is determined by rolling a special die showing the four suits plus one side with both red suits and another side with both black suits.  When a side with multiple suits is rolled, the dealer gets to pick which suit is trump.  The trump suit and dealer change every time the deck is exhausted.

Small plastic poker chips also play a part in the game.  Players start with an equal amount of chips.  A plastic tray is kept at the center of the board during play.  At the end of every trick in which a trump was played, all losing players have to place a chip in the Suits section of the tray.  Whenever a King is played, players place chips in the Jackpot section of the tray.  Each player has a game card showing the four suits.  Whenever a player wins a trick, he or she places a special yellow Hoyle tile under the leading suit for the trick.  Whenever a player fills all three spaces under a suit, he or she wins the chips in the Suits area of the tray and the other players have to put chips into that area.  Whenever a pre-determined number of suits are filled in, the Jackpot is won along with the Suits area.

After a player has filled in a suit, he or she gains the ability to freeze the suit -- upon winning a suit for the fourth time, the player can flip over one of the tiles on his or her card.  This prevents any other player from placing a tile under this suit -- instead, the only option they have is to unfreeze the suit by flipping their opponent's tile back over.  It's possible for all three tiles to get flipped, making it very difficult for anyone else to win in the suit.

The game has no predefined end.  The rules suggest playing for a certain amount of time, eliminating players who run out of chips until only a single player remains, or playing for a pre-determined amount of time.  The play time listed in this entry reflects a single round of play, not an entire game.

At the start of the game, the board is populated with neutral brown disks.  Each turn, the current player pushes one of his or her disks onto the board using one of eight entrance ramps.  As a result, a different disk gets pushed off the opposite end of the board.  Players may shove off neutral pieces or their own pieces, but not pieces belonging to their opponents.  If a player runs out of men, then the player may use a neutral disk. The plastic game board doubles as a storage case for the pieces.

It uses an evolution of the system from his pre-gunpowder quads published through 3W (Age of Chivalry, Crusades, Sword & Shield, Henry V, Crusades II). The command system has been changed to accommodate leader character - leaders are rated as aggressive, controlled, or timid, and are likely to gravitate to an order stance that is in keeping with their character as the battle unfolds. Correct exploitation of their capability in the battle plan is important for victory.  The melee and fire combat mechanics are also quite different from the other games in the series.

The counters are nicely done, icons. The maps are DTP standard. Best of all, the rules are short, counters few, and you can set up and play and finish in an hour.

20529,Battle Cells Game Cards,2005,0,0,0,2,2,30,30,,Card Game Educational Trivia ,Card DraftingHand Management,"A strategy game on immunology and microbiology, the game includes two decks of 40 cards each. One is the pathogen deck and the other is the immunity system deck. Players can choose to attack or defend, and the first player whose deck is exhausted or who runs out of immunity points loses the game.

Called Battle Cells Game Cards, the cards do not involve mystical beings or suits like diamonds and spades. 
.Instead, they are adorned with pictures of viruses, pathogens and pills, along with facts and the classification of the each organism.
The cards were developed by a biotech company and a team of Raffles Institution students who have decided that that there are others ways to learn life sciences aside from textbooks and stacks of notes.
First conceptualised by Genecet Biotechnologies, a leading biotech company that provides education in life sciences to schools, the prototype was then passed to the RI students Melvyn Kee, Hoe Si En, Nicholas Leong and Tan Ee Kuan  to improve on.
.Said Genecet Senior Manager Mr Jeffrey Lee: Being students, the RI boys had a different perspective on the game, because we as adults don't really know what they would enjoy.

20553,Ato-Blitz War Games,1951,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Rock-Paper-ScissorsSecret Unit Deployment,"This is a Stratego-like game that's actually two games, an army game and a navy game.  Pieces are set up on a board in a manner similar to Stratego, but rather than being linear (numerical values), the units have a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  i.e. the tank unit is superior to infantry and engineers but is inferior to aircraft, artillery, and mine units.

For those who want to recreate the (army) game, the pieces are as follows:  Private, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant = 3 each.  Second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, 1, 2, 3, and 4 star generals = 1 each. Tanks=2, plane=1, Anti-aircraft/anti-tank=5. Mines=6, Engineers=6. A-Bomb=1.

Infantry take each other according to rank; infantry also takes anti-aircraft/anti-tank and engineers.  Tanks and planes take infantry and engineers. Plane takes tank, anti-aircraft/anti-tank takes planes and tanks, engineers take mines without damage.  Mines are stationary pieces that explode and destroy anything that triggers it except an engineer. The A-Bomb is essentially a movable mine that destroys every piece in a surrounding square when it explodes.

The pieces are like mah jongg tiles arranged so that the opponent cannot see what kind they are -- he just sees blank pieces advancing toward him. When a piece is attacked or attacks, it is turned over so that the face is visible.  It then becomes a known piece for the rest of the game.

We played the game in Hawaii in elementary school in the late 1950s.  There were two blank pieces included, presumably in case a piece got lost.  We sometimes used these to create two additional pieces, the brainwasher and the kamikaze.  The kamikaze was simply a flying bomb.  The brainwasher changed an opponent's piece into one of your own.  It was not possible to brainwash the A-Bomb.

20569,Space Barons,2005,6,2,0,3,5,45,45,,Economic Space Exploration Transportation ,Pick-up and DeliverTrading,"(Description based on prototype.)

Space Barons is a quick game of trading space commodities, with commodities and thematic elements found in Felithian Finance, another Tom Wham unpublished game.  The theme includes many funny elements, such as the green eggs which could hatch, resulting in a fight against the awful green things from outer space :-)

Inventory: map showing star systems and connections between them; rocket ship pawns, home base pawns, transporters (similar to monopoly houses), galactic credits (money chits), 46 spaceship card with subsidiary engine and cargo hold cards, deck of delivery cards, deck of insurance cards, two six-sided dice.

Players begin by selecting a spaceship dealer and rolling two six-sided dice, then buying one of the available spaceships.  They then build their home base (which doubles as a permanent transporter), selecting a star system from the map.  Each star system has a cost to build, ranging from 10-50, which indicates the value and number of deliveries that can be made to that system.

On each turn, players are dealt two delivery cards, which specify a cargo and three destinations, varying in value.  The cargo is automatically available at the system where the player's rocket pawn is located.  The player may keep as many cards as their spaceship has cargo holds, freely selecting between new cards and previously retained cards.  On a player's turn, they may move their rocket pawn a number of systems equal to the number of engines on their spaceship.  Upon arrival at a system specified by their cards, they are paid for the cargo.

There are no restrictions on arrival at a system.  However, to depart from a system a player must possess a matter transporter at that system, or pay another player to rent their transporter.  If no transporter is present, the player must build one on a later turn in order to move.

During the game, players choose from a limited number of special actions, such as upgrading ships, building new transporters, advertising (to receive two extra delivery cards) or simply taking money (the least appealing option).  Only one special action may be taken each turn.

Random events are included in the delivery deck.  Some of these can result in loss of spaceship or transporter, or devaluing of cargo.  A player may buy an insurance policy, partially covering the cost of losing a ship or transporter.

The delivery deck has a reshuffle card.  Upon reshuffling, an end-of-game card is added to the delivery deck.  The player with the most money when the end-of-game card is revealed wins the game.

The complete box includes also a couple of spare cards, some measurement cards that can be used to measure the size of your ear, and a c-cassette containing sound effects from the cards.

A single round of this game begins by dealing each player a certain amount of cards (10 - 16) depending on the number of players - more cards with less players. On each round every player has two goals: to get rid of all his/her cards, and to collect sets of 3+ colored cards with a same text.

During each round The first player who manages to empty his/her hand wins the round but isn't necessarily the player who receives the most points. That's because the most points are awarded from the collected sets. The winner, however, receives bonus points according to the cards still left in the hands of other players and other players get a lot of penalty from those cards. There is also a 100 point bonus awarded for a player who wins the round with only a single set on the board.

The game is played over multiple rounds which all are scored. The winner is the player who first reaches 500 points. Because the amount of points gained from a round can vary from -150 to +450 the games can last forever or only for less than an hour.

The fun part of the game is that when a player plays a card he/she must say what's printed in the card, like: Splappa dap!, Arra Argh Yargh, or Fippaditty Fappaditty Fappa daMap! It comes naturally after a few games, believe me.

The rise of feudalism saw the continuation and subsequent peak in the rise of the armored cavalryman as masters of the battlefield. Most systems were centered around this element of the army. Battles such as Hastings tended to confirm their supremacy. By the fourteenth century there appeared in various nations trained infantrymen in numbers greater than previously hitherto. Battles such as Courtrai and Crecy were the first of many battles in which the infantry were to play increasingly decisive roles. Thus we see how the feudal system of castles and knights gave way to missiles and trained infantry. By 1500 gunpowder weapons were establishing a supremacy of their own, subsequent armies became balanced professional forces which are outside the scope of these rules.

In 1909, after the disaster at the Ravine of the Wolf, the war became headline news at the same time as the Tragic Week in Barcelona. The Franco-Spanish treaty of 1912 gave Spain the zone of the Protectorate, that Spain started to occupy from Ceuta, Melilla and Larache. 
In spite of the resistance of the Moroccan leaders El Raisuni and Abd-El-Krim, the troops of General Berenguer slowly conquered the rebel territories. In 1921, the General Silvestre suffers in Annual a crunching defeat where 13000 soldiers died and Melilla was left vulnerable to the enemy. 
In 1925, General primo de Rivera disembarked in Alhucemas, defeated Abd-El-Krim and achieved the end of the Pacification of the Protectorate. In 1926 the war in Africa ended. (Translation from the back cover)

20607,No Time to Waste,1991,3.75,4,1,2,8,60,60,,Educational Environmental Political Trivia ,Co-operative PlayTile Placement,"No time to waste is a cooperative trivia-game. The central piece of the game is a clock with an arrow that starts at 12 o'clock, and than starts moving clock-wise, taking exactly an hour for one turn. Surrounding the clock are tiles that are face down at the start of the game, but that are turned up during the game (showing colorful pictures of nature) if the players succeed in answering trivia questions about environmental topics. The clock-arrow indicates how well the players are doing because if the tile-turning is ahead of the arrow the players are doing well, but if they are behind they are in trouble!
Other trouble for the players comes from wrong answers, because after a wrong answer a red card has to be turned over, which may mean that the Greenpeace ship is blocked. In case of a blockade progress on the dial is stopped (but the clock moves on!). Luckily good answers not only turn over tiles, but also give players green card that they can use to remove blockades.
The game is cooperative because everyone wins if the last tile is turned over, and everyone loses when the clock runs out.

The game is more similar to Army Chess (Lu Zhan Jun Qi) or Stratego, featuring hidden pieces and a hierarchical system of combat, where higher ranked pieces defeat lower ones: the objective is to capture the opponents flag. Like Army Chess, Gunjin Shogi requires a third person to act as umpire and resolve combat. Unlike Army Chess (and more like Hai Lu Kong Jun Qi), Gunjin Shogi includes planes and tanks.

Each player has 23 pieces, consisting of a flag, 12 officers, 2 planes, 2 tanks, a cavalry unit, two engineers, a spy and two land mines. There is a hierarchy of ranks, with some exceptions  planes naturally cannot be destroyed by land mines and engineers deactivate land mines, for instance.

The game dates to at least before the second world war (I base this on an incomplete pre-war set I was shown in an antique shop in Japan).

To play, the unit (requiring 2 D batteries) is turned on, which sets all 4 gears spinning. Then the marbles are dumped into the large central gears. Each player controls a switch that, when pressed, lowers a gate between their home gear and the larger gear, allowing marbles to pass through -- but also letting marbles pass back out to the larger gears.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to capture all 6 of your marbles in your home gear.

From the publisher's website:
The Minsk-Moscow Highway, Belorussia, 23 June 1944:
The 16th Guards Rifle Division was one of three heavily reinforced infantry divisions that were to create holes in the German lines and allow tank forces of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps of the 5th Tank Army to make rapid and deep penetrations along the Moscow-Minsk Highway. The zone of the 16th was south of the highway, and along the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad. They were reinforced with the following units: 148th Tank Regiment (PT mineroller tanks), 63rd Guards Heavy Tank Regiment (KVs), 517th Tank Regiment (FT tanks), elements of several Self-Propelled Artillery Regiments, 2nd Guards Assault Engineer-Sapper Brigade, as well as numerous towed artillery units. The Soviet forces trained as a combined arms team prior to the attack, and were well prepared. In most sectors of Army Group Center, the Germans had relatively thin lines, and most armor and heavy artillery was stripped to defend expected areas of attack. The area of the highway had seen much heavy fighting in the winter of 1943-44, and the Germans expected an attack to come in this direction. When German intelligence detected the buildup of artillery and armored forces, as well as the movement of ammunition, their reaction was to ensure forces in this area retained significant combat strength. The 78th Sturm Division, already the most powerful infantry division in Army Group Center, maintained its structure which included the 189th Assault Gun Battalion (StuG), a Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion (PzJgIII/IVs), 5th Nebelwerfer Battalion (120mm Mortars), and Army Antiaircraft Battalion 293 (mix of 88s/20s). These forces defended from probably the most dense network of mines, trenches, and bunkers in Army Group Center, including special rotating bunkers housing machine-guns.
 Years of extensive on-sight research along with vigorous play testing by the veteran game designers at Heat of Battle brings you ONSLAUGHT TO ORSHA.

					Publisher's Description

Munchkin 4: The Need for Steed is the latest expansion for the original Munchkin - 112 more John Kovalic-illustrated cards for killing monsters, stealing treasure, and backstabbing your fellow players. This set introduces Steeds, the trusty mounts of legend... Oh, wait - this is Munchkin! So these Steeds include not just the Dragon and the Tiger, but the Giant Mutant Gerbil (drawn by guest artist Shaenon K. Garrity of Narbonic), the Chicken, and Big Joe, who might be a Steed or might be a Hireling. It's hard to tell.

Hireling? Yes indeed, The Need for Steed has lots and lots of Hirelings, who look quite a bit like Sidekicks from Super Munchkin, or Minions from Munchkin Bites! Add these valuable characters to your retinue, use their special abilities, and sacrifice them without a thought to save your own skin! Or, better yet, kill somebody else's Hireling. That's the way a Munchkin does it!

Feel the need... The Need for Steed

The aim is to be the last player to be able to move. Even if one cannot move at some stage of the game if your way is subsequently cleared you can still move then.

Aki Jarvinen has posted cards and rules for GameGame 1.0 which he pitches as an attempt to do for games what Understanding Comics does for comics: that is, to provide insight into the nature of games in a game, in the same what that Understanding is both about comics and a comic.

Thus, his cards are things like Goal and Environment and Victory/End Condition. Theres both a coherent set of rules for determining victory and a roleplaying element: players must improvise what the game they are creating is like, e.g., describing what their Victory/End Condition isbut they can only have one if they have the relevant card.

Version 2.0 recently became available at the website below.

There are three types of guns - field, medium, and heavy with each best suited to certain roles.  For Messines the addition of mines makes initial set up and play a real chess match.  The key to victory is correct deployment and effective use of reserves.  For the Allies, one of the key decisions is how much to bombard.  It is very effective but it also destroys the drainage systems of the area and leads to a quagmire that with eliminated possibilities.  For the German player, commitment of reserves is the key.  He has to guess correctly at the main points of attack by the British player before they have sufficiently evolved to make the attack plan apparent.

20737,JoBa,2003,6.75,1,0,3,8,0,0,,Card Game ,Betting/WageringTrick-taking,"This trick-taking game is played with a standard deck of playing cards.  Each game, a pair of dice is rolled.  The first die determines how many cards are held in each player's hand (1-6); the other die is special and determines the trump suit.  The second die may come up no trump (there is no trump suit) or no suit (suit doesn't matter, only face value).  Chips are used to keep score.  Players must ante up before each hand, and the pot is won by the first player to reach eleven points (or to have the highest score after four hands).  Scoring centers around the fact that at start of each game, players use bidding wheels to predict how many hands they can win.  Penalties are applied for guessing incorrectly, while guessing correctly and winning all tricks in a hand can lead to an instant win.

The object of the game is to score as many points as possible, by completing simple sums. The first player lays a number card down and subsequent players have to complete the sum. The player completing the sum takes the three cards as their trick and starts the next round. Sounds easy? Well maybe! What happens if you cannot complete the sum? You have to pick up a spare card and wait for your next turn. This game can be played by people with all levels of ability and in our testing, we found some people with devious minds who tried to stop others winning tricks. I'm sure you wouldn't do this! It's fun, but make sure number isn't up by having a handful of cards at the end.

The Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as Custer's Last Stand, was the epic fight between a massive combined force of Plains Indian tribes and the 7th United States Cavalry under the command of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The battle was the most famous event in the Indian Wars and was a crushing victory for the Indians. Custer, already famous for his Civil War exploits, became an American folk legend. Little Bighorn was the last great victory for the Sioux and Cheyenne. Defiant and proud, they were determined to preserve their way of life but within a year they were broken and defeated by a nation swept up in the emotions of the Centennial and bent on revenge for the death of an American hero.

The Battle of the Little Bighorn is the third game in the Indian Wars of the American West series.  This game also includes the Montana column led by Col. Gibbons.  This column was the third column in the field within General Terrys campaign plan.  Crooks Wyoming column was the other part of this campaign, and included in Volume II of the series, The Battle of Rosebud Creek.
The Montana column includes Col. Gibbon, the 7th Infantry, 2nd Cavalry, and Lows Artillery Battery of Gatling guns(?) and a 12 lb howitzer.  Players may now explore the possibilities and capabilities of these guns, and what effect these forces could have had on the outcome of the battle.  Scenarios included the historical game, the Montana columns arrival, assigning the Gatling guns or the 2nd cavalry with Custer. Is this last line correct?
The new expanded maps (from the original DTP version), allows for the relocation of the Indian village, the arrival of the Montana column, and if Custer had waited for Terry or was delayed because he took the Gatling guns.

The 64 card deck uses authentic bw illustrations from contemporary explorations of the nineteenth century, which lend the game a strong theme. The cards have simple German text. The cardstock is laminated but flimsy, and while the production is good for a first release, gamers may expect better. However, the price at Essen 2005 was only 4 which was fair.

20838,Splat!,2005,4.125,12,2.5,2,7,30,30,,Card Game Fighting Humor Party Game ,Dice RollingStorytellingVariable Phase OrderVariable Player Powers,"The Birthday Party has not been going well. The soup was lumpy and the main course was stodgy and overcooked. Now dessert is servedthe table is laden with Chocolate Mousse, Rice Pudding, Cherry Pie, Fruit Salad and so much more. The guests start to grin wickedly

The object of Splat! is to furiously flinging food at other players while dodging food they are throwing back at you. The more food that hits you, the messier you get. At the end of the game, the cleanest players are allowed to think that theyve won.

The game uses three types of cards:

Food Cards : Each food card has a special power which takes effect when the food is either eaten, or is thrown at another player and hits.  Some of these powers are long lasting while others are instant (e.g. the banana split is vitamin fortified and so increases a players hand size, while the revolutionary cupcakes contain added additives which force you to throw all your food at other players). Food cards are either green (generally beneficial powers) and red (generally not beneficial).

And Then Cards : Event cards which can be played during the food throwing process to impact the course of the game.  These cards act as interrupts which provide much of the interactive story telling character of the game (e.g. Amy throws Birthday Cake at Clare but Bob catches it and throws it back at Amy on his next turn). These cards can also be played as dodges to avoid food that is thrown at you.

Object Cards : Throughout the game players may also stand in front of objects (e.g. The Children, The Gnu, Uncle Harry or The Mirror).  If a player standing in front of an object dodges then the food hits the object instead and the thrower gets yelled at by either the Host or the Hostess--forcing them to discard all their And Then cards and eat a food (if they have one).

Each player has a 'You' card with 5 hit locations--when food hits someone the thrower rolls to see where (Head, 2 x Arms, 2 x Legs, 1's miss).  Food which hits a location that is already messy replaces the previous food.

The Butler (Jeeves) also has a hit location card--players may choose to throw food at him through the game and in addition any food that is thrown which does not hit a player or an object may hit Jeeves instead.  Once Jeeves is completely covered with food he chases the players out of the house, ending the game.

Splat! is a reworking of Ed Carter's 1992 food-fight card game, Kersplatt!

The object of Ice Pirates is to sail through the frozen waters of Conception Bay in order to find and dig up the Pirate Admirals treasure and stash it somewhere no other pirates (your opponents) can find it.

Conception bay is laid out as a board of cards with Bell Island in the middle and named ports around the outside. Each port offers a particular ship upgrade that will assist players in their quest to find and keep the treasure (e.g. Cannons at Harbour Grace, Ice Breakers at Cupids Harbour, Telescopes at Pouch Cove).

The rest of the board starts the game face down--hidden in the bay are three lost islands (where you can find treasure maps) and Kelly's Island where Peter Easton (the Pirate Admiral) had his secret base and (according to legend) left buried treasure when he left for warmer climes. The first player to find, or steal all three treasure maps and reach Kelly's Island gets to dig up the treasure--at which point the game switches to a treasure run with every other player attempting to steal the treasure off them.

Most of the bay cards contain icebergs, which block your movement if they come up in the wrong places, and three shipwrecked mariners who will join your crew if you find them and rescue them--increasing your fighting strength.

The game uses a deck of cards, comprising: 75 bird cards (3 of each species), 6 Hazards, 6 Protection cards and 1 Appeal card.

6 cards are dealt to each player at the start of the game. The players then pick a card from the deck (or discard pile) and then play. Sets of species are built (Male, then Female, then Young) and a completed set forms a trick and is put to one side. Sets are built up in the spaces along the edge of the board facing the player; the species has to go in the appropriate habitat (as indicated on the card).

Partial sets can be protected by Protection cards and destroyed by Hazard cards. The Appeal card allows you to take one card from another player, in return for the Appeal card, which can then be used again by its new owner. Some of the species are Rare Species. Completing these sets gains the player the appropriate counter.

To end the game you have to get a certain number of sets of species, with the rare ones counting for 2 or 3, depending on the value on the counter. Points are then totaled, with each species set being worth 50 points, with the appropriate multiplier (x2 or x3) for the Rare species, and cards in front of each player (but not yet in completed sets) being worth 10 points each.

The game consists of a large hat with spring platform, four plastic rabbits (three of which glow in the dark), a large silk Hocus Pocus handkerchief, a wand with four detachable tips and many rings that are the game's 'currency' which also glow in the dark and must be  worn on the fingers of players.

When a player has won enough rings during gameplay (they must be wearing 10 rings BEFORE their turn) they get the opportunity to insert the tip of the wand into the hat  release the spring, causing the rabbits to pop up in the air.  This may or may not occur, depending on whether the correct wand tip is chosen.

The first player to make the rabbits fly out of the hat is the winner.

Although this game can be played in the light (by pretending the black rabbit is 'invisible') it is much more atmospheric and exciting in the dark.

Gamers can take both games and compare just how much each side learned about amphibious operations in the three years that separated the two battles.

The game has an 11 by 17 map, 95 half-inch counters, 2 pages of charts and tables and 10 pages of rules. The game covers the Allied landings just after the Royal Navy went in and blew out of the water the German destroyer flotilla (that had just landed their troops).

The game uses a clever mechanic that ties in units' Fatigue Levels whenever they perform any sort of operation (move, attack, defend, retreat, you get the picture). The terrain and weather were so inhospitable that units can get worn down pretty quick, and players have to be thinking ahead to win the game.

Rules cover formation integrity, air support (mostly the Luftwaffe), limited intelligence, combined arms, even an armistice and/or internment of German units in Sweden. There is a lot packed into this little game, and we're very happy to be able to shoe-horn it in.

When a team lands on a space, the actor on that team (it changes every turn) must act out what's on the card in 30 seconds or less. The catch is, they *must* use sound - the rules include a provision where if the other team catches them not using sound, they lose credit for a right answer. Only sound effects - no speaking - are allowed however.

The board spaces are as follows: Action Reaction, which is a long form charade such as passing gas and blaming it on the dog. Famous Expressions is usually a cliche or popular phrase. People, Places  Things is self explanatory.

The fourth category is Hot Spot. Five items are on this card, and the team gets 60 seconds. If the actor can convey three out of the five, they get credit and continue to roll and move. Getting all five earns a Safe  Sound card. This can also be earned via its own space on the board. Safe  Sound allows an actor to pass a charade - but only once on a given turn, regardless of the amount of SS cards they have.

Some spaces are designated all play by an arrow. The finish space of the game is an All-Play Hot Spot. Whichever team gets the majority of the five items in 60 seconds gets credit - and if you're on the team on the final Hot Spot space, that means you're the winner.

The first player places one large object on Milton  their turn ends.  The next person to play places the relevant accessory object and then also another large object on Milton  their turn ends.  Play continues in this manner until Milton topples out of his hammock; the player who causes this event to occur is eliminated from the game.   All objects are removed from Milton, who is replaced in his hammock  play commences again until only one player, the winner, remains.

20911,Opiumkrieg 1839-42,2005,0,0,0,2,4,120,120,,Bluffing Transportation ,Trading,"From Spielbox . . .

In Opiumkrieg 1839-42 (The Opium War 1839-42), the goal is to be at the right place at the right time and then do the right thing. On the eve of the first Opium War, the players sail their junks through the China Sea and buy silk, spices, porcelain or tea from the various harbors. These wares are sold for a heavy profit in the canton where the English freighters are. But the freighters also bring a trading good with them, one out of India that is worth much gold in the harbors along the sea: Opium! The only catch  dealing in Opium is punishable by death. Each player can choose in this game: a long life, or get rich quick. After war breaks out, the needs of the dealers change on a daily basis, forcing flexibility: A harbor that might have been shut yesterday is now open again, where Opium trafficking might be punished heavily today, tomorrow the English might allow it again. The historic events of the time are also included and have an affect on the way the game goes. And yet, theres still enough variety in the game to make it play out differently each time and allow the players to influence the game in many ways!

On your turn, you either flip over a card from the draw pile, then buy, sell, or auction the card; or loot a card from a personal discard pile. The auction starts with you and goes once around but does not come back to you. If you win the auction, you pay the bank; if another player wins, they pay you and take the candle. In addition to candles, the deck includes unlit candles that you must pay off, but which can be used to pay off other unlit candles or loot candles. The deck also includes dancing candles that are wild, and can be used in place of any color.

In the basic game, the first player to collect all eight differently colored candles wins. In the advanced game, the player with the highest score at game's end wins. Candle Quest includes a junior  variant for ages five and six that removes auctions and discard pile purchases and changes unlit candles so that they can be used to steal a candle from another player.

Candle Quest is a re-theme of It's Alive! with a new publisher and artist; while It's Alive! was a re-theme of the original self-published 2005 version of Candle Quest which was called The Menorah Game.

While the theme features a Menorah related to the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, there is no religious content in the game.

Turncoats is a game of espionage where allegiances can shift at any time during conflict. Players must outsmart their opponent and manipulate the neutral force (which both players have control over) to win.

This fast-paced game combines strategy, luck and ingenuity to create a game that is fun and intriguing for people of all ages. The games concept is roughly based on the idea of a military conflict where two warring factions must manage the effect of a third force which can be influenced by either side. The French and Indian war is an example of a conflict similar to what players will encounter in Turncoats.

The board is made up of space-tiles each with a different geography laid out randomly, and each player has their own space fleet and starting technology.  A technology deck describes the various technological advances players can get.  Older races begin with more tech, younger races can acquire more.

The beginning of the game is primarily exploration and colonization using the star-fleet, dealing with random anomalies in space such as black holes, or space-pirates.  Once players make 1st contact, then military force and star fleets, and the political deck, come into play.

The winner is the player with the most colonies on the board when the last planet in the galaxy is colonized.  Planets are also drawn from a random deck, each with different difficulty ratings, mineral wealth and population maxima.

Splittin Infinitives is suitable for an afternoon's or evening's gaming.  The various decks give variety, and keep it light-hearted, while the base allows for strategic serious play.  The rules are simple enough to fit on one page, and it can be played right out of the box.

20928,Long Winding Road,1999,7.42857,7,1,1,1,2,2,,Racing Sports ,Dice Rolling,"Long Winding Road provides the chance to run a full season's Marathon Championship with the 141 men and 78 women each running 6 races during the year. You can choose from over 40 courses together with their Weather Modifiers. A Championship season of 12 races for men and 10 for women is suggested, so with each race taking about 2 1/2 hours playing time such a season would take around 60 hours to complete - well within the realms of possibility for many replay gamers if feedback from you is anything to go by.

The aim has been to try to recreate the way in which actual Marathon events develop, with small groups of runners breaking away off the front of the main pack, and others losing ground off the back.

We recommend 40 to 70 starters, although the system can cope with larger numbers if necessary, and we deal with the race in 1 kilometer stages, so it would not be sensible or enjoyable to require a dice roll for every competitor each kilometer. With a field of 70 that would entail around 3000 dice rolls!

So we only concern ourselves with identifying those runners within each Group (in game terms a Group consists of any number of runners from one upwards occupying a single 10-second space of our Endless Track) who need their Rating checked for that particular kilometer of the race to see whether they stay with their present Group, or make a forward or backward movement - that is gain or lose around 10 seconds on their Group over this kilometer.

National, European, Commonwealth, and Asian Championships can be run within the context of the main season's Championship, plus a Team Championship on a race-by-race or full season basis.

The Royal Musketeers are personal guards of King Louis XIII, defending the King against the dubious plots of Cardinal Richelieu. Athos, Porthos, Aramis, d'Artagnan, Rochefort, and MiLady DiWinter move around Paris, fighting duels and completing missions to earn the favor of the King and Cardinal. Both characters and players earn Favors throughout the game and bonus points are scored at the end when players reveal their true allegiances. The winner is the player who's earned the most Favor!

All For One is a pickup/deliver game for 3-5 players. Players are not tied to any specific character, rather each turn you choose which character to activate and then take actions with that character. Each player is secretly assigned one of the characters whose score will be added to their own at the end of the game. Your 'secret identity' helps drive decisions during the game, but in order to win you'll have to utilize all of the characters.

The board is an interconnected web of streets, some of which are patrolled by Cardinal's Guards. The guards serve to hinder the musketeers' progress. There are 6 named locations where the characters begin the game, and the other 18 locations are home to 1 plot token each. 2 of the tokens are horses, which can be ridden by the characters. The rest are used to complete missions.

The missions are printed on Mission Cards, which detail which character must complete the mission, which Plot Tokens are necessary to complete the mission, and the location at which the mission must be completed. Completing these missions involves collecting various Plot Tokens from around the board, and bringing them to specific places. Some missions involve getting 2 of the characters to a specific place at the same time, and some missions involve a duel between two characters.

Get either question right--it's not clear, from the rules, who gets to choose which question gets asked, the asker or the answerer--and you get the points listed on the card.  There is often no clear connection between the point value of the question and its difficulty.  The pictures, however, are very nice.

In an odd twist, if a card's question goes unanswered, the answer is then read aloud and the card set aside.  After all the rest of the cards have been dealt with, this pile of discards--whose answers, again, have been revealed--gets shuffled up and gone through again.

There is a range difficulty from lots of people know this to Wow!  I didn't know that.  More difficult questions have multiple choice answers and higher point (vote) value.  Using political reasoning and/or logic can yield a correct answer even when it is not initially known.
The board for POWERPLAY resembles a Senate chamber.  Players are Senators.  Each player/team gets a Committee Table.  The object of the game is to correctly answer questions in each category to gain Committee Seats as well as more votes than your opponents.  
Strategies that can be used include:

    answering multiple choice questions correctly before the answers are read gives the player double the votes for that question
    censuring an opponent sends them to the censure room where they cannot answer questions to gain Committee Seats or votes
    filibustering allows a player to remove votes from their opponents
    players can remove opponents from Committees on which they have already gained a seat
    players that have a Seat on every Committee have a choice: either allow their opponents to chose the category for the next question and automatically win with a correct answer or continue playing and maintaining control over which category questions will be answered.

We have found that the game works best with three or more players. Two player games tend to go on for a long time with much frustration.

The board is an 8x8 square grid, and the pieces are rectangles in two colors, seven for each player, each spanning two square spaces. Dominos in two colors on a standard Checker board work well. On a turn, a player pins one end of any of his/her pieces, then rotates it 90 clockwise. If, and only if, that would cause the rotating end of the piece to occupy a space that is either already filled, off the board or behind the pivot end of the piece, continue rotating the piece another 90 to 180. Likewise, continue rotating another 90 to 270 if the next target space is unavailable or illegal. If none of the three target spaces make a legal move, the player must select a different piece to move. The first to land one end of a piece on the opposite row wins.

She has just entered the children's room. Laura and her younger brother Tommy have been playing all day and their toys are scattered across the little room. They must tidy the room before they go to bed, but it is already beginning to get dark. Will the children be able to finish and be in bed before Laura's star is twinkling in the sky?

Laura's Star Game is about playing - hearing - feeling - reading!

The 12 Displays form the entire room of Laura's as a 62 picture. Each display has two empty slots for a couple of almost identical items like cars, airplanes, hand mirrors, flashlights, rubber ducks and slippers.

These items are placed inside a bag that has two separate pockets, and each pocket will contain one of each item plus either the dog or the bear. The 7 pieces of the Sun is assembled to form a clever timer: it has a central star-shaped part plus 5 pieces, each with 3 beams filling out the slots between the arms of the star. Finally is a cloud piece covering the sun when the game begins.

A player will stick a hand into each pocket of the bag, trying to identify two identical shapes without looking. This is much harder than it seems since the pieces have nicely rounded edges that makes them feel somewhat like each other, and even adults will find it difficult. It is however good training of the motor skills - especially for the wrong hand!

When the player is confident that two identical pieces have been found are the two pieces simultaneously retracted: If identical have the player succeed and the pieces are placed in the corresponding display and placed in front of the player.

Should the two pieces turn out not to be identical are they returned to the same pockets they were drawn from, and a piece of the Sun puzzle is removed. When only the central part of the sun remains will it be flipped over the next time a player fails, thus showing the star of the story. It's bedtime, the game is over and all the players lost because they didn't make the room tidy in time.

If the players manage to make the room in time, that is when the only tiles left in the bag are the dog and the bear, will the winner the player with most displays in front of her.

21058,Slim River,2005,0,0,0,2,2,30,30,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"On January 7, the British 12th Brigade, which had been hammered back for weeks, now faced a new bold foe: Japanese tanks (type 95 and 97) composed of two companies supported by the 42nd Regiment. With only a few antitank weapons, the British defenders were hard pressed when the Japanese bold use of armor in the jungles began at 0330. What followed was simply a mini-blitzkrieg as the Japanese tanks found numerous previously undiscovered roads through which to bypass British defenses. The British really did not know what hit them and by 0830, the Japanese had secured the Slim River bridge and the road to Singapore was open. In the game, chance cards create the uncertainty of battle from the sudden approach of Japanese aircraft, discovering a bypass road, stumbling onto a minefield, or the sudden activation of British units. Formation cards determine which formations activate and in which order, depending on the player that plays them. This will vary with every game turn. All this creates a totally unpredictable game.

The game comes with a 11x17 in. map, 280 counters, formation and chance cards, which are used to activate the counters on the map, a rulebook. The scale is 350 yards per hex, platoons, individual tanks\weapons, 30 min. turns for a total of 11 turns.

Once again, terror has come to New England, this time spreading to the small country town of Dunwich, just a few miles from Arkham. The area is filled with rolling hills, many of which are topped with mysterious stone circles or the ramshackle houses of the recluses who live outside of town. At night, the piping of the whippoorwills fills the air, while lightning bugs dance in the witch-haunted hallows. This is a place where dark pacts with unknown forces are made, and where city folk go to disappear without a trace. But however much the people of Dunwich may distrust outsiders, they desperately need your help against the Horror that has manifested on the Whateley farm...

Dunwich Horror adds 8 Investigators, 4 Ancient Ones, 15 Item cards, 25 Unique Item cards, 21 Spell cards, 11 Skill cards, 5 Ally cards, 4 Condition cards, 28 Monster tokens, 36 Mythos cards and 32 Gate cards to the base set.  It also adds new location cards, for a total of 14 cards at each location instead of 7.  Dunwich Horror also adds many new mechanics. Players can take a train to Dunwich (a new board that is placed on the end of the Arkham board), which adds 9 new locations and 2 new outer worlds to the game. Players reduced to 0 stamina or sanity have the option of drawing from the Injury or Madness deck, acquiring permanent handicaps, rather than losing half their items and clue tokens. Gates are no longer permanently sealed (a popular house rule in the base game). Condition cards provide benefits to all players may be activated. And, of course, the Dunwich Horror itself - not as strong as the Ancient Ones, yet far stronger than any other monster in the game.

This expansion also features revised rules and an FAQ that addresses many of the perceived faults of the base game. Replacement cards are provided for items and spells that are subject to errata.

21063,Calypso,2005,6.35,12,1,2,6,15,15,Children's,Animals Children's Game Deduction Memory ,MemoryPattern Recognition,"[Translated from French, so might not be completely accurate...]

Calypso is at the same time a game of memory and deduction. In the center of the table, 6 tiles show fish of different colors, with another colored fish on the reverse. There are 4 colors in total. When the die roll shows a blue fish, you must turn over a plate to reveal a blue fish. It is thus useful to remember the movements of the fish. But when your memory fails, your powers of deduction can take over.

Imagine that you must turn over a red fish and that the situation on the table is as follows:

Purple fish, Yellow fish, Yellow fish, Blue fish, Blue fish, Blue fish

You can deduce that a red fish is under purple fish. Indeed, the three blue fish are blue/red, blue/yellow and blue/purple. The two yellow fish are thus yellow/red and yellow/purple. The last fish is thus purple/red, the only missing combination.

This combination of reasoning and memory allows kids and adults to play each other. Whilst the adults can play the reasoning game, kids are generally much better at memory games!

21065,Azacru,2005,6.61111,18,2.1667,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Tile Placement,"Azacru has one objective: to have as many squares of your color on the board at the end of the game. There two very different dynamics at work in the game. Since you cannot land on a square of another player's color, part of the game focuses on blocking opposition pieces and avoiding being blocked. However the game features a connection change move which involves pre-planning so that you can move one of your pieces several squares across to another square already of your color. Potentially this could be right across the board, which is a 9 by 9 grid.

Each time a piece moves the square it lands on becomes its own color, and the number of colored squares it has in one of the nine 3x3 borderlands on the game board determines the power of movement the piece has.

If the connection change involves changing a square of opposition color then your piece leaves the game, but this can also be to your advantage since the game ends shortly after the first person playing is in a position where they cannot move any pieces. So players strive to get ahead on squares and then cause any early end to the game ... or wait so that they can make a dramatic connection change on the last turn that follows the first person being unable to move.

Azacru is one of the games featured in the Pacru Series 302 game box of 2005 (the games all use the same board, pieces/chevrons and markers). Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru  Azacru.

21066,Shacru,2004,6.31033,15,1.5714,2,4,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Tile Placement,"The object of Shacru is to acquire as many squares of your color on the board as possible before the game is over.  The board is a 9 by 9 grid divided into 9 borderlands of 3 by 3 squares (could now be mistaken for Sudoku!), and at the start of the game all of the squares are neutral (not colored).

With 2 players there are four pieces (aka chevrons) each, with 3 or 4 players three pieces each.

Each time you move a piece the square you move onto becomes your color.  You can move onto neutral squares, or squares of your own color, but not onto squares of a different color.  So the game focuses on blocking the pieces of other players, and avoiding your pieces becoming blocked.

Pieces move only forwards (forwards directly or forwards to left or right).  When a piece crosses a border the player can twist the piece 45 degrees to the left or right.

The game ends when no player can gain any more squares of their color (either because none of their pieces can move, or because they can only move around onto squares that are already their colour).

Shacru was first published as part of the Pacru 101 game, and again with the Pacru 302 game.  It can also be played with crayons and paper with the addition of some colored chevron/arrow shaped pieces to move around the paper.  Free software exists at http://www.pacru.com/shacru.html.

The game is suitable for anyone aged five years or over.

Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru  Azacru as opinions vary widely on the 3 games.

Any time you move a piece across the center line, it becomes your opponent's piece. You may only capture pieces belonging to your opponent, so pieces which get moved onto your side of the board can only be captured by your opponent. The game ends if one player runs out of pieces.

21075,RAEj,1986,5,1,0,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Dice ,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"From reading the rules:

A bizarre and unlikely combination of checkers, Chinese checkers, backgammon, and chess.

Note: production quality of this game is surprisingly high. The checkers feel to be made of high-quality material, and feel cool and smooth to the touch, reminiscent of 'Go' stones, but much larger (and flat). They have star outline, star-filled, and star-filled in a circle designed etched into them: 1 set blue etchings, 1 set red etchings. The board is standard hard cardboard. The board art is gray background with white lines, with blue and red stars, triangles, and square delineated colored zones.

From the rules:

Each player starts with 1 'pawn' (checker) and 1 King' (checker with a star in a circle design} on their designated opposed short-sides of the 9 x 10 square board. Two dice (each numbered only 1-3) are rolled to determine movement.

Pawns (checkers) move forward or sideways and can only jump other pawns.

Knights' (checkers with a star design) are created by jumping a pawn with its own King, They can jump pawns or knights, and may not be jumped by pawns. When a pawn is knighted, the checker is flipped over to it's star-design side.

Kings (checker with a star in a circle design) move forward, backward, or sideways. They can jump any piece, but must stay out of the opponent's holding zone (a 3 x 3 square area in the middle of the opponent's side).

A piece may enter the board on a player's holding zone when a 2 is rolled on a die, and is moved the number on the other die.

A piece may leave the board when it is in a destination square (located on the last rank of the opponents side of the board) on any roll.

Captures are only made by a King. When a king jumps an opposing piece, that piece is placed back in the opponent's 'holding zone' (effectively starting over it's journey).

There is a scoring system in place for end-of game (Pawns with 1, Knights 2, Kings 4), and the doubling-cube is used to issue challenges during play.

The rule-sheet has a small section on strategies, and Championship tournament guidelines. Very ambitious.

Teams alternate turns until someone guesses the password. Any player who guesses the password is awarded the card for scorekeeping purposes. The first team awarded six cards is the winner.

Hastily the frightened settlers flee oversees to one of the small islands. Then, the barbarian riders appear and spread over the land, destroying everything in their way. Cities, villages, and landscapes, nothing is safe.

Gamers have the choice of competing in a single race or the entire F1 championships playing on the different race tracks similar to the actual F1 Championship.

Each player (driver) has an identical deck of movement cards, which also represents their fuel, so if at any time during the game they run out of cards, they are out of the game!

Before the race, players are given 12 construction points to customize their cars according to how they think it will race best on the track selected (the basic game comes with 2 tracks - Malaysia  Japan). Players can choose from better:
- Acceleration (1 point).
- Braking (1 point).
- Cornering (2 points).
- Special features (3 points).

The race is over 3 laps, and players begin with 5 cards from their deck, and 3 Event cards (which introduce elements such as rain, safety car, etc).

Each round, players starting with the race leader:
1) Decide if he/she wishes to play an Event card. The effects take place immediately.
2) Must play 1 Movement card and MAY play 1 other card (Acceleration, Braking, Cornering or Special).
3) Players then move their cars according to the modified score of their cards.

As in real life, players have to really plan how to negotiate the corners, where penalty points in the form of tire wear is imposed if players pass the corners. Essentially, players who land on the corners receive no penalty.

Players also have to plan tactically when to make their pit stops, and whether they take a short one (just top up petrol), or a longer one (where they also change tires).

In the end, players who manage their resources well, take risks at the right time and plan their pit stops well will emerge the winner!

'About 10 years ago I wanted to design a game that suited my own needs. I played many wargames and although some were close to what my vision is of a perfect game there was always something to bother about.

'I played many many wargames, and many of them disappointing me. In my opinion a game should have a fine mix of these elements:

* fast pacing, simple and only relevant statics
    * depth, a good mix of planning, bluffing, fast thinking and random elements
    * flexible, can you implement scenarios, new elements, characters and objects?
    * rich, a fantasy world provides a rich world, there are almost no limits
    * epic, can you remember the games you played a year ago?
    * cheap, well you can actually download Warbands for free from this site. In return I ask you to enter the forums and join the discussions.

'These key-elements I kept in mind developing Warbands, I show no hesitation using elements from existing games to develop Warbands. Its really fun, fast-paced and has a lot of tactical depth.'

In the game Warbands you are represented by a hero-mage figure controlling a party of a few or maybe a dozen characters on a battlefield. This complete party is called a warband. Each character in the wardband has an unique name. With you controlling this warband you can play the provided scenarios or the ones you created yourself but the game is also designed to battle versus an enemy warband. In an arena or in the open, battle it out till the enemy character is destroyed.

It is not only a game, but it may constitute an help for the realization of theatrical or narrative structures.

The players take three cards each an try to form a particular configuration before the other players. When such a configuration is done, the player says TRIS and puts the cards in his score stack. Another hand is dealt and so on, until the cards are over.

The scoring differs in the three version of the game (Base, Medium and Difficult). In the base games it is simply the number of cards captured, while in the other versions also the numbers on the cards are taken into account.

21142,Careful,1967,6.325,16,1.25,2,0,25,25,,Action / Dexterity ,Modular Board,"Careful is a dexterity game similar to Villa Paletti and Jenga.  In the set-up, players build a bell tower five levels high using the plastic colored support posts and floors provided, as dictated by the color dots on the floor levels.  Supports are not placed on the top floor; a heavy plastic-enclosed bell structure is placed in the centre of this level, which sounds when the tower becomes unstable.  Then comes the deconstruction.

A turn consists of spinning the spinner and removing a pillar of the color spun from any floor of the tower. The floor levels have channels cut in them that makes the movement and removal of the support posts a challenge.  Players may manipulate the tower as necessary to remove the pillar, but all pillars removed on a turn that are not the spun color must be replaced before removing the objective support post.  Play continues until the tower falls; the player causing this to occur receives no points for the round whilst all other players receive points based on the color and number of supports taken on their turns.

Players play a number of rounds equal to the number of players playing.  The player who accumulates the most points is the winner.

21143,Das Rasante Kunstflugspiel,1983,0,0,0,1,4,15,15,,,Dice RollingRoll / Spin and Move,"Or: Hexagames - Sonderanfertigung fr die 1. Spielertage, Essen 1983 - Das Rasante Kunstflugspiel - Mit do-it-yourself Spielregeln (*) to give it it's full title.

This must be the most unremarkable game to have ever been presented on any of the Essen game fairs if it wasn't for a very small detail: it was the first promotional give-away game on the Essen fair ever. Maybe I'm selling it short. It was possibly also an entry in a whole new genre: make-it-up-yourself-gaming.

Jrgen Hagedorn from Hexagames was simply handing out  20x35cm sheet of paper, with a hand-drawn game board on it. Stuck to a corner was a small bag with 4 wooden cylinders and a dice. The drawing was very suggestive, but had no rules. Brilliant!

Whilst freebies continued to be used by various companies in an effort to get noticed, they often took the shape of fashionable and pointless pins that people could stick on their clothes, or, after a more inspired moment by Jumbo, were god's gift to gamers on Essen: jumbo-sized carrier bags - with appropriate logo off course.

For all the concentrated creative energy on show, it's amazing that it didn't seem to dawn on anyone what the potential of promo-games were when it came to getting people to your stand. It took until 1995 before the next noteworthy Essen promo-expansion appeared: Goldsieber's 13th constellation for Sternenhimmel (although this was not free). Kosmos followed in 1998 with a robber-gang-figure for Die Siedler von Catan, probably embarrassed by the success of the game and in a genuine effort to thank the fans. But it wasn't until Hans im Glck released a player's expansion for its El Grande that the promo floodgates truly opened. Hans im Glck is possibly still the worst offender with an endless flood of yearly Carcassonne add-ons. But where Hans led, many followed, and any visitor to the Essen Fair these days will find roaming bands of keen players trying to snaffle up all the special Essen promos on offer. It is rumored that not all of these end up on eBay. I won't join the debate weather this is racketeering or entrepreneurial. I do however applaud the recent initiatives from certain game companies to claw some of those eBay profits back, by no longer offering these promos for free, but asking a small donation for charity instead. Everyone a winner.

The game itself, off course, hardly got noticed and was easily forgotten. What do you expect from a sheet with a large plane and a game-of-goose type track of fluffy clouds that have different shapes but lack any explanation?

Nevertheless, now the Essen Freebie Game (Expansion) has became a bit of an institution, it might be time to pay tribute to the very first one: Hexagames, we salute you with a BGG entry for what must have been a great laugh.

The Species Conflict

The year is 2038.

Man has grasped deep into the ocean, the wild lands, and into the orbital space, colonizing and tearing resources for the peoples use in a darkening future.

The future at a glance seems hard, for the birth of Risen animal species to intelligence and form like the human kind. Species hatred flares as humans have employed these new lifeforms where humans deem fit. Life has been hard for the Hybrids and the Risen, often worked to their deaths in colonial construction.

As well, many humans are fearful that they may be placed the loser in species conflict. Older folk are afraid of the frog, rat, and feline folk that now live next door.

All the while the Corporate Lords take their due as new leaders of the 21st century.

Welcome to Pacifica, your role is as a thief and a soldier. Leaders of Buka Units such as yourself will do battle, live as a rogue, and all the while laugh at those who do not know honor and freedom. Southeast off the shore of Japan, is where you are needed as the the 1,000,000 souls of the Pacifica Ocean Settlements are at odds with seeming rebels. These insurgents may be backed by powerful forces, so beware.

Pacifica makes its pay from oil drilling, tourism, research programs, and especially, the Titan Naga Platform that taps and collects geothermal energy from the earths core.

Of course, the internet now exists as both the wire of mother earth, and as playground. Webcrawlers with HUD net access fly as Deva across the shadowy illusion that is the Cybernet. Pays to keep a few of those people around.

Some, like yourself, will make their pay by covert operations. Welcome Buka rogue,

Enjoy your stay.

The game is a build-it-yourself PDF download.  It includes a modular board, units (infantry, vehicles, and weapons) a rulebook, and 44 cards used to represent background cyber-combat, or the opponents' wrestling for control of the computer system of the building they are in.  Physical combat is decided by a more conventional roll-to-hit system.  Rules are included to simulate combat in flooded and fully submerged locations.

Most of the cards have either green circles that represent Mickey Mouse, red circles that represent Donald Duck, blue circles that represent Pluto, or yellow circles that represent Goofy.

The game can be played with two to four players.  The four-player game can be played with a set of two partners.  The game begins with each player being dealt 4 cards.  Three cards are placed face up in the middle of a table, although the 3-player game requires five cards to be placed face up in the middle of the table instead of three.

Players can claim cards in three ways.

1. By matching: A player can claim a card that matches on in his or her hand.
2. By combining: If there is a Mickey Mouse Lucky One on the table, a player can form a +1 addition equation to place this card on another card already on the table and pick it up with a next highest number card in the player's hand.
3. By building: A player can attempt to form an addition equation to pick up a set of cards.  For example: If there is a 3 on the table, a player can place a 4 on a 3 to build a 7.  If player can use a 7 card next round to pick up the 4 and 3.  However, this player could lose this 4 + 3 in two ways.  Another player could take this 4 + 3 before next turn by playing a 7, or another player could attempt to build a higher number equation by placing another card on the 4 + 3 stack.  However, a player cannot build unless he or she has a card to pick up the stack.

A player that cannot match, combine, or build must place one card on the table.  The player making the last play takes any cards left on the table.  A player gets 3 points for having the most cards, 2 points for a Lucky 2, 2 points for a Lucky 10, and 1 point for a Lucky 1.  The player or team that is the first to get 25 points wins the game.

21156,Forchess,1975,0,0,0,4,4,90,90,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"This game is similar but different from Fouray or 4 Player Chess.  The biggest difference might be that traditonal 4 Player Chess has 96 open spaces in the initial setup while Forchess only has 4 open spaces.

There are two version to this game.

1.  Standard Forchess has fixed alliances
2.  Cutthroat Forchess focuses on fluid alliances

In this game, four traditional chess sets are placed on the smaller and traditional 8 by 8 board with one pawn removed from each player's side, meaning that conflict occurs quickly due to a lack of available space.  In this version, the pawns move forward diagonally and capture forward vertically and forward horizontally, but they can never move more than one square at a time and thus there is no en passant capture technique in this game.  Castling does not exist in Forchess.  It is suggested that kings should be captured like other pieces, although opponents should still say check when putting a king in jeopardy.  Furthermore, a player cannot place a teammate in check.  If a player cannot move any of his pieces, he must remove one piece from the board per turn until he can move a piece.  If a player captures a king, he may then use all of the removed player's pieces!

21158,Snakes Alive!,1966,5.875,4,1,3,4,30,30,,Action / Dexterity Animals Humor ,Betting/WageringSet CollectionSimultaneous Action Selection,"This game is best played in a largish area with the competitors sitting in a circle on the floor.  A plastic basket containing a coiled 'snake' is placed in the center of the players.  The 'snake' consists of a large, material-covered spring with a plastic head on one end.  The basket has a number of holes, one of which will activate the latch on the basket and release the snake.

Players select a colored Swami  place it in position at the base of the basket closest to them.  During the game, players are not permitted to move their hands away from their Swami unless it is their turn or their name is called during play.

Players start the game with 5 snake tokens each.  A turn consists of paying a token into the 'snake pit', calling out an opponent's name and pressing a hole in the basket.

If nothing happens, the player can elect to continue their turn for as long as they want, rotating the basket, pressing successive holes  calling out an opponent's name each time, paying a snake token into the snake pit before each press.  Whenever a player manages to get rid of all their snake tokens, they take a ruby from the 'treasure trove' and a fresh set of 5 snake tokens from the snake pit.  A player may end their turn at any time without having released the snake.

If the snake is released, the relevant opponent must catch the snake or they are penalized - they must return one ruby to the treasure trove or take 5 snake tokens from the snake pit if they have no rubies.

If the snake is successfully caught, the caller must give the opponent one of their own rubies.  If no ruby is owned, the opponent gives the caller all the snake tokens they currently hold and - since they now have no more snake tokens - they take a ruby from the 'treasure trove' and a fresh set of 5 snake tokens from the snake pit.

Any player who erroneously attempts to catch the snake or otherwise removes their hands from their Swami at an unauthorized time during play is penalized.  They receive a snake token from each of their opponents.

The first player with 5 rubies is the winner.

Kaleidomaze is a simple to play board game in a new dimension, which offers you the most unique experience of zigzagging through a maze - AN EVER CHANGING MAZE!

The object is to score from your opponents by taking over their BASEs and trapping their SUBJECT tokens in the maze with your STRESSOR peg. It sounds easy! But remember that your opponents are also trying their best to do the same - taking over your base and trapping you in the maze. Under these competitive conditions, the players manipulate the existing maze into a dynamic ever changing maze, that is KALEIDOMAZE.

As in life, very often you than CHANCEs (cards) for better or worse; and occasionally save one or two CREDITs (cards) to be used under certain adverse situations. Sometimes you may encounter such a dilemma of being trapped by your competitors; but fortunately many times you are able to develop intricate strategies and tactical moves to revert the embarrassment. Very often, your goal appears so close and yet it suddenly becomes so far. Many times, it appears so unlikely and yet it suddenly becomes so easy. This is KALEIDOMAZE.

You need strategy, judgment and luck to win the game. The rules are simple, and the skillfully designed gameboard and playing pieces allow you a wide choice of moves. This puzzling maze, being manipulated by you and your opponents, many times is very rewarding, but can also become a frustrating and aggravating challenge.

Players answer questions picking from five predetermined answers and creating one of their own. Each of the predetermined answers garners a certain amount of spaces to be moved based on the answers popularity in a survey of Clarissa's friends. If any players match their made-up answers each player collects one of twelve keys in six colors from the center or another player. Moving takes place simultaneously with each player preforming the action on the space they land on.
Certain spaces lead to Crisis cards, which can be countered with collected Rescue cards. Others allow players to attempt to win a Driver's License by picking three numbers and attempting to roll one of them on a die. Still other spaces just allow you to hang out or go get a snack.
If a player makes it around the whole board with at least one key and a Driver's License they choose one of six Car Cards and try to match the color of one of their keys. First player to match a car and a key wins.

Ten activity games that can be played inside or outside the house.  Truly a party in a box.  Find the red triangle, then the blue party hat, then the square birthday cake.  The last one there will be too late.  This is your invitation to FUN, FUN, FUN.

The game pieces are incredibly durable and the pictures are cute! If you are familiar with the storybook character, Corduroy, than you know the cute bear sketch that I am referencing. In addition to the bears, there are party hats, cakes and presents. The floor tiles assist toward shape and color recognition. I enjoy observing which/how many children count the candles on the cake(s) (there are five). And because there is a connection, via the character, to books... it is my belief that this game inspires reading...this set is best suited, for day care, preschool or kindergarten aged children.  It would be great in the classroom; especially with the storybook, as a compliment.

Out of the 10 activity games 3 are non-competitive while the other 7 are competitive in which case the winner receives prize tokens.

21194,Looping,1991,3.4,5,1,2,6,45,45,,Aviation / Flight Card Game ,Tile Placement,"LOOPING is a simple card game with the theme of aerobatics.  Each card represents the side view of an aircraft completing a maneuver - climbing, diving, looping or some other similar action.

The start card shows an aircraft taking off and to this players add further cards in a sequence with the smoke trails on the cards indicating where two cards can be connected together.  The card also indicates the difficulty of the stunt - and the points gained if the maneuver is successfully completed.

Then idea of the game is to attempt to add cards allowing the aircraft to gain and lose altitude undertaking a variety of tricks on the way.  Whether the trick is achieved or not is determined by a die roll (throwing higher than a given number shown on some of the cards). Points are earned for a successfully completed maneuver. If you fail any part of the sequence then you score nothing.

The game ends when the aircraft is brought in to land, through the laying of the appropriate card, at a level at the same altitude from which it took off.  The winner is the player who scored the most points during the flight.

The game has three variants OVER THE CLOUDS (3-5 players)  DARE-DEVILS (2-4 players) and SKY-RIDER (3-6 players)which, though broadly similar, do make the game suitable for differing numbers of players.

Warfare is the way of deception. Therefore, if able, appear unable; if active, appear not active; if near, appear far; if far, appear near. If they have advantage, entice them; if they are confused, take them; if they are substantial, prepare for them; if they are strong, avoid them; if they are angry, disturb them, if they are humble, make them haughty; if they are relaxed, toil them; if they are united, separate them. Attack where they are not prepared, go out to where they do not expect.

To win a game, one must either capture the Flag piece or defeat all the movable pieces of the opponent player. When two opposing game pieces are engaged in a battle, the identities of the two pieces are only revealed to the electronic referee system (not to the players) which determines the winning piece and the defeated piece. The battlefield consists of railway tracks along which the pieces can move continuously, country-road routes along which the pieces cannot move continuously, and bases which provide shelters to any pieces occupying them. On each side, the Flag piece is to be secretly placed in one of the two castle-shaped headquarters and guarded by movable troop pieces and unmovable Mines. Lively military figures, numeric numbers, and words in both English and Chinese are shown on the game pieces.

21220,Powerball,2000,6,1,0,2,6,10,10,,Action / Dexterity Sports ,Roll / Spin and MoveSimultaneous Action Selection,"Powerball Das Spiel is played within a wooden frame that is assembled in two halves.  The playing surface or pitch slopes down from the middle to the two ends where the players stand.  In the center of the pitch is a small indentation.  A ping-pong (table tennis) type ball is placed in the indentation.  The players each have one or more wooden shoots under their control, which they use to launch ball bearings at the ping-pong ball.  In front of the shoots at each end is a bar or barrier.  This is suspended just above the playing surface so that there is sufficient room for the ball bearings to run underneath, but not the ping-pong ball.  In the center of the bar the gap is higher.  This is the goal area where the ping-pong ball can also run underneath.  The idea of the game is to launch the ball bearings at the ping-pong ball and direct the ping-pong ball into the opponent's goal.  Play can be to a specific number of  goals or for a particular time period, with one to three players on each team.

21221,Don't Dump The Daisy,1970,6.86667,3,1,2,4,10,10,,Action / Dexterity Children's Game Party Game ,,"This game is another in a line of square-box molded-plastic board releases favored by Ideal Toy Corp. during this period.  It incorporates several elements seen either alone or in combination in other action/dexterity games produced around this time - marbles, gravity, a spring.

Players start the game with ten marbles.  Marbles must be placed on a large, plastic centrally-located daisy, which has vague depressions on each 'petal' for the marbles to rest in.  The stem of the daisy is a strong spring.

There are 16 cards, all of which direct the holder to either 'put' or 'take' a given number of marbles from the daisy each turn.  Four are dealt to each player; a turn consists of playing a card  following the directions.  If either the placing or removal of marbles causes the daisy to tip over, the player causing the incident must take all the marbles that fall from the daisy.

When all four cards are used (i.e. when each player has had four turns) the pack is reshuffled and a fresh set of four cards is dealt to each player.  Play continues in this manner until a player is able to place their final marble on one of the daisy's petals without causing any to fall.

The player who achieves this is the winner of the game.

The Team Cards have 2 functions only one of which can be used when it is played. The first function called the Territory Part uses a move value attached to Kicking, Passing and Running etc. which are implemented when the player has been allowed to on the FAC. The second function is the Action part which can be used to counter play determined by FAC's or indeed by the placing of other Team Cards.

Tries are awarded when the counter lands on the Tryline by means of Running, Passing and Tap Penalties. If Kicks, Mauls and Scrums move the counter onto the Tryline then players turn a FAC to see what the outcome is on the Grounded Ball section.

At an advanced level, once players become used to the basic game, Tryline offers you the opportunity to introduce Substitution Cards and a Yellow Card system.

Relive how kings managed to secure their power and gain the respect of their tribes. The construction of temples and canals, agricultural development and military victories can all spread your fame and secure your rule. Make constant decisions on how best to govern your land: rely on the rule of law and the gentle persuading powers of the Ishtar priestesses and strife for a blossoming agricultural system, or turn to the fanaticism of the Marduk priests and the battle strength of their troops. However you choose to exert your rule - you can only win the game if your rule is so successful that your fame, in the eyes of your subjects, has acquired a god-like status, making you the undisputed ruler of Mesopotamia.

This is the first game from Hilmar Mhlmann and has undergone several years of development. Its final version was made available to the gaming community through his website and ebay. Having acquired a copy it is obvious that this is a labor of love. The design of board and cards is beautiful - the rules are well tested, clearly presented and relatively short for such a ambitious game. Ongoing support for players is in place through website updates and direct communication. And having just acquired my copy, I wonder if the price asked actually covers the materials provided. An impressive entry for this budding designer and a one to seek out for players who enjoy games like Settlers of Catan but yearn for something a bit meatier and with a stronger theme. With an Arthurian themed game in the pipeline, this one-man act might be an interesting one to follow.

The aim of the game is to have the most military units and construction works of your color on the board. This can be done over 2 to 5 rounds. Resources can be acquired through natural growth, trade and military conquests. Trade takes place along caravan routes. Players can trade freely with their trading partner, pay toll to players whose territory is crossed en-route, or exchange resources against a set course with the bank. These resources can then be used to generate new buildings or units. Each turn a player can use an influence card, adding flavor and variety without unbalancing strategic play. A nice twist is that players who allow toll-free trading between other players if the caravan route passes their territory see a generous windfall from the opening of this trade route in the next round, when some resources are added to the storage in that province. Each year round ends with construction and military campaigns. Conflicts are settled by dice rolls which are modified by markers on the board.

This game appeared in 2 versions:

The self-published 2D version (quality is at the very high end of desktop publishing).
Some assembly is required, mainly joining the 8 pages that from the superbly produced full colour game board. In total you get 39 multicolour A4 sheets, including several photo-quality prints, six pages of clear and well presented rules, and lots of event cards, markers and game aids.

The wooden case with the handmade 3D version of the game board is fit for a king, and for those with a rather large game budget.

Many team cards are available, where real teams are rated for Attack and Defence plus their ability in set scrums, rucks, loose mauls and line outs, as well as individually rated players for each team - to produce statistically accurate results and scorers.

Players roll dice and refer to various charts depending on the action, field position, and team ratings, to determine the outcome of events.  Players have opportunities to dictate teams tactics or actions during the match, and the result is the full end-to-end flow of a match, the grim battle between the opposing packs, tactical defensive play, the power of the loose maul, the rucks and scrums driving forward, and the sweeping open play as the backs come into the game.

21298,Line Out,1988,5.75,4,0,1,2,30,30,,Sports ,Dice RollingSimulation,"Line Out is a replay simulation of Rugby Union.

Teams are rated for Attack and Defence plus their ability in set scrums, rucks, loose mauls and line outs.

The game recreates the 'highlights' [potentially dangerous attacks] of a match based on the attach / defence ratings of the teams.

When either team's Attack number is rolled a simple procedure establishes how the attack started, which player has possession and where exactly on the field of play the attack is centered as you join the action. From then on dice rolls on one or other of the various Charts plot the outcome of the attack until it either breaks down or points are scored. Most of the actions are taken from the Action Chart which is  common to both teams, but approximately one in six are taken from the Team's own Team Card, helping recreate that team's particular style of play, strengths and weaknesses. Other 'actions' are  dependent on individual Player Ratings.

A marker is moved on the Field of Play to chart the  development of the attack, another marker on the Team Card shows who has possession, and a third is used on the Time Clock to keep track of time.

Team Cards use named players and substitutes, with individual Player Ratings to produce accurate results and scorers.  Teams from many seasons and competitions available, allowing for some great what if matchups, as well as full season replays.

Unbeknownst to them, the reinforced 95th Guards Rifle Division was moving into positions overlooking the village of Krasny Oktabyr. As the Germans moved up from the rivers edge, the two forces collided under a summer squall, mutual surprise giving way to ferocious fighting. The Russians charged through the rain into the midst of the German force. Fighting was at point blank range; tanks often shot each other at less than one hundred meters. Both sides lost several vehicles before they each fell back. The Germans aimed themselves at Hill 226.6, which clearly dominated the local landscape. This fight was only the first of several fought this day as the Russians struggled to hold them back...

It can easily be learned and played in a few short minutes, but mastery of the game will take much longer. Each and every move can have huge ramifications, and players will find it extremely difficult to plan more than a couple of rounds in advance.

I stumbled upon this game while skimming through some old journals I found in my grandfather#65533;s attic. The rules were gleaned from Kardon's writings on the Muighar tribes, and I've tried my best to keep them authentic. However, as Kardon's description of the rules are not very clear, this version may vary slightly from that of antiquity.

As most of you probably don't have access to authentic Muighar Slings and Stones pieces or boards, I've taken the liberty of finding some substitutions. This game can played using a chess board, with 4 pawns and 12 checkers. Pawns represent the slings, and checkers represent the stones.

21336,March on India 1944,1975,6.19,5,0,1,2,360,360,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"This is a wargame on the battles of Imphal and Kohima 1944.

This review first appeared in IPW, the newsletter for all discount games club members. Contact colin@allusedgames.demon.co.uk for details.


On the 6th March, 1944, the last great ground campaign of the Pacific theater began. The Japanese launched a two pronged thrust against the allied held towns of Kohima and Imphal. Both towns were allied forward supply dumps and the Japanese were intent upon capturing their contents.
The offensive came as a great surprise, as allied Intelligence had suggested an attack on this scale was beyond Japanese capabilities.

Historically, both locations were surrounded, but Imphal was reinforced and supplied by air. Neither town fell and they were both relieved by allied troops advancing from the railhead at Dimapur, further South West. At the time of writing, this is the only simulation I know of that covers the entire campaign at an operational scale.

A game turn commences with the British and Japanese players checking supply. The British player has Supply Dumps, each with its own number of supply points recorded on a track on the map. Units trace supply to these dumps and the points thereby consumed are subtracted from the track record. The Japanese are automatically in supply for the first two game turns. From turns three to eight, however, they must trace supply in a similar manner to the British, except that supply points are held by their HQ units rather than in supply dumps. These, being mobile, are more flexible.

The Japanese continue to trace supply after turn eight in the same manner, but supply points become rather scarce. Units without supply have both movement and combat factors halved and cannot attack. The exceptions are the three Japanese allied units of the Indian National Army, who are eliminated after two turns without supply. The supply rules for this game are its most complex procedure, but are easily manageable for an experienced player. Japanese movement and combat follow. Movement uses standard wargame practice, though a lot of the terrain on the map is tough going.

Combat also holds no real surprises, being based on odds adjusted by terrain. Combat results are exchanges, retreats and eliminations. On the first turn, the Japanese get a second movement phase after combat, simulating the initial advantage of surprise.

British movement and combat follow, after which any British reinforcements are added to the pool of such units held off map. The British player then gets to transfer supply points between dumps or transport points from an inexhaustible supply dump off map to those on.
The catch is that these same rail and air resources are also required to transport reinforcements on to the map. These, of course, are no good without supply, and vice versa.

Finally, Japanese reinforcements are added to the map and the game turn is over.

Little exists in the manner of Special rules. Engineers assist units in assaults across rivers, but not, strangely, against fortified lines. Artillery have a two hex range and British armored cavalry can retreat before combat in certain circumstances. Victory is determined by the number of towns and cities held by the Japanese player at games end and each players unit losses.

Despite being published back in 1975, March on India 1944 remains a good game whose rules are remarkably playable. Not suitable for beginners, but eminently playable solo, its subject has been sadly overlooked by game designers ever since. In my opinion, on the strength of this previous worthy offering, the subject deserves a more up to date treatment to test the mettle of the current crop of designers. Until then, seek out a copy of this one. You won't be disappointed.

Goal of the Game: The player wins who first connects his opposing sides of the board.

Each player 'owns' two opposing sides of the board. It is advised to mark the sides of each player (at least by placing all the pieces of the players on his sides only). The players may decide whether they want to place the board between them with the corners facing to them or whether they want to sit at an right angle with the sides toward them.

At the start of play the board is empty. One player starts the game. The play then alternates.

At each move the player whose turn it is has three options of play:


     He can enter one of his pieces onto the board;
     Move on of his pieces on the board; or
     Capture an opposing piece with one of his own pieces on the board. 


The player wins the game who is the first to get an uninterrupted line from one of his own sides of the board to his other (opposing) side.

For instance:

Rather than having stacks of men on each position, Nannon allows only one man per spot.
Since you can't stack men, contiguous groups of 2 or all 3 men of the same team can't be hit.
Each player has only three men, as opposed to the 15 of Backgammon.
Each player gets one die, rather than getting to use two. (Nannon makes use of the fact that each player has her own die.)
The board only has six positions, instead of 24.

Nannon does, however, still provide a doubling cube, which is rather relevant since the individual games of Nannon are so much shorter than those of Backgammon.

Dominox is played on a standard Chess/Checkers board using a standard set of Domino tiles. Only tiles with 0 to 6 dots are used. One player is designated 'white' while the other is 'black.' The players take turn placing tiles on the board, starting with the player who is dealt the lowest numbered double-tile, who must place this a his first move.

Tiles are placed according to the following restrictions:

* A tile must be placed such that it spans two squares (i.e., one half of the tile is on a black square and the other half is on a white).
    * No two tiles can share a square.
    * If a tile is placed next to another tile, the number of dots on the touching tile-end(s) must match that of its (their) neighbour. If a tile-end is next to several other tile-ends, only one of these need to match.

When there are no un-drawn tiles left and two passes in a row occur (i.e., both players pass), the game ends. At this point, the unfilled areas on the board are scored: Each connected unfilled area on the board counts to the color that is in majority in that area. If there is the same number of black and white squares, no player gets points for the area.

The player with the most points wins.

Pieces are moved in the fashion of the robots in Ricochet Robots. A piece travels in a straight line until it hits a wall or another piece, at which time it can turn left, right, or stop. A piece may make any number of turns and travel any distance in a turn, but once it stops, play proceeds to the next player.

Player 1 owns the black checkers, while player 2 owns the red checkers. Opponents alternate turns, as in most games. A 'king' is defined as in the game of Checkers: it is a stack of two checkers, of the same color. Kings cannot move but can be captured.

On his turn, a player chooses one of his own checkers to move. Moves are made vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. A single move consists of picking up the chosen checker, jumping it over an opponent's checker or king (the jumped checker or king must be directly above, below, left, or right of the moving checker), and landing on an unoccupied square on the other side of the jumped checker. The jumped checker or king is then captured (removed from the board). On the same turn, a player may (but is not required to) continue moving this chosen checker in this way, until that checker cannot capture any more. A checker can only move if in so doing it captures an opponent's checker or king.

On his turn, after he has finished capturing, a player may use the checkers which he has just captured to transform some of his opponent's checkers into kings, by placing a single captured checker on top of a checker of the same color which is still on the board. The two checkers from a captured king can be used to make two new kings. A player can make as many kings on his turn as he has captured checkers.

The loser is the first player not able to move on his turn.

The Simpsons: Homer's Trivia Game

Hello, I'm Homer J. Simpson! Everybody knows that I have only two hairs on the top of my head (d'oh!) But do you know why I lost most of my hair? Or why my frumpy, old maid of a sister-in-law Selma has no sense of smell or taste? No? Well, don't fret like that pansy Flanders! (The answers are below!) Inside this box are lots more questions about Springfield's number one father, me.

You can compete with your friends, or other Simpson trivia-geeks (you know the type I'm talking about!) See who knows more about me (and what's more important than that?). It's more more fun than Deviled-egg Nite at Moe's Tavern!

And guess what? The game comes with a Simpsons cast poster. Whoo-hoo!

Answers:
Homer lost more and more hair each time one of his children were born
Selma lost her sense of taste and smell when a bottle rocket shot up her nose

21369,The Two Ocean War,1982,7.5,4,0,2,2,240,240,Wargames,Nautical Wargame World War II ,Area Movement,"Rare add-on for Avalon Hill's 'War at Sea (second edition)' and 'Victory in the Pacific' series but also a standalone game.

Includes (688) 1 square styrene counters that can be used with the original games or with the included (4) maps and a (48) page rulebook for combined global game. The maps are 21 x 27 and there are two Pacific and two Atlantic maps with a total of 39 areas.

As a standalone game, The Two Ocean War allows double-blind player movement via two copies of the Atlantic and Pacific theater maps. During the movement phase, players place their fleets on their own game boards, unaware of the other player's moves. Once moves are completed, both players go area by area on both maps, resolving battles between fleets placed in the same areas on the two different maps and to resolve combat and determine victory points awarded for each sea zone. Combat is similar to the Avalon Hill sea games, using six-sided dice. Rolls of 1-4 are no effect, 5 is a disable (ship returns to port), 6 is a hit causing a subsequent die roll for amount of damage.

The game is superior to the Avalon Hill sea games in some regards. Highlights include larger fleets (CL-class ships for all nations are represented in addition to the other ship classes in the AH games), more sea zones, and the blind movement resulting in often surprising battle lineups in particular sea zones. Additional rules let small ships torpedo big ones under certain conditions, and since the game represents fleets worldwide, there are opportunities for some Axis ships to change theaters just as the Allied ships can.

There is no real limit, but the available place on most tables and the handling of some game mechanics usually do limit the player number to 6. Official multi-player rules dont clarify that.

21381,Sizzletoad!,2005,5.64286,7,1,2,4,20,20,,Animals Bluffing Card Game Children's Game ,Pattern BuildingRock-Paper-Scissors,"You've just stumbled onto a small secret pond, hidden right in your own neighborhood. Three odd little creatures and their frog-friends are playing, and whatever their game is it's good! There's a duck made of paper, a bug trapped in a rock, and a toad spitting sparks from its tongue.

They're all squealing and jumping, leap-frogging and bumping, and racing the pond; oh what fun! Such tumbling and flapping and sparking and quacking; how you'd love to join the confusion. Then they all see you watching and ask you to play, and assure you it's not an intrusion.

Sizzletoad! is the game for two to four players (ages 5 and up) that combines rock-paper-scissors and tic-tac-toe with an exciting leap-frog race around the pond! There's a nice bluffing element as well (especially in the 2-player version).

Players duel with each other in rock-paper-scissors style using their 12-card hands of Fossilticks, Paperducks, and Sizzletoads to decide which player will be able to put cards on the lily pad pond, make a tic-tac-toe, and score the most victory points.

During the race around the pond the excitement builds as the players speed closer and closer to the flower at the finish-line! Care for a game of Sizzletoad! anyone?

This is a great game for parents to play with their kids when they're looking for a bit more variation and strategy than say, Candy Land or the like.

Here's a quick How to Play summary for the two-player game:

In a two player game, of Sizzletoad! the players shuffle and split the deck (which is filled with an equal number of Sizzletoads, Fossilticks, and Paperducks.)

Each round a single card is compared between the players and the winner of the duel puts either of those two cards onto the lily-pad tic-tac-toe grid of the board.  The other card goes into that player's discard pile.

When one of the players places a matching 3-in-a-row card on the tic-tac-toe grid, the other player counts the cards in his/her own discard pile, scores one point for each card and moves his/her game piece around the board by that many pips, then hands his/her cards over to the maker of the tic-tac-toe.

The maker of the tic-tac-toe then puts those cards into his/her own discard pile and adds them all up, scoring one point for each card and also moving his/her game piece around the board by that many pips.

All of the cards are then shuffled, re-dealt, and the players have another duel. The players continue dueling and adding cards to the board and their own discard piles and moving their game pieces around the numbered pips on the board.

The winner is the player who makes it all the way around the board onto or past the flowered lily-pad before the other player.

With easy game play, this solid game is a fine addition to any children's' game library.

Remember:  Sizzletoad-beats-Paperduck-which-beats-Fossiltick-which-beats-Sizzletoad!

Sizzletoad! by Mindspan Labs (previously WizerGames) is Made in the USA

Mindspan Labs Digital has released a 1 and 2 player app version of Sizzletoad! that is now available in the Apple app store.

Placing a tower segment allows you to capture other players' Meeples, so long as they are in view of the tower in an orthogonal direction.  If the tower is 1 piece high, they can capture Meeples that are within 1 tile of the tower; if the tower is 2 pieces high, they can capture Meeples within 2 tiles of the tower; etc.  Not only do players lose whatever they may have scored with that Meeple, but they also have to pay 3 victory points if they want to free their Meeple.

There are two editions to this game. One is a standard long-box game with a traditional foldout game board, featuring flat plastic reindeer on wooden stands. The other edition features a 3-D rooftop game board that sits atop the game box, with holes in the roof to insert the plastic reindeer for movement. Both editions include a wooden nose for Rudolph to help a player in moving through the cloud spaces.

The 3-D version also came with a Santa Claus sack of five jingle bells so that players could mark how many times they had won. I do not recall if the standard edition came with this sack.

Shoestring Racer is a game about racing at the bottom end of the financial spectrum, where getting a bike built at all is a triumph of determination over lack of cash.  The first part of the game represents the panic-stricken rushing around to get the racing goodies in the last fortnight before the racing season starts and the second part is the actual race, in which you discover whether your hastily assembled pile of bits is a potential winner.

Carthage now has their own customized deck of 38 strategy cards plus there are 8 new events that replace cards in the Etruscan, Roman, and Greek decks. Additionally, Carthage has special powers that emphasize its historic strengths.


     Carthage can hire mercenaries allowing lesser peoples to do the dirty job of fighting for them.



     Carthage is the pre-eminent naval power of the era and has the ability to interdict any naval movement, blockade enemy cities, and provide supplies to allied cities under siege.



     Carthage can also provide the use of its ships to allies, allowing them to move great distances to launch unexpected attacks.


Perhaps Carthage will ally with the Greeks and sweep north using their combined navies to turn the tide, but what of Sicily? It now provides reinforcements and VPs for conquering it for both the Greeks and Carthage, but at a severe cost to the side that is denied the island. Perhaps the Greek player has allied with you just to encourage you to sail to Rome so he can launch a Sicilian campaign. And what of failure? The Carthaginian general who has the audacity to lose a battle may be crucified for his incompetence. The generals who survive always keep in mind that their mercenaries' loyalty lie not with Carthage, but with silver and gold.

The object of the game is to be the first player to move all four of his marbles around the board and into the center home area. The twist is that the board see-saws up and down depending on the position of the marbles. At the start, the board is perfectly balanced, but as the players move the marbles, the board tilts back and forth depending on the weight distribution of the marbles.

There are 18 slide areas around the board, and should your marble end up in one of these slides, a tilt of the board may send your marble forward or backward, or possibly right into the home area. (Think Chutes and Ladders with actual chutes.)

Though essentially a children's roll-and-move game, young players will quickly learn how to make the laws of gravity work for them. There is also some low-level strategy as players may choose to move their marbles backward if it would allow them to enter a slide.

21428,Royal Carpet,2001,4.5,1,2,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Point to Point Movement,"An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.

Object: Be the first player to get two Kings off the far edge of the board. This is done by laying down a carpet of friendly Checkers for the Kings to jump.

Only one piece may be moved or introduced per turn. Checkers may be introduced onto any empty square. Alternatively, Checkers may move to any adjacent, empty square. A King may only move by jumping (in any direction) over friendly Checkers or Kings, capturing as he goes. Captured Checkers may be reintroduced later, but Kings that are captured do not return to the game.

The mechanics of jumping are the same as in the game Checkers, except that Kings may jump off the far edge of the board, into the 'end zone.' This King is removed from play. If a King has an opportunity to jump, he must jump, continuing until no more jumps are possible. So beware!

Winning: Victory is achieved when a player has jumped two Kings into the end zone.

Royal Carpet is an attempt to create a game of tempo in which friendly pieces have both positive and negative synergies. Crafty players will block jumps and then unblock them later, forcing an enemy King to jump his royal brethren. For those so inclined, this game is fun to play with a backgammon doubling cube, held initially by the Red player.

21430,Sibling Rivalry,2001,4.5,1,2,2,2,45,45,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.

The sibling rivalry between you and your brother is legendary. Some ascribe the antagonism to the circumstances of your birth: When the Queen bore identical twins sons many years ago, a careless midwife placed both infants in the same bassinet without identifying the elder, and the rightful heir to the throne has been in doubt ever since. Others believe that your fierce competitiveness is simply a distillation of the belligerence that runs throughout your bloodline. For whatever reason, you have spent your entire life trying to prove your superiority to your brother.

Unfortunately, that life is about to end.

Four days ago Barbarians attacked from the west. Both you and your brother marshaled your individual forces and followed your father to meet the enemy. At first it seemed the battle would be easily won: for each of your soldiers who fell in battle a score of Marauders were dispatched. But by the third day it became apparent that, while your own forces rapidly dwindled, there would be no end to the Barbarian horde. And this morning your losing battle quickly became a rout: The King was slain, you found yourself surrounded, and the forces controlled by you and your brother were reduced to a mere handful a piece.

Now, as the Marauders press in, you know that you will soon be sent to your reward. But you don't fear death. In fact, only one thing weighs on your mind: this is your absolute last chance to outdo your brother. And you are certain he is thinking the same thing.

Object: Each player will attempt to amass more Kills than his opponent before both Princes die in battle.

Reference cards are also provided but not required.

The object of the game is to achieve the highest total score including bonuses.  This is accomplished by rolling dice combinations which match the categories on the score sheet and by the skillful choice of scoring options.

Imagine playing Yahtzee with poker dice, and you've got the basic premise of Royal Kismet.  There are three suits available - red, black, and green - with values from 6 to Ace in each suit.  Players attempt to create a poker hand (or other scoring set) after rolling the dice three times.

What makes Royal Kismet truly unique are the dice included.  Each die has a unique distribution of numbers and suits - making it much tougher to calculate the odds of rolling that last Ace you need.  (Blank sides and a Joker can also affect the roll.)

After moving, a player must find/identify all the fish in the middle of the board with the pattern corresponding to the space on the track they have landed on. The players then collect a number of small wooden fish equal to the number of fish they have found. When all the wooden fish are collected the game ends and the player with the most fish wins.

The game also includes rules and extra equipment for a slightly more involved game (requiring just a touch more counting skills).

The gameboard has a series of turntables on it, which can be rotated so as to alter the paths in front of the players: the skillful manipulation of the turntables lies at the heart of the game. Each turn the player's piece (a small racing car) moves 1,2,3, or 4 squares forwards, at the player's discretion. If he lands on a space with black dots, he can rotate a turntable anywhere on the board, either to clear his path to the finish line or to hinder someone else. The Finish squares when reached give you points, and then you return to the start, only winning when you have 100 pts. It is possible to become completely trapped in an area with no black dots, and this carries a penalty of 20 pts and return to start.

Overview:
The Mayan calendar is one of the oldest and most accurate calendar systems in human history. Using no more than their knowledge of the Earth, Sun, and stars, the Mayans were able to tabulate days, weeks, months, and years from 3113 BC until December 21, 2012 AD. No one knew why the Mayan calendar ended on that date..

On December 22, 2012, a small asteroid swung in from the outer solar system and clipped the moon.

For over a year astronomers had been tracking the asteroid, but due to its small size had not thought it a serious threat. It proved, however, to have a much higher density than expected. Its impact with the moon imparted a distinct 'wobble' to the lunar orbit and ejected megatons of lunar material into Earth orbit.

Scientists estimate the moon's orbit will return to normal in a few years. But, its erratic orbit will have catastrophic effects on Earth's biosphere during the first year. By the end of 2013, all life on the six northern continents will be extinct.

Welcome to mankind's last year

Two versions of this game are available:  A PDF (Print and Play) version and a Vassal version.

Then they sow them along a diagonal line of empty spaces on an 8x8 board, each picking up where the other player left off. When either player reaches the edge of the board, he chooses any empty diagonal line of spaces to continue sowing his stones.

After the board has been filled, the players count the number and size of the strings of stones they have created along an orthogonal axis of the board. Players earn points for sets of strings that contain one of each of the four allowable sizes of strings and lose points for strings that can't fit in a sequence.

21505,Lawsuit!,2005,1,2,0,2,6,0,0,,Economic Educational ,Roll / Spin and Move,"From the publisher's website:
Lawsuit! is an educational game for adults and children ages 6 and up. Players experience and learn about the law as they make their way through law school, past the bar exam and into their own law practice and the courtroom.
    
The board is divided into 62 spaces. Players proceed through law school; the nitty gritty of running a law practice (hiring a secretary, paying office rent); and the ups and downs of bringing a case (preparing papers for court, going to trial). Players also land on spaces, where they are directed to pick cards describing all sorts of interesting and amusing (and family-friendly) case scenarios.

When a card is chosen, a player must decide whether to accept the result or appeal it. On an appeal, a player may double or even triple his award -- or lose some or even all of it.

Instead of advancing when it's their turn, players may also choose to settle a case by drawing a Settlement card. Like appealing, settling a case can result in gaining -- or losing -- part or all of one's winnings.

Players may also double the stakes by buying into a partnership. All awards and costs are doubled for partners. Whether or not to become a partner is therefore a key strategic decision, and adds to the suspense and intrigue, as everyone wonders whether it will pay to have become one.

On your turn you play resources, which come in red (direct damage), green (combat) and blue (manipulation).  You use those resources to summon creatures or cast spells always with the goal of running your opponent out of cards.

On your turn you can do the following in order:
Untap your creatures/heroes/resources.
Draw a card
Play a resource
Use resources in play by turning them sideways (tapping) to pay for the cost of a card in your hand to put in play 
Attack with any heroes you have in play

Play then passes to the other player and continues until the winner empties his opponents draw deck.

Although compatible with C-23 and Xena, all three sets have different backs which makes mixing less useful than you might hope.

21524,Teleporters,2005,0,0,0,1,2,45,45,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Point to Point Movement,"From GAMES Magazine review:

On your turn, move two poles and two ports. Poles can move one or two spaces orthogonally, or they can teleport. A port has two ways of moving: It can either reorient (that is, spin so that its right angle is flush with any corner of the space it occupies), or it can glide across the board like a chess rook. A port forms a teleport by landing on a square with another of its color, with each right angle in opposite corners of the square. A teleport enclosing an enemy pole sends the pole back to one of its home spaces.

A pole teleports between any two of the following:  friendly teleports, home spaces, and goal spaces (except that a pole can only teleport to a goal space from another goal space). Poles can be blocked by port walls or other poles, but they can also move between the board's left and right edges as if the edges were connected. A pole completely blocked by the opponent teleports home.

To win the last solvent player must pass the start/finish line with at least $100.  This is hard to accomplish and most games end with everybody losing.

The game is currently being reprinted by On-Line-Products. The following information is from their website:

Unlike modern murder mystery party games, which are elaborate affairs that sometimes require extravagant character portrayals, The Jury Box is a more informal, easy to play party game. The players are members of a jury who get to examine evidence against an accused person. They each then try to unravel the case and decide if the defendant is guilty or innocent.

Each series of The Jury Box comes complete with six different court cases that you get to solve. The cases have an outline with state's evidence against the defendant, along with two pictures of the crime scene and ballots for the jurors to cast their verdicts. You even get the actual solutions to these realistic cases.

Object: To maximize your score and minimize your opponents scores by putting pieces in taller and smaller stacks, respectively.

You Need:

* Four Icehouse stashes of different colors.
    * An opaque bag (or other opaque container).
    * A 43 grid. A Volcano board or chess board with some squares blocked off works just fine.
    * Some paper and a pencil for tallying scores at the end of the game.

On your turn, take a piece out of the bag and put it on the board. When you put a piece on the board, it must point upward. Pieces are played by these rules:

* Any piece may be placed in a vacant space.
    * A smaller piece may be 'engulfed' by a larger piece if the smaller piece is resting directly on the board.
    * A piece of smaller or equal size may be placed on another piece of equal or greater size.

Once you have placed a piece, play passes to the left. The game ends when all pieces have been played. After this, all the stacks are scored. Stacks have a value equal to the point value of the pieces in the stack, multiplied by the number of pieces in the stack. Points are tallied separately by color. A piece that is 'engulfed' is scored by the color thats engulfing it, not by the 'owner' of the engulfed piece. Engulfed pieces do not count for being in a stack.

The player with the highest total at the end of the game wins.

Several variants to the rules are also available on the website.

Box contains three two-panel mounted, green-flocked boards combining to measure 3' x 2'.  Game includes a selection of terrain to use on these boards to create battlefields, including six different hills, two different villages, two different farms with farm fields, hedgerows, stone walls, roads, streams, rivers, two forests and a bridge.  Roads, streams, and the forest footprint are in colored felt.  Buildings are painted and cast from resin.  Tree bases are magnetized for secure storage inside the box.

Boxed set includes rules, charts, two rulers, two ten-sided dice, casualty/morale caps, command/rally counters, deployment/dummy markers scaled to unit base sizes, objective/line of communication markers, and two fully painted, based and flocked Napoleonic armies.

Each army consists of four line, one light and one elite infantry brigade; two light and one heavy cavalry brigade; three foot and one horse artillery batteries; and one General with two separate lieutenants used for command extension functions.  Each brigade includes a flag of its nationality.

Infantry is mounted four to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing about 2200 men.  Cavalry is mounted two to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing around 700 men.  Guns are mounted individually, one crew member for a field/horse battery and two crew for a heavy gun.  General is mounted with a foot figure; lieutenants are mounted individuals.

Figures in the standard starter set are painted Risk figures from the shako edition of Risk.  Additional painted brigades representing helmeted cavalry, lancers, etc. may be ordered from the producer.  Supplemental terrain boards and terrain elements are also available.

The rules are playable and concentrate on command and morale.  Units out of vision distance or line of sight are initially represented by hidden deployment markers, revealed as units come within sighting range.  Units may also be assigned to off-board flanking forces and/or reserves.

Initiative is determined each turn, as are available command points for each army.  Command points may be used either to activate units for movement and combat, or to rally shaken or demoralized units.  Army command diminishes as brigades are demoralized or destroyed.

The game system allows for considerable expansion and accommodates multiple players on a side.  Entire large battles can be gamed using this system and additional unit, but an interesting game can be played with as few as four or five brigades on a side.

21573,Triangulate,2001,4.5,1,2,2,2,30,30,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Pattern Building,"An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.

Triangulate is an abstract strategy board game that can be played with 'found objects.' In other words, it's a game, not unlike checkers or chess, but one that can be played with game pieces or other objects that you probably already have at home.

The first player decides which of their small pieces they would like to move first. In order to actually make the move, the player first takes one of their LARGE tokens and places it onto the square to which they intend to move a SMALL token. (The proposed square must be directly adjacent to the original square, touching on any side or corner) They then move their small token from its current position to the new square; placing it on top of the newly placed larger token. Then the next player takes his turn, etc. A player may move one of their small tokens onto a square already occupied by one of their own or one of their opponent's small token. In this case, the player does NOT place one of their large tokens in advance of the move, but simply places their small token on top of the other small token already in place. If this move is onto an opposing piece, that piece is not captured, but effectively blocked. Until the player on top moves their small token, the piece below may not move.

Play continues in this manner until one of the two players is able to Triangulate three of their own small pieces on a single square on the board.

In order to achieve this, Pavilion Cricket consists of three separate games:

1. Domestic Cricket
      This game covers domestic tour and one-day matches in England, Australia and the West Indies. A typical county match takes approx. 15 min. to play.

2. One-Day Cricket
      This game covers One-day Internationals and Domestic finals. More detailed than number 1., a typical game takes approx. 60 min. to play.

3. Test match Cricket
      This game provides a ball-by-ball simulation of a full five-day test match. As the most detailed of the three games, each day's play takes approx. 90 min. to play.

By using a combination of the three games, a full season or tour may be played on an ongoing basis.

The Teams Book provided details full squads of players for a broad range of teams; falling into three categories: Domestic, Current International (early 1990's, but later Team Books are available), and Modern Greats.

21578,Rodeo,1983,7.6,1,0,3,6,0,0,,American West Sports ,Betting/WageringRoll / Spin and Move,"The Original Rodeo Hexagame, a dice and bet game for the whole family

In turn, each player competes in of 6 Rodeo disciplines, whilst the others place bets on the outcome. An active player can earn good money by successfully completing the task at hand, but the real money will be made by the onlookers who wager wisely.

Cowboys who enter the hexagonal rodeo arena will be randomly assigned one of 6 events: Bull-Riding, Bronc-Riding, Barrel-Racing, Calf-Roping, Team-Roping or Steer-Wrestling. These typically are resolved by rolling a die and moving along a predetermined track until the active player completes the task, fails by landing on the wrong space in the races, or can't land on the required spot(s) before the cattle escapes out of the arena in the roping events.
 The overall winner of the game will be the one with the most money at the end of it. Exactly when that is has to be decided by the players themselves, as events can be repeated as long as players are willing to enter them, and bet on them.

Since all the tasks get resolved by die rolling alone, winning cowboys will have been riding little more than their luck, making the Rodeo setting nothing more than a novel theme for a dice betting game, rather than simulating the adrenaline-rush of a genuine wild west gathering,  where skillful cowboys strut their stuff.

On the upside, with detailed playing pieces and 6 different (and all short) events, your average dice betting game suddenly has become very atmospheric, reasonably varied, and does move on at a brisk pace. And even better, as players can keep betting during the races as long as they can find another player who takes them up on the counter-bet, bet money can move even faster than the bulls, triggering personal rivalry around the table that will make even the wildest rodeo-ride look tame in comparison.

This light-hearted simulation is aimed less at gamers and more at the family market, and the detail and simplicity of the rules will mean that it is probably most enjoyed by those with younger children to entertain. The suggested lowest age is 6, which might be a bit young to fully understand the complexities of even simple betting odds. There is no real upper limit to the amount of players that can join in, and the more the merrier the betting. But if all cowboys want their own piece, then 6 is the maximum number of entrants.

21579,Animal Tracks,1983,4.5,2,0,2,6,20,20,,Animals Maze ,Pattern BuildingTile Placement,"Animal Tracks, Make Tracks to Collect the Animals

A 4x4 grid is surrounded on all sides by 16 tiles with animals on them. Each tile shows a picture with a type of animal, either pigs, hens, sheep, or cows. Players get 2 track tiles each, which are placed (one each turn) on the grid to create connections (roads) between the animals. When a player places a track tile so that it connects 2 animal tiles of the same type, then those animal tiles are removed from the board and placed on that player's scoring stack. Empty spaces are filled with animal tiles from the draw stack, each player also draws a new track tile at the end of the turn and play continues until all animal tiles are collected or all track tiles are played. Track tiles may be placed on top of each other, and matching sets of animals may only be collected if the connection is made by establishing a new(!) route between them.

Each animal tile has one to three animals on it, and each player's end score is equivalent to the total amount of animals on the gained tiles. The one who collected most animals is the winner.

What appears to be a very simple tile-laying games with an appealing farmyard animal theme is quietly hiding a rather clever maze game that challenges children on multiple fronts. There are only four different track tiles in the game, yet there are so many ways to place these that a bewildering amount of new routes have to be considered. Visualizing the one that would connect two identical animal types, let alone spotting the most profitable one can be a challenge even for adults.

But kids love tiles, and kids love puzzles, and the rules are so intuitive that they easily get engrossed in an entertaining game. The best children games do far more than simple entertaining, and by having to match identical animals, create new routes between them, and consider the relative value of two matched tiles (2 hens and 3 hens is better than 1 sheep and 2 sheep) half an hour of fun is well spent indeed. There are 68 animals on offer, so even determining the final scores can be a quick math lesson.

The suggested age range is from 7 upwards, but it is such a good bridging game that it would suit even slightly younger children. For kids at the younger end of the spectrum, it might be simpler to settle for whoever has the highest animal stack wins, but even then there is enough left to make this a game worth considering.

Also known as Dierensporen in Dutch and Pistes d'Animaux in French.

After the defeat of the Japanese in the Pacific, America had to formulate a policy for Asia and the rest of the world. As allies of Ho Chi Minh's fighters against the Japanese, it is clear that the U.S. had several choices in Indochina. The decision to back the French, attempting to regain control of the region, led to America's eventual involvement, and all the consequences thereof. The war that ended in 1973 had led to all of the following: 57,661 U.S. servicemen dead, 2 million Vietnamese dead, the first military defeat for the U.S., internal turmoil in the U.S., distrust of the government and military, the devastation of much of Vietnam, and many other things.

Formed to control civilians rather than fight armed enemies, the Soviet NKVD and the much larger German Waffen SS each committed mass murders in the name of ideology and from simple animal barbarism. Knowing their well-deserved fate if captured, they often fought with suicidal fanaticism.

Sinister Forces brings background articles and scenarios covering these troops and their battles to the Panzer Grenadier game system. It is not playable by itself, but requires Eastern Front to play most of the scenarios, and Afrika Korps or Desert Rats to play all of them.

Scenarios take place on the Eastern Front. The SS troops are of generally lower quality than the corresponding German Army pieces of Eastern Front, reflecting the lower standards of training and recruitment for these political formations. Background articles place the scenarios in the full context of the war in Russia.

New weapons also appear. The SS wield huge 220mm mortars seized from the French army in 1940, French-made B1 heavy tanks, B1 tanks converted to carry flamethrowers, Soviet-made T-34 tanks, and new forms of transport: light SPW 250 half-tracks and fast Volkswagen personnel carriers, the famous Kubelwagen.

There are SS units included of high combat value: special pieces and scenarios for the Norwegian ski battalion and for the Finnish SS battalion.

In the game students are divided into small groups of 2 to 6 members, each playing a ministerial role in the government of six nations that correspond roughly to the real-life participants of the Korean War conflict.

The nations are:

Inland (N Korea)
Outland (S Korea)
Transania (Soviet Union)
Hameel (China)
New Zenith (the West)
and Nordo (India, the Third World?)

This game was originally released as a seven box set. Each nation receives its own box (as named above) of briefing materials. In addition, the Control box contains materials for the instructor to moderate the game.

In Dangerous Parallel, there are a number of different scenarios.  The one that I played is essentially the same as the Korean War.  Inland invades Outland who are aided by New Zenith.  After a vicious and successful counterattack, the players are asked to make the next move.  Will, for example, Hameel aid Inland, risking nuclear war if Transania becomes involved.

Each country has the following ministers:

Chief Minister
Defense Minister
Political Minister (Minister of Interior, or Police)
Foreign Minister
Foreign Intelligence Minister
Economics Minister
Minister of Information
Several Ambassadors

There is a requirement that the Foreign Minister is not the Chief Minister to allow for espionage.  Also, you can allow for multiple roles for each participant.

21628,1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks: Battle for the Ancient Robot,1985,6.03125,16,2,2,2,80,80,,Adventure Book Science Fiction Space Exploration ,Point to Point MovementVariable Player Powers,"A one-on-one book game with a sci-fi/adventure theme.  Each player is a champion of their star-faring race, trying to find pieces of the Ancient Robot, a powerful and dangerous artifact of a lost civilization.  The pieces of the Ancient Robot are scattered throughout the galaxy, and the players move from system to system to find them by choosing which page to turn to.  In their quest, they will encounter all sorts of harrowing adventures, battling or befriending strange monsters, collecting strange new items to improve their abilities, and may even run across each other....

The premise, as described by the books:

A million years before mankind invented fire or the Cybrtrons first oiled their gears, the Ancient Ones ruled the universe. For reasons lost in the mysteries of time, the Ancient Ones channeled all of their galaxy-spanning efforts into the building of one huge robot. There were twenty star systems in the realm of the Ancient Ones, and each one of the twenty was given the task of building one part of the massive robot.

The project was soon completed, the twenty parts constructed. The Ancient Ones had to bring the twenty parts to one central location and assemble the robot. But something went wrong -- perhaps a war between the systems, perhaps attack by some alien race. The Ancient Ones vanished. All that remained were the scattered parts of their robot.

One million years later, two parts of the Ancient Robot were recovered in different areas of the Milky Way galaxy. A team of humans discovered one part of the Ancient Robot in the year 2289 A.D., while exploring the planet Pluto. The Robot provided mankind with the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart marked with the location of the other nineteen parts.

At the same time, a civilization of robots also discovered a part of the Ancient Robot. Called Cybrtrons, they had overthrown their soft-skinned creators centuries before. They are now determined to rule the galaxy! The Ancient Robot part also gave the Cybrtrons the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart revealing the location of the other nineteen parts.

Both civilizations immediately decide to go in search of the Ancient Robot. Records of the Ancient Ones reveal that the Ancient Robot has the capability to design and build technological devices that will advance mankind a thousand years. The Ancient Robot is also capable of destroying anything in its path! With this device, the Cybrtrons know they can conquer the galaxy!

Both civilizations are sending their best pilots into space to search for the Ancient Robot. The Cybrtrons and the humans have become aware of each other. The search for the Ancient Robot has turned into a deadly race.

YOU are the leader of one of the two groups assigned to find the Ancient Robot!

Part of the series of 1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks.

21629,Tickityboo,2003,0,0,0,1,9,15,15,,Math Puzzle ,Tile Placement,"Tickityboo(tm)  is a game similar to Stubborn(tm), but with hexagonal tiles, and more of them.  The hexagonal tiles mean that each tile has six large triangles, each of a different color...Stubborn has only four large triangles and hence only four colors.  Each Tickityboo tile is therefore a member of 6 different numerical series.  
Despite its increased intricacy, Tickityboo is begun just like Stubborn, by placing the specially marked Starting Tile face up on the table.  Each player  then takes 9 tiles blindly from the remaining total of 143 tiles still face down on the table.   When there is more than one player they take turns, but unlike in Stubborn, in Tickityboo each player becomes vulnerable if they cannot place a tile, and the another player can move an overlooked tile, and discard one of their own tiles to the vulnerable player's pile. 
Like the other games in the Mining Order From Chaos(tm) series, Tickityboo is a great solitaire game.  It supports up to nine players, however, to make an engaging pastime for a small party or a third of a normal classroom.

The Battlebooks started out with characters from the Marvel Universe and later expanded into other comics.

Two cards were bound into the comic book. One listed the rules and identified the features of the game. The second card was the character's Maneuver Card which listed the actions the character could take in combat.

Gameplay was similar to Lost Worlds. Each player picks a character and game books are exchanged so each player has a book that depicts POV illustrations of the opponent attacking. Maneuvers are simultaneously selected and the matrix encoded into the books determines the results of each exchange.

Once more trouble in the class room, the pupils are busy with everything but their lessons. The teacher is doing his uttermost best to prevent disturbances. Unannounced tests are the most unpleasant means for that. But also tell-tales and careerists are on the side of the teacher. Only those who don't get caught can win the game.

For starters, every pupil gets a figurine and places it on a school bank of his choice on the board. The teacher places his figurine on the desk on the board. Teacher cards and pupil cards are shuffled in separate stacks. Every pupil gets 4 cards from the their stack. The teacher gets 4 cards from his stack.

The pupils get to play their cards before the teacher, they have to keep their card turned up side down. The teacher rolls the die after he has played his card. The die indicates how far the teacher can move in the class room. The pupil sitting next to the teacher has to show his card face up. Depending on the card this pupil gets minus point, a remark in the class book, or nothing at all.

After this all pupils and the teacher place their played card on the discard stack and draw a new card from their stack..
A round ends when the teacher has to play the end of the hour card. The next player (clockwise) becomes teacher for the next round. The game comes to an end when every player has played the teacher role and the last teacher has played the end of the hour card. The winner of the game is the player with the fewest minus points.

21659,Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place,1986,5.16667,6,2,2,8,90,90,,Economic Expansion for Base-game Negotiation ,Auction/BiddingDice RollingRoll / Spin and MoveSet CollectionTrading,"Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place is an unauthorized variant of Monopoly.  Published in the form of a trade paperback, it is designed to address what its authors describe as three problems with the game:

     It takes too long.
     There's too much luck.
     There's too much dead time.




They go about this by making eleven changes to the rules of the game.  The boldest of these are that the price to purchase a property landed on is doubled, and that a property may not be mortgaged but can instead be sold back to the bank for its mortgage value.  The game is changed immensely - it is no longer advisable (or even possible) for a player to buy outright every property landed on, and properties frequently go up for public or private auction.

In effect, this variant forces the players to make more difficult decisions, reducing the game's luck factor in favor of more emphasis on bidding and negotiation.

The train cards are played to the table in lines. The object is to move your station along a line of trains to the end of the train, simulating the train moving into the station (or leaving the station). Various event cards can be played, some of which allow your station to move forward 1 or more 'spaces' (train cards), or send other players stations backwards. Wild cards that can match any train or station type also exist.

This game first appeared in 1947. There are at least 2 editions of the game, one of which included fold out stations; one edition came in a blue and white box, the other in a red and white box. The Pepys second edition was published in 1955. The first edition included station cards that were folded within the box. The second edition only had stations the size of normal cards and the train liveries were updated.

Real trains are featured, from the LNER, GWR, SR, and LMS lines (London and North Eastern Railway, Great Western Railway, Southern Railway, London, Midland and Scottish Railway).

Secretly deploy the king, and all those who could become allied in a coup against him, including his wife, his son, two assassins, and countrymen of varied influence.  In addition to all those people who will hold their posts, you openly deploy five mobile spies.

Your spies reveal to you the identity of the face-down character cards below them.  You can permanently commit a spy in order to influence the character under the spy, so that character supports the coup against your opponent.  If, instead, your spy is on one of your opponent's assassins, you may attempt an assassination (even on your own countryman), in the hopes of getting your opponent's king.

Even if you can't assassinate your opponent's king, you can still win the game by amassing 25 influence points in support of your coup against the opposing king.  (The queen and prince are each worth 9, assassins are worthless, and the countrymen are worth 2 to 8 points.)  If neither player can pull off an assassination or coup d'etat, the game is a draw.

One player takes the role of Scoop, an ice cream vendor promoting his surprise ice creams.  Four wooden ice cream cups are used to hide stacks of three wooden counters each.  Each wooden counter represents a scoop of ice cream in a particular flavor--vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or mint--with all of the scoops of a particular flavor being hidden under a single ice cream cup.  The cups are then switched around--from 4 to 8 switches per round depending on what the players agree on beforehand--and the first player to Scoop's left tries to guess which cup a particular flavor (it's a little unclear from the rules, but apparently Scoop selects the flavor to be guessed) is under.  If they're correct, they get one of the scoops of that flavor, and they become Scoop (i.e. they get to switch the cups around) for the next round.  If they're incorrect, they lose one of their scoops from a previous round (if available) and the player to their left gets to guess.  Players have the option of passing if they don't want to risk losing a scoop.  At the end of the round (after either a player has guessed correctly or all players have passed or guessed incorrectly).  All of the cups are lifted and any lost scoops are returned to their respective stacks.  The game continues until all of the scoops have been won.  Cups with no scoops under them remain in the game.  The player with the most scoops (wooden tokens) is the winner.  The game comes with attractive wooden components, and ice cream vendor's hat to designate Scoop, and a sturdy box that's really quite a bit larger than necessary to hold everything.

It's a blast from the past; a game of fads, fashions and fun that will take you on a reminiscent ramble through some of the more memorable moments of the last few decades. Great entertainment for young and old alike!

Basically, each player answers a set of questions from cards relating to nostalgia in the UK: 1960s; 1970s; 1980s; TV and Film; Fads and Fashions; and then a catch-all subject Nostalgia Grab-Bag (or something like that, anyway).  The answers for the cards are in the rules booklet and everyone checks their score at the end, like a pub quiz.  And, like a pub quiz, many of the questions are deeply obscure, unless you have a remarkable knowledge of (and any interest whatsoever in) football, soap operas and sitcoms.

From the publisher:

This reminiscent ramble through the momentous events of the  Twentieth Century is a game of fads and fashions...... a timely document of the good, the bad, the funny and the frivolous!!!
From Mods to Punk Rockers; Hammer Horrors to Block Busters; historical events to hysterical clothes, you'll face questions on the weird and the wonderful from those now distant decades of The Sixties, The Seventies and The Eighties.
Bobbing ogs, feely-boppers and flares all make their claim in the momentary Madness Hall Of Fame......Whilst the prize for Pointless Pets is a close-run contest between Pet Logs, Pet Rocks, stick on Garfields and Cabbage Patch Dolls!!!
It's time to pull up those plastic chairs, light the lava lamps, crack open a Party Seven, pull on your pumps and take a memory-jigging jog through the dusty depths of your collective memories!!!

Players agree upon a set of cards to play with, and then select one each. Starting with the player in the most colorful clothes (!) each player throws the die and moves that many spaces around the board. There are five different types of space on the track:

1. Pick one piece from anywhere on the board
2. Pick two pieces from anywhere on the board
3. Pick 1 piece from zone 1 (or 2 or 3)
4. Place another player's piece back on the board
5. Helicopter space - Move anywhere on the track

The winner is the first person to their model.

The game box says for ages 7 and up, but my 6 year old plays it quite happily. There is no strategy, only the luck of the die roll. Within a set of the cards there are sufficient lego pieces on the board to build all the models, so there is no competition for pieces.

A game to introduce Lego fans to board games, but not one to get board gamers excited by Lego.

Play: One player draws an irregularly-shaped figure on the paper. That player must divide it into nine sections by drawing two horizontal and two vertical lines. The other player gets to draw one line. This line must start and end at an outside edge. Starting with the player who did not draw the bending line, take turns marking vacant spaces, one at a time. The game ends when there are no vacant spaces left to fill.

Winning: Score one point for every interior border shared by spaces that you have claimed. Shared corners (vertices) do not count as shared borders.

21697,Down in Flames Squadron Pack 1: Fighters,2005,7.5193,57,2.1111,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Aviation / Flight Card Game Expansion for Base-game Wargame World War II ,Hand ManagementSimulation,"(from GMT website:)

The one thing that Down in Flames series players are always looking for is additional aircraft for their favorite game series. So we have decided to satisfy that desire with our first C3i-DiF Squadron aircraft pack. This pack consists of 64 fighter aircraft cards, printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years. Most of the aircraft cards are NEW aircraft types, although we have included a few reprints (with corrected ratings) of aircraft that have appeared previously in one or more of the DiF Series games.

Included are such important aircraft as the British Typhoon and Tempest, the German Bf-109G-6/R6 and Fw-190F and the American P-63A Kingcobra (which was used extensively in combat by the Soviet air force). The pack also contains a number of more obscure but interesting aircraft, like the Rumanian IAR 80, the German TA-152H and the Polish PzL 24, the only fighter in the Greek inventory at the time of the Italian invasion in 1941. Speaking of the Italians, there are a number of Mussolini's fighters in the pack as well, including the Cr42 Falco, the M.C. 202 Folgore and the G.50bis Freccia. All of these planes are done in the upgraded graphic style of Corsairs and Hellcats, courtesy of Dave Lawrence, Martin Scott and Rodger MacGowan.

The package is wrapped in a ziplock format with an 11 x 17 (folded) cover/rulesbook. The front cover is graced with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous DiF Series style artwork, while the inside will contain the rules necessary to use the aircraft in DiF dogfights. Some of the rules will be reprints from Zero! and Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who only own the European Theatre DiF series volumes (Rise of the Luftwaffe and Eighth Air Force). There will also be a few new rules. For example, ace researcher Chris Janiec has come up with a way of modeling aircraft carrying a single, large caliber cannon, such as the P-39.

If this first C3i-DiF Squadron Pack proves to be popular, we're planning a series of these expansion packs. This is your chance to expand your Down in Flames series air force and add new aircraft cards at a very low price. Enjoy the games!

The game was developed in Denmark the 90's by 3 friends with a common passion for the WWI Knights of the Air.

The game features true 3-D action with accurate models of all the greatest planes of this era: SPADs, Sopwiths, Fokkers, Pfalzes, Nieuports, Hannovers, Rumplers, Albatrosses, Bristols, Gothas, Zeppelins, S.Es...

The game represents individual plane movement and individual pilots. 
Each plane is represented by a 1/350 scale model with at 360 deg. nose mount that allows the model to be positioned in all directions. The nose mount is then itself mounted on a four foot long pole made of carbon fibre. The plan can then be moved up and down the pole, thus denoting actual height - No altitude markers here. The pole is sharpened and set directly into the foam gameboards. See pictures.

Each plane also has a Cockpit sheet to which the Pilot sheet is attached and where the data (and possible special rules)on each plane type is represented. On the cockpit sheet also contains a speed indicator telling the current speed of the plane, and indicating the amount of energy the plane currently posses. This energy level tells how tigth the plane can turn and its ability to climb or dive. Going fast equals the ability to zoom high up, but turns are wide. Going slow allows for tighter turning but severely limits your ability to get out of trouble by zoom climbing and thus limits the tactical options. In this game speed is life.

Piloting skill can make planes turn tigther than their speed normally allows for, but this drains speed and at higher speeds also stresses the airframe, thus creating a risk of breaking of important bits such as the wings.

The Cockpit sheet is also where you record damage to the plane: Structural damage, damage to maneuverability, armament, engine and so on.

Each pilot has a set of 3 basic skills: Awareness (situational awareness), Piloting (ability to make tight turns, avoid or recover from spins and stalls)  and Gunnery (hitting your target). A pilots skills are decided by rolling 2d6+6. Pilots also has 2 attributes: Fortitude (hit points and ability to figth when wounded) and Luck (Denotes number of dice re-rolls and Used to check for collisions) found by rolling 3d6. With experience pilots gain better skills as well as possible Ace abilities such as Divine luck, Deflection shooting, Aerobatics and so on.

Skill and attribute checks are done with a d20 against a basic target number (for example Skill or Attribute level) modified by conditions (for example deflection angle or target speed). The difference between the target number needed and a the number rolled on a successful check denotes the success level which is then carried on as a modifier to the damage roll.

The full rules including, missions and Cockpit panels and more can be downloaded for free here:http://icog.dk/ICOG/Download.html

1/350 scale planes can be acquired as 3D prints(or hand build in styrene as you see on many of the pictures). A large selection of planes is available for the game. Links to these can be found on the ICOG homepage: http://icog.dk/ICOG/Links.html

It was included as the series rulebook for Galaxy-Foundation Games' other strategic games (Deliverance From Beyond the Stars, The Xenon Empire's Star Wars: Crusade Against the War-Lords, and The Collodian Conspiracy: Science Against Chaos Unleashed), and also appears to have been sold separately. It may have come with some Combat Operations Plots when sold separately (these were used in all of GFG's strategic games).

The cover of the Battle Manual is done in the style of a military field manual. Under the obligatory number (OBM-76A-171) it states For Fleet Commanders and Officers of Flag Rank. The manual is also marked CLASSIFIED DATA, noting under official regulations, any attempt to reproduce, pass on, reveal, or place in possession of unauthorized personnel constitutes a violation of military law under the military code, espionage and sabotage acts and is punishable under the penalties regarding treason.

The Combat Operations Plot is a large chart designed to assist in setting the current configuration of your starship. There are 23 separate Operations Plots displayed, each specifying the various ship settings for the forthcoming turn.

The values specified in an Operations Plot include Offensive Power Level, Defensive Power Level, Shield Potential, Counter-Attack Factor, Defense Factor, Sensor Screen Penetration, and Rate of Warp (acceleration and deceleration). Each Operations Plot is given a descriptive name, ranging from the straightforward Full Shields and Total Offensive Weapons Deployment, to more convoluted selections such as Special High Speed Evasive Action Plan for 'A' Type Beta Battle Cruisers or 'CR' Type 'Gammas'.

What really makes the game fun is the amount of research that Mr. Gundt put into the game. Rules for ten different types  of gladiators and a great plethora of weaponry and armor are included with the game. Perhaps the most interesting are the rules included for the Andabates type gladiator, a gladiator that fought blind with a full-head helmet, sort of like Luke Skywalker in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.

Game comes in a small 9 x 6 1/2 x 7/8 box with a cover illustration of a well-dressed Victorian family playing a map-and-pin flags boardgame of the war.

The cardstock hex map measures 16 1/2 x 11 5/8 and depicts the region of conflict running from cape Town and Port Elizabeth in the south to Mateking in the west, the Rhodesian border in the north and the port of Lourenco Marques in the east.

Map has one-inch hexes featuring Clear, Hill, Railway, River, and Mountain terrain plus economic centers and ports.  The mounted, pre-cut 3/4 counters featuring forty green Boer Commandos of various strengths, Command Flags (three per player), two Natives, thirty-five Gold (Supplies), twenty red British Infantry brigades, twelve red British Cavalry brigades, and five red British Garrisons plus a Turn Marker.  Two D6 are also included.

Unit counters feature, as appropriate, a drawing of a Boer horseman firing at the gallop, native shields, national flags, British lancer, British infantry, and a field gun with crew (for garrisons).  Counters include deployment location or turn of appearance, combat strength, and movement allowance.  Historical unit identifications are also included.

Normal game length is fifteen turns (victory determined by holding the most economic production centers) or, optionally, thirty-six turns (pursuing the bittereinder to the last counter; if one survives to the end, the Boers win).

Rules cover reinforcements, the British War Chest, Natives, Neutrals, Railways, Sea and Off-map Movement, Multi-hex combat, Sieges, and the assymetrical nature of opposing forces.

Movement is handled in a distinctive way.  Each turn, Boer and British players alternate placing a flag on the map (numbered between One and Six).  After placement, players alternate moving units adjacent to these flags.  Units must stop if they move adjacent to a hostile unit.  Following this Consolidation Movement, Combat occurs.

After Combat, surviving units may engage in Dispersal Movement, which is the opposite of Consolidation Movement.  Movement to and from flags takes place sequentially in the order of numbered flags.

Optionally, players may place their flags simultaneously rather than sequentially; in this instance, players plot the hex number where each flag will be placed.  Another option allows for random flag draws from a cup.

Combat is determined by odds ration and a singld D6 die roll.  The resulting number indicates the Butcher's Bill imposed upon either the S (smaller force) or L (larger force) engaged.  Losses are in units removed; the Boer player may retreat in lieu of taking losses if his units may retreat the full amount (one or two) and not move next to any British or native unit.  Gold (supplies) may not retreat and may be captured.

In Delta, after entering their initial pieces by a free placement, players alternate moving pieces of their own color on the 5x5 board at least two spaces (vertically, horizontally or diagonally), then placing a new piece on the space last passed over by the moving piece. The goal is to create a line of four pieces in your own color or to prevent the other player from being able to move. The winner scores one point for each empty space for making a line or one point for stalemating the opponent. Individual rounds are brief, and several rounds are usually played in a series with the overall winner being the first to reach a pre-determined number of points (such as 100).

Neo-Delta is similar, except it is played on the 6x6 board, and either / both players may use the third color piece (placed by the first player on the first or second move) to form their line of four. Draws are possible.

The Action Game of Unbearable Fun!

AGES: 7 to Adult
OBJECT: Get rid of your cards in hand, but also avoid getting stuck with the discard pile cards when the SPROING tray goes SPROING!
EQUIPMENT: 1 Special SPROING pop-up discard tray
54 Numbered Cards consisting of: 32 Blue Cards and 22 Yellow Cards
1 Bag
6 Multi-Colored Plastic Chips

Each player in turn discards a card in the special SPROING tray before it pops up. Yellow action cards add excitement to the game by directing players to roll dice, find color chips in a bag or count out loud before discarding a card.

This curious game relies on a coiled plastic tray that may be pressed down to become held in place by a sucker. The sucker holds the tray down for about 1.5 minutes (according to the makers) before suddenly releasing the tray, allowing it to pop up and scatter all cards that happened to be on it.

Players try to play a card that is either a '1' or a number higher than the top card on the tray. The blue cards are numbered from 1 to 10, with lots more 1s than other numbers. The yellow cards are numbered from 1 to 9, but also have actions described on them that must be performed by the next player. The next player has to complete the actions before they are allowed to play their card. The actions could require players to count (for example, from Sproing 1 to Sproing 10), roll a specific combination on two special dice (each die has 3 blank sides and 3 sides showing a coiled spring), or draw a chip of a specified color from an opaque bag.

Anyone unfortunate enough to have the tray pop up during their turn has to keep all scattered cards, which count as points against the player who owns them. The player with the lowest number of points wins.

Players must add letters or words to the existing word-pattern, as indicated by the die.  (For example, a die roll of +2 means they must add two letters to the board, with the result being a still-legitimate crossword configuration.)

A player can always, in lieu of rolling the die, select from a deck of cards that define a general type of thing (e.g. birds, sports, words beginning with 'R') The player must add a word that meets the criterion of the card.

Points are scored for number of letters in newly formed words, with standard Scrabble-like bonus spaces applying.  First player to set number of points wins the game.

Each player gets a space-o-meter to record the number of millions of miles they have traveled on each leg of the journey.  Movement is governed by a spaceship spinner that advances from 10 to 90 million miles per turn.  To claim a planet, you have to be the first to have your mileage hit the orbit range of a planet.  For example, to claim Mercury, you have to hit the 100 to 130 million mile range.  If you go over, you have to reverse your direction and  start subtracting mileage for each spin.

Once all planets are claimed, you add up the value of your planets.  These range from 10 billion dollars for Mercury's gold to 50 billion dollars for Saturn's plutonium.  These are very generous sums for 1951!

This game has rich retro decco graphics.  The artwork is very similar to the 2005 Zathura: Adventure is Waiting.  In fact, the spaceships are nearly identical.

The game is played on a 36 by 36 grid with the Earth at the center.  Players get fuel cards numbered 1 through 10 to control their movement.  Each turn, you play one fuel card to move your ship that number of squares either horizontally or vertically, but not both.
There are also two fuel ships.  Every player on his turn rolls a die and moves one of the fuel ships.  If you land next to a fuel ship, you can retrieve any one used fuel card.  When you are out of fuel, you can only move one square per turn. You also retrieve any 3 used fuel cards on every planet you land on.
Each planet has a series of 10 to 12 dots that describe its entry/exit orbit.  To leave Earth, you have to follow the 12 orbit dots before you enter the vertical and horizontal grid of open space.  Likewise, when you want to land on a planet, you have to start on the outermost orbit dot and follow the orbit down to the planet's surface.  Sorry, no transporters in this game.

What a mess!  The vehicles belonging to the Koala Brothers and their friends are completely mixed up and little by little, as night falls, the way home is hard to find.  Where is the scooter? Who knows where Frank and Busters house is?  Your mission is to help the friends to get themselves and their vehicles back to the right house.

The game is comprised of five small boards representing the homes of the Koala Brothers and their friends. Each house has three spaces on it.  The (two) Koala brothers and four of their friends appear on six red counters and their preferred means of transport are represented on five blue counters (the koala brothers fly a twin seater plane).

At the start of the game the counters are mixed up, one of the red ones removed, and the remaining ten distributed at random between the houses.

Players take it in turns to roll a special die and take actions accordingly:

    If it shows a number then the player moves a piece of his choice the number of free spaces indicated on the die.  Movement can be in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.
    If it shows an eye the player can secretly look at a counter of his/her choice.
    If it shows an arrow the player selects a playing piece of his/her choice and turns it up so that everyone can see.

Players may also gamble tokens by secretly peeking at counters.  If the counter is at the right house then it wins tokens, if not it loses tokens.

Play proceeds until all the friends and their vehicles are face up in the right location.  The player with the greatest number of tokens is the winner.

21836,Scrambled Heads!,1996,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,,Deduction Party Game ,,"SCRAMBLED HEADS! - The Crazy Clues Game! is a similar game to HEADBANZ and others of that ilk.

Players take it in turns to be the 'Head Case' by placing a headpiece on their head. A card is placed in the headpiece by another player such that it can be seen by all the players except the one actually wearing the headpiece.

The game card shows three subjects in three different categories - Food and Drink, Entertainment and Miscellaneous.  The subject is something that should be familiar to all the players and could be anything from a famous film star to a wild animal.

The 'Head Case' selects whether he wishes clues on the category on the top, middle or bottom row of his card, and is then informed of which particular category the subject belongs to.

The other players then take it in turns to offer clues as to what the subject is.  Clues should be relevant to the subject but somewhat distant and slightly cryptic.  Clues should not be derived from part of the subject title.  The 'Head Case' has 10 seconds to try and guess the text on the card at which point the next player gives another clue.

Tokens are added into a central pile to indicate how many clues have been given - these tokens having been evenly distributed amongst the players at the start of the game. If the 'Head Case' guesses the subject then the player that gave the last clue must collect all the tokens.  A player also gains them if he is unable to provide a suitable clue.  In the event of the 'Head Case' not guessing the answer within 12 clues he fails and collects all the tokens from the pile,

Another player is then selected as the 'Head Case' and the while process is repeated.  Play continues until one of the players runs out of tokens or when all players agree to stop.

The object of Bedlam is to maneuver you and your partner into the most compromising positions possible.

To start, each player sits on the Bedlam sheet. Sensuous bedroom attire and a bottle of wine can add pleasure to the game.

Each player takes turns spinning the Bedlam spinner. When the spinner points to one of the four colors the player who spun may move a hand or foot to that color. Knees and elbows may touch the sheet.

If the spinner points to Anything Goes, that player is given complete freedom of movement over the entire Bedlam sheet. This player may position their body any place on the game sheet as long as the other player(s) do not move from their positions. When the player is satisfied with their position, play resumes.

If a player spins Your Request, the player who spun may position the other players on the Bedlam sheet in any position desired as long as they do not move from their position.

When the players have reached compromising positions, Bedlam is declared and you take it from there. Have fun and remember, 'It's not whether you win or lose but Where you play the game'.

The basic game comes with the first book in the series and the rest of the books will have small expansions to the game.

The basic game plays a little like the old Titan boardgame, with each player having secret armies on the map. Each player got one treasure hidden in one of his armies, and the goal is to get both of them to Rai (the capital in the middle of the board) and keep them there for 3 turns.

The two players will try to get his armies into the most favorable terrain which is different for each unit. Each army got one leader and two units (hidden at the start of the game) and the combat is simple dice rolling. The board is made in the same way as in Settlers of Catan, and  uses hexes with various terrain.

Kampen om Rai was published as a base set in book 1. Followed by 10 sequels with 10 expansions total.
Some expansions inlcude more players, more cards and the veteran unit extra cards.

The rules describe three games to be played with these components, all of which are memory/matching games:

1) One card is placed face down for each animal in the bag.  Players draw an animal from the bag and then attempt to flip over the corresponding card.  Success allows the player to retain the card and animal cracker, while failure requires the player to return the cracker to the bag and flip the card back over.

2) As above, but two cards are placed for each animal and players must attempt to match the drawn cracker with both matching cards.

3) All cards are placed face-down in a stack.  Players draw a card from the stack and then attempt to retrieve the matching animal cracker from the bag by feel (without looking).  Success allows the player to keep the matching set, while failure requires that the animal be returned to the bag.

In all cases, the winner is the player with the most card/cracker sets.

Best played while nibbling on Barnum's Animals Crackers.

Game is played with two six-sided dice, but while I have pictures of the case and board, I can find no explantion of game play other than this quote from Deconstructing Sondheim, a March 8, 1993 New Yorker article by Stephen Schiff:

When you enter his five-story town house in midtown Manhattan, the first thing you notice, besides an enormous black poodle named Max, is his antique-game collection: on the walls, in glass museum cases, on various low tables. Most of the items look faintly sinister: here is something called Schimmel, or Ball and Hammer and here an inscrutable British concoction, Squails, and, behind the sofa, his earliest acquisitionthe ghastly New and Fashionable Game of the Jew, a dice game devised in 1811 that, according to Sondheim, taught kids to be anti-Semitic. But all the games you see here are very nice to look at and real boring, he adds. This thing about gamesI'm not really fascinated with games.

--
Looks to be a variation of Gluckshaus.  Roll both dice and pay the amount rolled onto the space of the same value.  If there is something already on the space, collect it instead.  Rolling a 7 always pays to the Jew space.  Rolling a 12 collects all the counters on the board.

Players also have a small hand of five cards that provide certain benefits when played.  Unlike the other two games, Checkered Flag simulates stock car racing.

Given that speeds are more constant in stock car racing, there are only three speed choices; 60, 120 and 180 miles per hour.  At the beginning of the race and after a pit stop, cars start off at 60.  In the two turns, the maximum speed is 120.  The turns drive the primary choices available, as some lanes provide a shorter path than others.  The choice lanes have a cost in fuel usage or tire wear.  The first car to complete three laps wins the race.

Sure Shot Baseball is a two person game played much the same way as outdoor baseball.  The game consists of nine innings of 3 outs each.  The pitcher rolls a plastic marble down a slide and it heads toward a batter controlled by their opponent.  The batter tries to hit the ball out of the stadium by turning a batting knob.  If it goes out of the unique up-curved field the fielder then tries to catch it.  Singles, doubles, triples, foul balls, and home runs are determined where the ball goes over the wall.  The runners stay in their team dugouts until it is time to position them on the field.

Each batter gets only one pitch. A missed pitch counts as one out.  Each team gets three outs and then players change positions.  Players play nine innings and whomever has the most runs wins.

There are a few other simple rules.  The game is quite tricky to learn and play competitively.  But it is definitely a fun experience if you enjoy baseball!!

(from the publisher:)

Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. BSO, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or heavy weapons). No CRTs, no siree!

The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They dont 'drive' the game and they can be left out, if youre so inclined.)  The cards are turned into a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards or rally units. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.

The cards, themselves, give the players 'Opportunities', from using their Tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Reaction movement, to appearances by Patton and Monty.

Playing time for BITTER VICTORY has averaged 3 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 8 pages, including a section on Solitaire play!

Available in English or French

Components:

    1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)
    1 A1 map of Sicily 
    20 colored Opportunity Cards 
    224 counters (NATO Symbols) 
    1 Aid Cards




The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva.

21977,Pyramid (Battlestar Galactica),1980,6.1,10,3,2,5,0,0,,Bluffing Card Game Movies / TV / Radio theme Party Game ,Betting/WageringHand ManagementSet Collection,"Pyramid (Battlestar Galactica) is a card game based on the 1970s television series Battlestar Galactica. It was depicted as leisure activity for the characters in the television show. Later on, rules and decks of pyramid playing cards were made available commercially to fans of the show. Both are currently out of print.
The game uses a 55 count deck of hexagonal cards separated into three kinds of suits and three ranks as well as a 'capstone' card which is used as a wild card. The game is played very similarly to poker. Players are dealt hands and place bets based on how strong their hand is. There is a discard between bets and players reveal their hands to determine the winner of that round.

Winning hands are determined by a number of factors including suit, rank and matching sets. There are approximately fourteen different hand combinations possible in the game. There is no 'end' to the game, players merely quit at their leisure.

The deck consists of 55 hexagonal cards, which is divided into 3 suits: purple, green and orange. Purple ranks highest and orange ranks lowers. The deck also contains a Capstone (*).

Each suit contains:
- 3 First level cards
- 6 Second level cards
- 9 Third level cards

How To Play
Each player is dealt 6 cards. If a player feels a better hand is possible, he may discard up to 4 cards and receive replacements from the dealer. This may only be done once per hand, much the same as Draw Poker. Players then construct their best possible pyramid and compare to the other player hands to determine the winner.
Ranks of Hands
A pyramid is made up of at least three cards.

1. First level pyramid consist of 2 third level, and 1 second level card.

2. Second level pyramid consist of 3 third level, and 2 second level card.

3. Third level pyramid consist of 3 third level, 2 second level cards, and 1 first level card.

4. Any of the above may be considered perfect when all of the cards used are of the same color. (Perfect pyramids rank higher than non-perfect pyramids.)

5. If two or more perfect pyramids are the same level, then the highest suit would win. (NOTE: Only perfect pyramids can be ranked by suit; non-perfect pyramids are considered to have no suit.)

6. If two or more pyramids are still equal, then the persons play another hand to decide the winner.


    ) The Capstone can be used in place of the first level card in a Perfect third level pyramid. This is the highest of ALL PYRAMIDS!



        ) The Capstone may also be used as a wild card to replace any card in any pyramid.

21978,Prompt,1998,3.66667,3,1.5,2,6,30,30,,Card Game Memory Trivia ,MemorySet Collection,"Taken from the back of the box:

Played with gloriously illustrated Character and Prompt cards and a variety of quotations from Shakespeare.

This is a light game of memory and card collection requiring a familiarity with Shakespeare's plays.  It is best suited to play after a dinner party.  Match Prompt and Character cards to your Quotation cards to create sets.  The first to match all their cards into sets wins.  There are 30 sets.

There are two levels of difficulty, which give different methods of play.

The easy method requires players to complete a Shakespeare quote by filling in the missing word(s) on a Quote card, from a Prompt card and matching them to a Character card.  The mechanics of acquiring cards is similar to the children's card game Go Fish.

In the advanced game the mechanics are similar to Happy Families but a good knowledge of Shakespeare is required to get you the cards you desire.  If attempting to obtain a Quote card from another player one has to recite the quote in full and be Dead Letter Perfect.

In both types of game the mechanics may well be based on children's games, but it is unlikely to appeal to children due to the subject matter.

A tennis simulation game, with different boards, but similar mechanics, for playing singles and doubles. The game is played on a board with 81 boxes on each side of the net, grouped in 9 sections. When you play a shot, you call the section (1-9) that you are aiming at, and then roll 2 D6 to see which box in that area it lands in (1, 12 = fault, 2-11 - numbered sectors). If the box is next to a line, 2D6 are rolled to see if the ball is called out. Players can only play a shot if they can move to the ball to play it. The number of boxes that you can move depends on the type of shot played by your opponent (volley, power shot, lob), and where on the court you are. You also can move some boxes after your shot to set for the next one.

The rules do not specify what length of game, etc., to play. Presumably you would decide to play a set, or a tiebreak, or whatever, and use tennis scoring to decide who won.

The game board shows the entire length of the caterpillar Ramba. Her carnival costume (wooden pieces) are hidden in a large cloth bag. They fit on the game board in pre-determined ways. Each turn, the players simultaneously reach into the bag to find the next matching puzzle piece. The winner is the player who places the most pieces.

Ramba Samba demands tactile awareness in a fun-filled way. Because only the player who can feel the matching pieces fastest will win.

Each player has a scoreboard (which records their 'crime', 'information', 'battle' and 'reward'), Alliance card and Karma table.  A Boss is selected (the player with the most criminal convictions!).  The Boss selects three Karma cards, takes one and passes two to the player on the left.  The process is repeated until all players have two cards.  All players roll the dice and place a mission card in the corresponding numbered area.

Players place Alliance cards next to the missions they select.  Where more than one player attempts a mission they simultaneously show a thumbs up/thumbs down sign to declare whether they will co-operate or fight.  If players co-operate they divide the reward.  If players fight they divide into the groups, all who voted to co-operate (if any) are one group, fighters become separate groups of one.  Battles are determines by dice roll plus Battle influence.  The winner takes the reward.  The first player to collect ten rewards wins the game.

A Bloody Business: the Battle for Hue, Tet 1968 covers the attack on the old Imperial capital of Hue by forces of the North Vietnamese Army and South Vietnamese insurgents of the National Liberation Front during the Tet Offensive. The Communist forces hoped a popular uprising by the oppressed people in South Vietnam would lead to a general uprising and overthrow of the puppet regime supported by the United States. 
The city of Hue was the only city to be completely occupied by the communist forces during the massive offensive, and was the scene of violent and close-quarter fighting that waged for nearly a month, from January 31st to February 25th, 1968. The general uprising never occurred, and in fact the communist's disappointment led to atrocities when they massacred hundreds of collaborators after they took control. The fighting to retake control of the city and oust the NVA and VC devastated the city and Imperial Palace, symbolizing the tragic and confused nature of the war.

Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players will have capabilities to inflict harm upon their opponent, while also having liabilities to protect. Contestants will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.

Game Scale: The map scale is about 350-400 yards per inch. 
Each combat unit represents a platoon (25 to 30 men, 2 tanks or 6 APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers) and artillery batteries (M-109, Katyusha rockets, and mortars). 
A game turn represents 2-3 days of time.

22002,CHECKCHESS RoundBoard,1991,6.75,2,0,2,2,0,0,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Grid Movement,"CHECKCHESS RoundBoard contains standard sets of chessmen and checkers, but as the name implies the real star is the game board.  The circular board consists of eight rings of eight spaces each.  Each ring corresponds to one of the eight ranks on a standard chessboard, and each radially-aligned group of spaces corresponds to a file.  (They're even labeled 1-8 from outside to inside and a-h counterclockwise, and the rulebook calls them squares despite their curved shape.)

The pieces are set up with one player on the outside of the circle facing in and the other in the center facing out (but otherwise exactly as in ordinary chess or checkers) and the rules of those games are unchanged except that file a and file h are considered adjacent for the purposes of movement.  This is equivalent to the variant in which pieces are allowed to move off the right side of a square chess board onto the left and vice versa, but on the round board all legally-adjacent spaces are also physically adjacent.

From the designer's notes included with the game:

An engineer by profession, I have always had a fascination with the game of chess.  As a member of my high school chess team, I played hooky from school to strengthen my game.

In the 1960's the concept of a round board interested me as a novelty.  However, some 25 years later I made a serious study of that novelty and concluded that the round board is a major evolutionary advancement in the games of chess and checkers.  I hope you share my belief and enjoy your games on CHECKCHESS RoundBoard(TM).

There are sixteen playing pieces, eight white and eight black. Within the set of eight there are four short pieces and four long ones. If a long piece is placed in a deep hole and short piece in a shallow hole, the the tops of the two pieces will be level.

The object of the game is to form a cluster before your opponent does. A cluster is when all of your pieces (one player has white and the other black) are in a group all next to each other and all of the tops of the pieces are at the same level.

Essentially, players only know the positions of their own pieces and have to make inferences based on what the umpire tells them (for example, that a move is impossible, or a capture has been made on a specific square).

22009,The Money Game,1912,5,1,0,5,11,0,0,,Bluffing Card Game Economic Educational Math Negotiation ,Auction/BiddingHand ManagementStock HoldingTrading,"A boxed set of cards used in three games intended to explain, and educate about, monetary and banking systems.

The box contains two sets of cards - one set represents machine parts, the other bank notes - and score sheets.

Both games are based around the premise of an engineer shipwrecked on an island - he has a limited source of gold.  The islanders have machine parts from an earlier shipwreck.

In the first game one player represents the engineer and the others the islanders.  The engineer wants to buy machine parts (collect complete sets), but the cost of buying parts goes up the more he buys in one go from any one islander.  The islanders want to get as much of his money as they can, and one of them can win by 'breaking' the engineers bank by holding more notes than he can cover with his supply of gold.

In the second game the islanders are purchasing goods produced by the engineer by bidding. In this game the engineer does not score, but merely acts as banker.  The winner is the islander who has managed to accumulate the most merchandise

The third game represents an experiment by our one-time shipwrecked engineer, now financier.  He has a contract with the islanders by which he pays 200.00 for a complete eneterprise (set of machine cards). To ensure that they can find and supply the complete enterprises to him he lends them money which they can use to bargain with amongst themselves.
This game is meant to illustrate the mutual indebtedness which is the characteristic of banking, and involves considerable amounts of maths.

In 1928 there was a real bookcase edition submitted. Half of the book is the story of the game, the stories of the 3 game variants and long rules explanations with examples. Also there are many quotes from people recommanding this game.
The other half is a neatly made storage for the game components, everything made of good quality.
The first copyright mentionend in this bookcase edition is 1912, so the games origin must be in this year.
