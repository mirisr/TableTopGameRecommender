205867,Bohnanza: Das Duell,2016,7.53488,43,1,2,2,45,45,,Card Game ,,"Bohnanza  Das Duell: Give as good as you get!

What was that thing about the gift horse? In this two-player variant of Bohnanza, both bean farmers give each other gifts of beans they cant use themselves  to make life harder for their opponent, if possible. Trying to fulfill their secret bo(h)nus requirements, they both need to keep a vigilant eye on the other players bean fields. Give as good as you get in Bohnanza  Das Duell, there can be only one winner!

How to play Bohnanza  Das Duell:
Both duelists have bean field mats in front of themselves to plant their beans on. Between them, there is a row of eight gift cards. Each player holds five hand cards and three bo(h)nus cards with secret objectives. Playing the bean duel, you have the option of planting more than one type of bean in the same field, but when you plant a different bean than the one youve planted before, it has to have the next highest number than the one before. When harvesting your beans, its the beanometer of the last card youve planted that counts.
At the start of each turn, the active player plants two beans from their hand and turns over bean cards as usual. Instead of trading, however, they offer their opponent one bean as a gift by pushing this bean types gift card in their direction. The other player can accept the gift or decline it, but if they dont take it, they have to offer a gift in return. You are allowed to bluff, but it may cost you if your bluff is called! Important: Only the first player to accept a gift actually receives the bean card in question. After this exchange, plant all beans you have received and turned over, then draw new cards.
Bo(h)nus cards can be fulfilled at any time when the required combination of beans printed on the card can be found in any bean field. Fulfilling an objective earns you bean dollars and the brand new bean cents. When the draw pile is used up, the player with the most bean dollars wins the game.

Bohnanza  Das Duell is a variant of the popular bean trading game Bohnanza designed exclusively for two players. The gifting rules and bo(h)nus cards facilitate interaction between the two players and give fans something new to try out.

A game for the 150th anniversary of Saalbau/Frankfurt.

When the great cities of Europe tore down their fortified walls in the 19th Century, a stunning construction boom took place. Sprawling parks, stately residential quarters and industrial district sprang up around the old Medieval city centres. During the so-called Founding Time, the cities burghers took the lead in cultural affairs and laid the groundwork for many museums, foundations and institutions  many of which still exist today.

Players act as burghers of that time. Through large and small building projects, they try to turn Frankfurt am Main into a cultural and industrial hub. The player who collects the most Fame Points doing so wins the game.

The game consists of one 4-inch die (the Ogre Cybertank) and a set of 16 smaller dice representing lesser units. One side plays the Ogre; the other side picks 30+X points of units, where X is the cost of the smallest unit.
Each turn (starting with the non-Ogre player - call them the Defender), the player may either activate a die on the table or throw a new die onto the table and immediately activate it. Each die has 8 sides with variable levels of attack and defense, as well as special powers. Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.
When a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).
Instead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.
If the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.
The winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).

     Hat-Trick: 'Players' Expansion (2016)




Hat-Trick is a highly-tactical football card game for two players (managers) that simulates a complete football (soccer) match.

Managers use player-cards to make a football pitch and move their players, while two identical sets of action cards let them perform various actions: short passes, long balls or dribblings. Putting the ball in the final line of the pitch triggers a Scoring Opportunity phase, which is a mini-game in itself and is performed using shooting and goalkeeping cards.

The game contains 32 ready-to-play national teams of variable strength. Moreover, it is possible to customize your own teams based on any club in the world.

A third game is about answering rather easy questions, that are really tricky if you have no time to think about it. So for example: How many vertex has a cube? A lot of people will answer 6 instead of 8.

The mini-games are chosen randomly. The players score points in all these games. After the chosen number of mini-games is played, the one with the highest score is the winner.

Flying from cloud to cloud and from surprise to surprise searching precious stars, an unexpected journey awaits.

The Little Prince: Rising to the Stars brings you in a journey from the Grandfather's house to the Little Prince's planet. It is a point-to-point movement game, in which your goal is to collect stars.

You move your plane by playing one of the fox cards in your hand, and every player starts with the same set of cards (eight cards numbered 1-5, with duplicates of 2, 3 and 4). Whoever is farthest back on the path to the Little Prince's planet is the active player, and this player plays one card from hand, moving at least one cloud and up to the number of clouds shown on the card. If you land on a star cloud, you take a star from the reserve; if you land on a telescope cloud, you flip one of the tokens at Grandfather's house to see what happens; if you land on a bird cloud, you take one card from Grandfather's deck, which provide different types of movement. If you arrive on a cloud where an opponent's plane sits, you take a card at random from that opponent's hand and give him in return a card of your choice.

When you cross one of the three connecting boards, you take one of the story tiles next to it, with these tiles holding 1-5 stars. Collect both the fox and Little Prince, and you earn eight stars for this pair instead of only two.

If you manage to make it all the way to the Little Prince's planet  and you'll need to pick up extra movement cards in order to do so  you receive a star-filled paper plane, with the quickest players receiving the most stars. In the end, whoever collects the most stars wins.

Your goal is to use your guides to move clients up and down the mountain safely before the storm arrives. Each turn, you are limited in the number of climbers you can move. Guides can move clients farther, but your clients outnumber your guides. An event chit is drawn that must be either purchased out of a limited amount of Prestige Points or it goes on the Storm Track, hastening the arrival of the storm. The storm phase decreases movement and increases the difficulty of managing the clients.

Points are scored for clients that reach the summit and live to return to base camp.

From the publisher:

As the owner of an exotic travel company that specializes in extreme sporting activities, you provide clients with a way to reach the top of the world, Mt. Everest. Unfortunately, several other competing agencies have opened up, each with the goal of becoming the most prestigious and successful travel company.

You control the guides and clients attempting a dangerous ascent to the summit of Everest as a deadly storm approaches. The more clients that reach the summit and live to tell the tale, the greater your company's prestige and fortune. Can you triumph over a Disaster on Everest?

Control the movement of your guides and climbers as they navigate the treacherous ridges, ascend the technically-challenging Hillary Step, and strive to reach the top of the world! Maximize the use of your guides' special abilities to safely escort your clients as the storm approaches. Manage the events on the mountain or lose your well-paying important clients to the inevitable disasters that await.

Advanced and optional game rules add client traits and unique travel company abilities.

They bring fine carpets to the market and share delicious mango juice while praying men honor the holy cows, and the children tease mischievous monkeys and gasp at the snake charmers. But the main event of the festival is the elephant race. Young men and women of the region spend days painting joyous and reverent decorations on their elephant partners for this one moment when they can surge through the crowds of festive villagers, push and shove their way past other racing pachyderms, and brave the tiger-filled forests to win honor for themselves and their proud elephant friends. The bell rings, the elephants trumpet their excitement, and the race begins!

Formula E is a game in which 3 to 6 players race their elephant pawns through an Indian village, over treacherous mountains, and across parched deserts seeking to be the first one to complete the course.

The primary game mechanism in Formula E is hand management as players use their hand of cards to advance their elephants through the course. Elephants move in a unique manner  they push elephants in front of them until those elephants hit an obstacle, then the active elephant pushes sideways until a path is clear for it to move forward again. Certain move-adjusting cards and tactical-screwage cards can be played to trigger events like diagonal movement, obstacle movement, and nasty little screw-your-opponents effects. Elephant racing is not, necessarily, a sport of honor!

Space Movers is a cooperative sci-fi adventure set in the year 2201. In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.

Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UOs power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.

To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)

- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic
How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a players last attempt to change any previous die results.

- Comic Book Included
The story begins in the Comic book Finding Liberty that will be included with the game. Objective cards that match the Comic continue the story as you play the game.

3818,Alias,1995,5.78562,660,1.3077,4,12,60,60,Party,Party Game Racing Trivia Word Game ,ActingPartnershipsPoint to Point Movement,"Alias consists of many cards, each card has 6 words written on it. Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: Silver Medal). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.

Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The explainer must change every turn. Each team gets a figure representing them on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take cards from the pack (not showing it to the other team member(s)) and explain the words on every card that have the same number as the space their figure landed on. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the  word that is written on card  by using sentences to describe the word.  For example, if the word is Silver Medal, a player can say something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games. But if other team member says just Medal, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn. Variations: opposites and/or foreign words are allowed.

Based on Alias' success, Tactic has kept publishing re-implemented versions of the same basegame, such as Fame Alias, Junior Alias, Junior Alias: Travel, Muumi Alias, Family Alias,  Party Alias,  High School Musical Party Alias, and has also licensed Noteability as Musiikki Alias.

143323,Stak Bots,2013,6.40125,120,1.625,2,6,10,10,,Card Game ,Hand Management,"Simple but fun game based on playing from a hand of cards representing robots. Each has special powers and affects the stack (stak) in different ways, making it more tactical than a simple rock-paper-scissors exercise.

The game functions by giving each player a stack of cards as well as a hand.  Each turn, players take a new card from the shared draw pile and may add a face-up card to the stack, trash a card from the stack or from their hand.  When a card is played, it will have entry effect that may operate on the stack ordering of the player or opponent.

Once all playing/trashing is finished for a turn, the player may attack the card on top of an opponent's stack with the top card of their own.  The battle itself is quite simple and just a matter of comparing power, although assuming your bot survives its first battle, it can go on to attack the newly revealed card underneath.  The real tactical consideration goes into the pre-attack stack manipulation phase.

There is an open turn structure which allows players to carry out actions in any order and any number of times. This means they can react to the often unpredictable results of long entry effect chains, or to cards that their opponents play defensively during your turn.

The game is also customisable: you can adjust the complexity or game length by adding more Staks for each player or by changing basic game mechanics.

606,Pico 2,1997,5.89776,263,1.1562,2,2,5,5,,Card Game ,Hand ManagementSimultaneous Action Selection,"from game review:

The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of pips. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.

In The Doge Ship, the players play the role of the most skilled shipbuilders of Venice who are called by the Doge to cooperate on the construction of the new ship. Each player has to build parts of the Ship in order to earn victory points, but also Gondolas to get money, and Barriers for the protection of the shipyard and the city. The task is not easy: At the beginning of each round, the cost of the actions might change, as well as the demands of the Doge. When the construction of the ship is finished, only one will be the winner and will gain the favour of the Doge.

In this game players have to manage their five actions per round competing with other players on these available. Players can work on a part of the Doge Ship to gain VP, on Gondolas to make money, or on Barriers to protect Venice from High Water effects and save their shipyard. Manage money is fundamental as all materials costs something. The game ends when the Doge Ship is complete.

You can set aside any dice you want to keep, but if one of the players notices that his opponent has rolled a Yuck symbol (before the opponent can reroll it), then he can yell out Yuck! and force that player to reroll any dice she's set aside. If any non-active player notices that both players have a Yuck symbol at the same time, she can yell Chop! and that ends their turn immediately, with the dice passing to the next players.

Whoever completes a dish first keeps that card, and the first player to collect 4-6 cards (depending on the number of players) wins.

This game is a simulation of real-world events. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position such as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. This gives Players a chance to change history. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.

New and improved ways are challenging traditional values and, with the wave of renaissance sweeping through, you will not be spared.

With great power comes great responsibility to provide stability and protection, resulting in a new golden age. Endure the tides of time, and leave an epic impression of your civilization upon the heritage of mankind.

Guns  Steel: Renaissance is a standalone expansion for Guns  Steel, providing new cards and new mechanisms that can be played by itself, or combined with the base game to provide a rich and dynamic adventure throughout history. Here's the overview of a player's turn during the game:


    Resource Phase
        Play a card face-down as a resource card.
    
    Development Phase
        Play a card face-up as a development card.
    
    Purchase Phase
        May buy one card from supply.
    
    End of Turn Phase
        0 or 1 card in hand: 
             Retrieve cards to hand.
        
        2 or more cards in hand: Do nothing.
        Check if you can place glory cubes on a wonder.
    


The game ends when all of the wonders are taken, or when all space age cards have been bought, or when a player has 15 VP tokens. At this point, whoever has the most VP wins.

109077,Iron Sky: The Board Game,2012,6.44891,92,2.6667,2,6,120,120,,Movies / TV / Radio theme Science Fiction ,Area Control / Area InfluenceVariable Player Powers,"In 1945 the Nazis went to the Moon; in 2018 they come back with a vengeance! Get ready, for the Fourth Reich is about to land on your table!

Iron Sky: The Board Game is based on the full-length feature film Iron Sky, a dark sci-fi comedy set in the year 2018. The Nazis have completed the construction of a massive invasion fleet of flying saucers and space zeppelins, and arrive at Earth's door with only one thing in their mind: total world dominance!

Iron Sky: The Board Game puts players in charge of the most epic battle of all history. The objective is to gather as many victory points for your side as possible. Both the attacking and defending players are in command of a specific sector of the battlefield, and each player is awarded with a personal score based on how the battle fares  but no one commander can win the whole war. The players need to help each other out of tight spots, for each commander has a different area of expertise, with weaker proficiency in other areas. Only by working together can the players prevent the enemy from exploiting these weaknesses, and only by working together can they bring the enemy to their knees!

In addition to mixing cooperation with competition, the core of the gameplay ensures that the players practically have no downtime at all. You are either attacking or defending all the time, eliminating the need to wait for your turn.

Iron Sky: The Board Game takes a different approach to the universe of Iron Sky. The movie may focus on the main characters, but the board game gives players direct control over the whole global war effort  and there's no way of knowing which side will emerge victorious. Lock and load  the Moon Nazis are coming!

To set up, place 12 hexagonal tiles in a dogbone shape as specified in the rulebook, then place one token for each player on their starting locations. On a turn, a player takes two actions (possibly the same action twice) from this list of options:


    Place a land tile adjacent to any existing tile.
    Place a worker adjacent to any of your workers already on the game board.
    Move one of your workers to an adjacent empty space.
    Jump an opponent's worker and land on an empty space, removing that worker from play.
    Remove two of your workers from the board to remove an opponent's worker from any space.
    Remove two of your workers from the board to place one of your workers in any empty space.
    Remove one of your tower layers from the board.


If at any time during play you have a circle of six of your workers surrounding an empty space, place the first layer of one of your towers in that space. Your ring of workers must remain in place for two additional turns for the remaining two layers to be added to the tower; if your ring is disrupted, you can complete it later to continue the tower-building. If you completely surround an opponent's tower, you can remove the top level of that tower from the board.

In addition to building three complete towers, a player can also win by eliminating all of the opponent's workers from the game board.

18058,Anno Domini: Spiel des Jahres,2004,6.37717,92,1.5,2,8,30,30,,Bluffing Card Game Humor Party Game Trivia ,Card Drafting,"Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.
If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.

Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this aint no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because its full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.

Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.

The Set Anno Domini - Spiel des Jahres contains events related to the games of the year, the sometimes odd jury decisions and almost anything, true boardgame geeks should love. It can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.

Part of the Anno Domini series

Gunship: First Strike! is Escape Pod Games' core release in a planned series of tactical space combat games. Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.

What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players build at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are defensive minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a Carrier Killer complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!

In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick pit stop. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.

As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week. Don't let the enemy find the Shipyard where your damaged Destroyers limped home last time  if he does, they're toast!

From the back of the box Aces High is a simultaneous movement game that puts you in the cockpit, with only your own skill between you and your opponent's triumphant cry of Flamer! .
Includes data on 72 different types of aircraft. The data includes information on Speed, flying qualities, armament, ability to absorb punishment, etc.

Aces High, although not as detailed as Wings, includes rules for stalls, spins, ropey (unreliable) engines, aircrew quality, spotting, archie (anti-aircraft fire), and more.
Aces High even has rules for different types of missions, from photo-reconnaissance to balloon busting to bombing.

The number of maneuvers is limited to banks, turns, sideslips, and half-loops. For example, there are no rules for Immelman turns or barrel-rolls, but the Immelman is accomplished just as in real life... a half-roll followed by continuous banking from the inverted position back to the upright position; a barrel roll is accomplished by a combination of banking and altitude changes during otherwise forward-flight.

There is an interesting rule for ace pilots where the ace pilot can withhold (i.e. not write a movement plot for) a certain number of movement points. After the non-aces have completed their entire movement plot then the ace's can plot out the rest of their move and therefore react to the less-skilled pilots actions. The number of points the ace can withhold is based on the 'grade' of the pilot with a 'grade 5' pilot unable to withhold any points to a 'grade 1' pilot being able to withhold 3.

The game board depicts the monopolies found in the original game, with the property groups color-coded as in Monopoly. Each property group has a given dollar value, which you can collect by rolling the dice and collecting that group.

On a turn, you roll ten dice, set aside any die reading Go, to or jail, then set aside any color group dice that you wish. If the Go, to and jail dice are set aside, your turn ends immediately, and you score nothing. Otherwise you can choose to either (1) stop and score for what you've rolled or (2) roll again with any dice not set aside, once again setting aside the Go, to or jail dice, etc. The dice have a couple of Wild faces, and you can use at most one Wild in a color group. (If you roll the proper color, you can replace a Wild die in a group and roll that die again on a later turn.)

If you stop, you score for all completed color groups and one incomplete color group. Your goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined dollar amount or to have the most money at the end of a pre-set number of turns.

Monopoly Express  an updated version of this game that was first released in the UK and Europe, then later in the U.S.  alters the gameplay as follows:


     The policeman from the Go To Jail corner of the board game replaces the words Go, to and jail.
     One blank face on one of the policeman dice depicts a green GO arrow. A player earns $200 each time he rolls GO, but he loses this money if he busts due to policemen. 
     The game includes an eleventh House/Hotel die that can earn (or lose) a player Houses (worth $1,000 each), earn Hotels (worth $5,000, but only if a player has already earned four houses) and a Get Out Of Jail Free side that negates a policeman (including a policeman that would bust a player). This die cannot be rolled until a player completes a property group (i.e., neither railroads nor utilities).
     The Wild faces are replaced by the Chance ? logo; the ? act as a Wild, but unlike a Wild it cannot be replaced.
     The first player to have at least $15,000 wins immediately; players don't complete the round.

137498,Breaking the Chains: War in the South China Sea,2014,7.24074,54,3,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Modern Warfare Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"publisher's description

Breaking the Chains (BtC) simulates a hypothetical future military conflict over the South China and East China Seas around the year 2021. Conflicting claims of sovereignty have roiled those near seas since the Cold War. After decades of patient diplomacy, Beijing's new navy could offer military options for finally asserting sovereignty over prizes within the First Island Chain - that string of islands which runs from the Ryukus south through Taiwan, the Philippines and then curls back to the mainland via Malaysia. BtC presumes that China comes to blows with a Southeast Asian country in a conflict that could expand to possibly include: Australia, India, Japan, the United States as well as a variety of Southeast Asian nations. However, beyond China and one South East Asian nation, the exact composition of opposing coalitions is not predetermined but rather a function of the decisions players make as the game unfolds.

Two or more people play BtC with two reference cards, dice, and about 350 counters on a 22 X 34 map where each hex spans about 70 nautical miles (80 land miles) and each turn represents one day of real time. Players alternate maneuvering air, ground and naval units for up to 14 nations to resolve battles with a universal strike mechanism that applies across all types of combat; missile defense capabilities are central to survival. Air units represent from 30-90 aircraft each, most ground units are regiments, and naval units are small groups of surface ships/submarines or individual aircraft carriers. Specialized chit play simulates black ops, cyber warfare and various political developments.

BtC is solitaire friendly. The naval operations which dominate play are based on a roll-to-evade model rather than search-to-find model. That means, owing to a battle space awash in electromagnetic emissions, enemy positions - except for motionless submarines - are assumed to be known unless a last-minute dice roll determines a potential target has evaded detection. So there is no hidden movement to stifle solitaire play; and the hidden placement of submarines can be forgone. Finally, the special chits that govern black ops can be played at random to further enable solo game play.

22843,War in the Pacific (second edition),2006,7.69979,52,4.9091,2,6,480,480,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-CounterSimulation,"On Sunday, 7 December 1941, the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, was attacked by Japanese aircraft. For the next four years, Allied task forces engaged elements of the Imperial Japanese fleet throughout the ocean. Marines and army units began their program of island-hopping, wresting from the Japanese the empire that they had expanded in every direction.

War in the Pacific is a multi-level simulation of the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. The game enables players to recreate the entire course of the war, form the opening Japanese attack on 7 December, 1941 to the climatic Allied assaults in the closing days of 1945. Representing some 30% of the globe, the strategic maps let players move and engage in combat on all levels: air, ground and naval. War in the Pacific is not a simple game; there are a number of rules and concepts that will, at first, be unfamiliar to a majority of players. But playing through smaller map sections and scenarios enables the player to become familiar with the mechanics of the game.

This is a reprint edition which substantially expanded the original's components.  Components: 7 full size (22 x 34) strategic maps in full color, new tactical maps with nearly 338 individual islands for new ground units to fight over, 32 die-cut counter sheets, nearly 9,000 counters showing all types of units from the Pacific Theater, rule books, chart books and assorted displays and player aid charts

The rules have undergone significant change with greatly increased emphasis on detail  in combat while removing the detailed logistics system that was the focus of the old game and replacing it with a command point system modeled after Victory Games' Pacific War.

The order of battle is significantly more detailed. Leaders on many levels (and whose combat performance may be unpredictable), often serve to limit players' ability to affect the outcome of every battle to the Nth degree. A player's assignment of the right task force commander (for the right force at the right time), may spell the difference between a tactical victory and defeat.

The ground combat system has been completely revised, substituting a step-loss system adapted from VG's Pacific War. Pitched battles on islands and atolls are now resolved, including maneuver, on expanded tactical maps in six different scales, rather than simply being abstractly represented in a single hex on the strategic maps.

War in the Pacific's original air and naval systems are retained, in their essence, albeit with substantial modifications and above all added chrome in combat. Thus the game still feels like the original in those two aspects.

The game comes with the grand campaign and some small introductory battle scenarios.

30287,Ghost for Sale,2007,5.95616,224,2.0667,3,5,40,40,,Card Game ,Auction/Bidding,"Buying castles in Scotland can turn out to be excellent business. Even more so when, at the same time, you can provide tourists with these lands attractions: natural beauties? Oh no, no, rather offering them scary ghost infestations!!! Some eccentric characters fight in an auction to be assigned castles and manors. This, in the hope that presences will not be too numerous! Even if a castle without ghosts may be found useless, on the contrary one which is too populated will end up terrorizing tourists and being valueless...

Every player, after having seen the various castles, can declare what was seen, by showing his signs picture or ghost.
Were there gloomy presences or only old and powdery family portraits? But beware, not all declarations are reliable: many players could lie... or perhaps all of them?

In the first phase players must decide whether in that very turn they will lie or tell always the truth.
Mrs Truelight could help everyone to find out actual results of such decisions, but she is greedy and therefore she will reveal precious indications only to best bidders.

Caution is vital: the ones who pay more money too early will turn out having less funds to offer in the second phase auction for castles. Shall we have enough money to steal best ones to our competitors? Every castle has a score according to the number of ghosts by whom it is haunted.

The player who succeeds in guessing where ghosts are and their exact number will achieve optimum business, becoming able to buy what he/she wants in a fairly relaxed mode and allowing himself/herself even the luxury to mislead adversaries with fake offers.

Ghost for sale is a clever deductive game, with a subtle bluffing component, for 3 to 5 players, suitable for all the families, but with a strategy component that will not leave indifferent even most experienced gamers. In the box there are 8 special cards to be used for special auctions, which constitute a set for playing advanced rules games and which, randomly combined to the various castles and manors, guarantee rounds which are always exciting and different.

It is a two-player game, with one player controlling the American and British forces and the other the German and Italian forces.

The maps display the harsh terrain of French North Africa, from the wooded coastal region to the mountainous inland region into the sand dune and wadi infested wastelands of the Sahara Desert. The maps cover North Africa from the Safi-Casablanca region to Tripoli in Libya; they include the Allied and Axis base areas in Gibraltar, Southern Sardinia, and Western Sicily.

The counters represent the diverse forces engaged in North Africa: American, British, Free French, German, Indian, Italian, New Zealander, and Vichy French. Ground forces range in strength from armored divisions down to commando battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 50 aircraft; with both sides committing the best available aircraft, German Fw 190A's and Me 109G's fight for air superiority against British Spitfire IX's and American P-38G's.

The rules are the Europa rules for desert warfare; they are the same as the rules to Western Desert, with additions for the special features of Operation Torch. The rules cover the important elements of operations in Africa: armor effects, antitank abilities, supply considerations, air power, and shipping troops and supplies. Special operations in the campaign are covered in detail: parachute drops, amphibious landings, and commando actions. Political rules cover the volatile situation in French North Africa: the Vichy French army's response in North Africa can range from full co-operation with the Allies to determined resistance to the invasion.

Torch is playable by itself or in combination with the other Europa game on North Africa: Western Desert. In fact, the rules set, titled War in the Desert, provides the rules, charts, and orders of battle for the entire North African and Near Eastern theater of World War II. The rules link three Europa games - Western Desert, The Near East, and Torch - to show the struggle for this theatre from December 1940 through May 1943. A seperate rules set includes the instructions and orders of battle for playing Torch by itself.

112118,RED,2011,7.07845,58,2,3,3,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Pattern BuildingTile Placement,"RED is a three-colored tile-laying game for three players. The three colors in the game are black, white, and red, and each player will be a different color. Each tile has a background color and a different-colored circle in the middle. There are 6 different combinations and 5 small tiles and 1 large tile for each combination.

Players place tiles on the table trying to connect groups of their border color and groups of their circle color.

RULES

Place all the tiles face-up in a pool, leaving room to play the game.

Each player is assigned one of the three colors by some agreeable method and takes the corresponding counter; the counters just show which player is which color. The order of play is White player, then Black, then Red. Players take turns placing any tile from the pool on the playing surface according to the following rules:

- Tiles must be placed so that they align with an imaginary grid of squares the size of the small tiles.

- White cannot play a large tile on the first turn.

- Except for the obvious exception of the first tile, each new tile must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one small tile (i.e. must touch a small tile). Just having the corners touch isn't good enough.

- A large tile cannot be placed orthogonally adjacent to another large tile (that is, no two large tiles can touch each other, except at the corners).

The game ends when there are no available moves.

SCORING

Small tiles count as 1 point, and large tiles count as 2 points.

Find the largest connected group of tiles with your border color, and then find the largest connected group of tiles with your circle color. Multiply these two numbers to determine your score.

The player with the most points wins. If two players tie, the third player wins! If all three tie, play again!

The rules include a variant for 2 players.

(This was the last of the three liberation wars fought between Cuba and Spain; the previous wars were the Ten Years' War (1868-1878) and the Little War (1879-1880). One player controls the forces of the Spanish colonial government, fighting to retain Cuba; the other player controls the Cuban rebels fighting for their independence.

Gameplay represents the main insurgency and counterinsurgency operations that took place, and players must make key strategic decisions to achieve their objectives while balancing their resources and preventing their opponent from doing the same.

There are event cards that help and hinder both players; disease, ambushes, assassinations, and the reactions of the American press and government. Steamships, railroads, telegraphs were all common, but there were no radios, almost no automobiles, and no airplanes. Newspapers and magazines were the cutting edge of media, so print was king.

As the Spanish player, can you maintain control of the island, keep the economy going (based on sugarcane plantations) and keep the U.S. out of the fight? Or, as the Cubans, can you stop the Spanish efforts and gain your independence.? Play Cuba: The Splendid Little War and find out!

The main idea is that players answer to each question by playing number cards from their hands. On his turn, a player chooses a question from one of the question categories. After the question has been read out loud, all players choose their answer by playing cards face down on the table. All answers are revealed simultaneously. Each question has an answer between 1-100 and player's answer is the sum of the numbers he played. The player whose answer is closest to the correct answer, wins the question card for himself/herself but loses the number cards he/she played. Players may also play 'pass'-card and skip the question, but get to draw new number cards instead.

At the end of the game, players calculate their scores: players get points from won question cards and from hidden score cards that are dealt in the beginning of the game. During the game, players may influence what is the value of each question category at the end of the game - category's value depends on how many questions has been asked from that category. The game comes with eight question categories, from which five are chosen for each game. The player with the most points at the end of the game, is the winner!

Arvuutin offers a fast paced and fun trivia-experience for all people! Arvuutin will be published in Finnish and is available fall 2010 in Finland.

Each ingredient takes a certain amount of time to prepare and player order is rearranged each round to reflect time taken, so players must time their actions just right to make sure they get the ingredients they most want.

To build a pie, players splay filling cards on top of crusts cards, and even toppings on top of the fillings. Players have to decide when they want to box/score a pie as is or try to compete for a majority in scored cards with Influencers(the Higher-ups).

(The game's setting comes from the children's nursery song Donguri Korokoro (どんぐりころころ), in which acorns roll down from the hills into the ponds, first excitedly playing with the loaches  a type of freshwater fish  only to then pine for the mountain left behind. The last line of the song: He cried and the loach didn't know what to do.)

Each player starts with a few chips, each worth a point. The 16-card deck  which consists of two loaches (worth 0), four ponds (worth -1 or -2) and ten acorns (worth 1-5)  is shuffled, then a number of cards equal to the number of players are laid face-up. Each player receives a hand of 3-4 cards.

On a turn, a player either places a card from his hand into one of the columns or claims one of the columns. When placing a card, he can lay it face-up (taking one chip from the bank) or face-down (placing one of his chips on the card); when taking a column, it must have at least two cards and at most six.

After taking a column, the player sums the cards in that column, with a loach turning the negative ponds positive and with two of the acorns worth either 1 or 5 at the player's discretion. If the column's sum is between 0-6, the player takes that many chips from the bank; if more than 6 or less than 0, he pays the difference to the bank. This player is then out of the round, while the others continue to play cards or take columns.

A round ends when no columns remain, columns with only one card remain, or someone scores 6 chips from a column; in the latter case, the round ends immediately, and no one else scores anything. Players then start a new round. When the bank empties or a player has 20 or more chips, players complete the current round, then the player with the most chips wins!

At Port Republic, after some of the bitterest fighting in Jackson's experience, he managed to rout General Shield's lead brigades.

The Governor issued a desperate plea for help.  You play one of the best and bravest Adventurers in the world called to Transylvania to break the curse.  Your goal is to find the Knowledge to break the curse over Transylvania but beware, the Knowledge you seek may just turn you into one of the terrible Monsters you have come to destroy.

Transylvania: Curses  Traitors is a heavily themed adventure and exploration game utilizing a modular board, variable player powers, hand management, and dice rolling.

Paths to victory include:  1. Solving the curse of Transylvania by finding the right combination of Knowledge cards and returning your pawn to the Church Tile.  2.  Becoming a Monster (vampire, werewolf, or zombie) by collecting Transformation cards and then killing half the other players.  3. Killing a Monster as an Adventurer.

Game play:  The board consists of sixteen 6 x 6 tiles representing places in Transylvania such as the Church, Graveyard, and Castle.  Adventurers start on the Church Tile and explore uncovering new tiles.  Each tile contains token spaces which are opportunities to perform challenges of strength, mental acuity, and spiritual fortitude.  A successful challenge results in the reward of a Quest card.  The Quest deck contains the Knowledge cards needed to break the curse.  While exploring Adventurers will also encounter Events.  Failure of Events leads to injury and/or death while success leads to additional rewards.  If Adventurers collect Transformation cards plus a card that activates the Transformation card, they become a Vampire, Werewolf, or Zombie.  The goal of the game immediately changes from seeking Knowledge to eliminating the other players by attacking them.

No miniatures are needed. All you need is the book, a pencil, two six sided dice, and grid paper.

You choose four character types from the classic classes (warrior, wizard, rogue, halfling, dwarf, barbarian, cleric, elf), equip them, and start adventuring in dungeons created by dice rolls and by your choices. When you enter a room, you generate its content on a series of random tables. You will meet monsters, fight them, hopefully defeat them (or decide that discretion is the better part of valor!), you'll manage your resources (healing, spells, life points, equipment), grab treasure, dodge traps, find clues, and even accept quests from the monsters you meet. Your characters can level up and become better at what they do, but it will not be easy.

What the game is not:

It is NOT a miniature game. You may use miniatures to remember your characters' marching order if you wish, but that's it.

It is NOT a roleplaying game. You may run it as a simple cooperative, GM-less game if you want.

It is not a game-book or a choose-your-own-adventure book. There is no prose to read or numbered sections to go to, even if we could do something like that in a supplement.

157779,Barragoon,2014,7.20208,48,2.8,2,2,90,90,,Abstract Strategy ,Grid Movement,"Barragoon is a fascinating, completely strategic game without any random factor. Complexity and variety of this game with all its unexpected turns will inspire you!

The process:
Both players use their tactical skills to move their tiles and arrange the barragoon pieces to enable them to capture all their opponent`s tiles or to impede their opponent`s progress. 
A player has lost when he no longer has any tiles that he can move.

The barragoon piece:
The barragoon piece is the central element of the game. Each of its side shows another symbol. It blocks or frees the tiles to be moved in specific directions, depending on the direction indicated by the uppermost symbol. If a barragoon piece is captured, it can be placed again on the board at a free chosen position. By this, the players can block or attack the opponent or save their own tiles.

The clou: 
Each time a tile is captured, two new, additional barragoon pieces have to be put on the board. By this, the board becomes more and more crowded and the risk to get locked up increases. At the same time the chance to beat the opponent increases as well.

Thunder's Edge is a science-fiction board game of politics, strategy and giant mecha for two to five players. Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.

from review by Nickjost:
Play begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.

There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in transit are moved to orbit. Units in orbit can be deployed to the board. This introduces a minimum one turn delay from when an item is purchased to when it can be deployed.

The Red Dragon Inn: Gambling I'm In! is a game about the games that the heroes play when they gamble at the Red Dragon Inn. Now, players of The Red Dragon Inn, The Red Dragon Inn 2, The Red Dragon Inn 3, and The Red Dragon Inn 4 can play out an actual round of gambling when they play the Gambling? I'm In! card! Even better, the gambling games also can be played on their own as standalone games, or as part of your RPG, or LARP. The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.

This card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.

The deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).

There are five base games included and are as follows:


     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.
     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. 
     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.
     Den of Thieves - No dice. Hands are dealt and players use the special abilities of each character to influence hand weight and scoring.
     The Wheel (and The Clock) - No dice. Players try to guess what cards others are collecting in order to gain points and win the round.


When combined with The Red Dragon games, when a player plays the Gambling, I'm in! card, the player may decide to choose any game from the list to play instead of the normal gambling rules. Special rules are included for each variation when combining this with the normal game.

There will be other variations available as Slugfest has invited players to create their own games with the deck and the ones deemed best will be included in later rules updates.

Such a move, they hoped, would bring the Americans to battle.

The United States Navy needed no special inducement to fight its nation's enemies. Two American aircraft carriers met one small and two large Japanese carriers in the world's first battle between these powerful new warships. For the first time in naval history, a major battle was decided with no warship of either fleet even sighting an enemy ship directly. Aircraft were the new measure of naval power.

Coral Sea is the new introductory boxed game for the Second World War at Sea series. It covers this key battle and is intended as a gateway for players new to the world's most popular series of naval boardgames. The Japanese player must establish new bases in New Guinea and at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands; the American player must stop them. Forces are very closely balanced, and victory will rest with the player who can best make use of his or her resources.

The 22x17-inch operational map covers the Coral Sea off northeastern Australia as well as surrounding waters. Players maneuver their task forces on this map and search for one another with aircraft, submarines and surface ships. When contact is made, player moves to the tactical map.

The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ships capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.

While the game retained some of the features of the original game, it also removed a number of abilities and interactions deemed too confusing for the novice player.  Though a number of the cards in portal were direct counterparts to cards in the regular-run of Magic: the Gathering, gone were named abilities like Trample, Banding, -walk (though Three Kingdoms did add the ability Horsemanship, which is almost but not quite flying).  Additionally, the game cut back on cards that could be played on another player's turn (i.e. instants and interrupts), leading to a greater focus on creatures and not spell interactions to achieve victory.

Portal cards are recognizable from core and expansion sets of Magic: the Gathering by the expansion symbol, as well as a bolder and larger font in the text box, and symbols next to the attack and defense numbers of creatures.

Portal was printed in three editions:

When a creature attacks a player and isn't blocked, that creature breaks one of that player's shields. Each time a player's shield is broken, the player puts the shield into his hand. You win the game if on of your creatures attacks your opponent when he has no shields left (as long as your creature isn't blocked).

Beyond the reach of Allied intelligence and bomber commands, the Germans establish a secret facility, where a terrifying weapon is being tested. V-2, Hitler's Wunderwaffe, a ballistic missile able to wipe London from the map and win the war, bringing Britain to her knees. But the deepest secrets of German war technology are revealed by the UK's staunchest allies - the Poles...

Czas Honoru: Operacja Most III  a.k.a. Days of Honor: Operation Wildhorn III  is a fast-paced, tactical card wargame for two players. The first player takes the role of the Polish commander. His goal is to collect fragments from rockets test-fired from the German missile base. The second player takes the role of the German commander and is trying to protect the secrets of the rocket testing area.

The game lasts four turns. Each turn begins with a missile test, which scatters new fragments of the rocket in the peripheral area surrounding the testing ground. Players alternately take turns during which they place their units on the table and perform actions. Players use scouts to collect missile fragments, but they need to be protected by soldiers and partisans because enemy contact can lead to combat. These actions are supported by elite units: Polish Unseen and Silent commandos and German SS Stormtroopers, who are able to penetrate enemy lines. In addition, players build a network of command and support units, which allows them to effectively carry out their actions.

Players also affect the course of the game during their opponent's moves, playing cards for immediate effects. And each side has a set of unique events, e.g., Germans can use their logistical advantages while Poles can hide, and even evacuate rocket fragments to England! To determine combat and exploration results, players each use a six-sided die, but they have many opportunities to modify the results, so a good plan should work even with bad luck.

At the end of the game, the player with more rocket parts wins. This means the player successfully stole (Polish) or concealed (German) the secrets of the V-2 weapon.

This is a two player wargame of intermediate complexity designed by Joseph Miranda. One player controls the Communists, the other the Free World Forces. Each game turn equals one week, and each hexagon represents 25 miles. The units of maneuver for both sides range from battalions up through regiments, brigades and full divisions. The game includes one full-size (34x22) large-hex map and 280 half-inch, NATO-style, counters. All of South Vietnam, plus the border regions of Cambodia, Laos and North Vietnam are on the map, and the orders of battle include all the units of both sides that participated historically.

There are two scenarios: one short, with only five game turns in the autumn of 1965, and the other long, covering the entire period of the early American war with a full 20 game turns. The rules contain approximately 16,000 words, which works out to two experienced players being able to get through the campaign game in one long session of about six to eight hours.

Taking the places of Spartacus (-73 to -71), Tryphon (-104 to -101) or Eunus (-139 to -132), during the three Servile Wars which shook the Roman Empire, defy the Roman Consuls (Crassus, Pompey and others) by liberating slaves, ravaging the countryside and pillaging cities in the heart of Italy. Recruit your armies amongst the enslaved warrior tribes of the Gauls, the Dacians, the Germans, the Syrians and the Thracians. Increase your forces tenfold as swiftly as possible before Rome sends its best legions to re-establish the Pax Romana.

Only your genius and your knowledge of war can save you and allow you to found a kingdom of former slaves. But be careful, for Roman strategists are watchful, and are taking the new menace more and more seriously. You must conquer or perish... on the cross !

Imperator: for the Romans the word signified a victorious general, and was an honorific title. The nearest term today is marshal, rather than emperor. Declaring Spartacus to be Imperator was an out and out provocation to Roman military nobility which sought honour above all !

As you are brave adventurers, you venture into the magic labyrinth to free the wizard  but you cannot do this without the help of its inhabitants. Visit the inhabitants and bring them certain items. You will receive coveted magic stones as a reward! The first player to fill his magic key with the magic stones and return to his starting field wins. But beware! Danger lurks everywhere...

In Das Elektronik Labyrinth, designer Reiner Knizia marries his facility for electronics in board games (e.g., Wer war's? and Die Insel) with Max J. Kobbert's long-running Labyrinth series of games from Ravensburger.

The basic game play is the same as in Labyrinth. The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.

After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.

In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.

The game comes with a book containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.

1812 is a member of the 18xx series of games. The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham. 1812 is set in 
North-East England in the 19th century. Two to four players represent investors in railway companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned Private and Minor Companies and later buying shares in Public Companies. The Public Companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its Director). Minor Companies and Public Companies build track and run Trains in order to earn revenues. Public Company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and Trains. A feature of 1812, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a Public Companys Director and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.

1812 is a medium length game. Experienced, brisk players can expect to take about three hours to complete a game.

Novices or more deliberate players might add a few hours to that time.

To produce energy, players draw resource cards from the table to their hand, and play sets of a resource type onto the table as production. The shared deck includes a fixed amount of five types of resources, which are from the most common to the rarest: coal, oil, natural gas, wood and uranium.

The game lasts three rounds and at the end of each round, players check their production. The more cards you have played on the table, the more you produce. If your company cannot produce enough energy for the market, it will be fined for not upholding its end of the contract. In addition, after comparing the production of all players, whoever has used the most of each resource type is fined for pollution. To make things interesting, you have the option of turning your production cards face down, so that they won't be counted as pollution. Though this action requires valuable turns to accomplish, all of the companies might use plenty of effort to mitigate their pollution!

At the end of the game, the player who produces the most energy, while dodging production fines through clever card play, wins.

RED WHITE  BLUE RACIN' sports simulation board game offers a unique way of re-creating a pro stock car race. Instead of tediously checking every car, every lap, the game uses a highlight reel method of generating exciting race action. You get right to good stuff! NO math exercises or constant index calculations and re-calculations--this game is NOT about crunching numbers. It's about high-octane thrills and super-charged race day drama! The result? A full race in as little as 45 minutes, packed with everything fans love about big-time pro stock car racing!

RED WHITE  BLUE RACIN' offers an assortment of different stock car experiences. The game comes with an all star set of driver cards representing stars of the past decade. For an additional charge, you can purchase a set of cards based specifically on last year's racing season, including everyone from the champion in the point standings to the drivers who ran only a race or two, and track cards for every racing venue at which a points race was held. There's also a Stars of the 1980s card set, allowing you to revive memories of racing's exciting past. Or create your OWN pro racing universe with a card set from our fictional pro stock car circuit, Stock Car Racing America--or SCRAM for short!

RWB Racin' allows you to play through a race, including qualifying, with the use of 6 dice and a game chart.  Each turn a section of drivers, top, middle or bottom will be highlighted and drivers from the group will get a chance to move up in the race or maybe even take the lead!  But along with the excitment of the race comes trouble which can lead to a trip to the pits or even taking a driver out of the race.

Utilizing a simple yet elegant system, each driver is rating on gas (passing), brake (defending against getting passed) as well as 6 racing skills.  Also represented is how good a driver is at qualifying as well as how good the pit crew is at fixing the damage along the way.  It is a quick system to learn, but you will be amazed at how it captures the essence of stock car racing.

There are two opposing players: Roman and Barbarian. The Roman player represents the high command of a centralized empire; the Barbarian player represents the various chaotic forces working to destroy that empire. The Roman objective is to reconsolidate the threatened empire and secure its frontier regions to prevent further barbarian invasion. The Barbarian objective is to grab as much Roman territory as possible. The game system is based on the one originally presented in our earlier ST games: They Died With Their Boots On, Vol. 1 and They Died With Their Boots On, Vol. 2.

The Barbarian side is divided into forces, each representing an independent people or coalition of tribes, such as the Goths. The Persians and Armenians, though commanded in the game by the barbarian player, are considered civilized forces (along with all Roman and rebel units).

Each turn represents one year. Each hexagon on the map represents 100 miles (162 km) from side to opposite side. Each unit represents 10,000 to 30,000 troops and camp followers, etc. Special rules cover such things as: usurpation, stratagems, random events, reinforcements, pursuit, taxation, Caesar and Augustus units, naval movement, fortresses and bases, fog of war, the Huns, political crises, tribal homelands, militia, field armies, supply trains, pursuit combat, amphibious operations, pillage, civic works, and more.

171779,GemPacked Cards,2015,7.3746,63,1.375,2,5,20,20,Family,Abstract Strategy Card Game ,Pattern BuildingSet Collection,"GemPacked Cards is a gem-crafting, color-blending card game for 2-5 players based on the GemPacked iOS puzzle game. During each round, players use the Gemino Pip Tokens they draw to try to acquire higher level Gemino Squares and Gemino Diamonds (worth victory points) or trade for Sun or Nova cards. All cards are played face up. When the last Gemino Pip Tokens are drawn from the starting pile, each player has one remaining turn before the round ends and players tally their score.

In more detail, at the start of a turn, a player draws two Gemino Pip Tokens, then takes any of the following actions in any order and as many times as they like:


    Trade GPips for GSquares on the card grid (placing pips in the common pool)
    Trade GSquares for GDiamond on the card grid (placing cards in the discard pile)
    Discard GSquares for GPip equivalents from the common pool (placing discards in the discard pile)
    Trade GPips for the Sun card or GSquares for the Nova card


At the end of their turn, the player refills the card grid from the draw deck one at a time. If they reveal any Action Cards, those cards are resolved immediately, starting with the active player, then moving clockwise around the table.

After the last Gemino Pip Token is drawn and the final player has a turn, players score their hands as well as Sun/Nova points. (GPips are not worth any points, but should be tracked each round as a tie breaker.) Whoever has the most points wins.

66896,American Carrom,1892,6.36796,103,1.25,2,4,60,60,,Action / Dexterity ,,"American Carrom, attributed to American Sunday school teacher Henry Haskell, is a derivative of Carrom.  American Carrom differs from Carrom in the board construction, particularly the larger size of the pockets and the striker (shooter) being the same size as the other pieces. American Carrom can also be played with a cue, and the board is patterned with checkers, chess or other board motifs, allowing a variety of other games to be played.  Many American Carrom boards also double as Crokinole boards.

In American Carrom the object is to flick to strike the Carrom men into the pockets in a similar fashion to pool or billiards.  Sometimes a cue is used rather than flicking.  Due to the larger pocket size American Carrom lacks some of the strategy and skill required of the 'proper' version of the game.

Also noteworthy is the fact that American Carrom uses rings for game pieces whereas Carrom game pieces are solid discs.

525,Pisa,1999,6.29078,103,1.75,3,5,45,45,,Card Game ,Trick-taking,"from Schloesser session report:

This is a  trick-taking game, but with enough twists to give it a very different feel. Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:

a) trump colors (primary  secondary) 
b) most or fewest tricks 
c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'

Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.

After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase. A number of rounds equal to the number of players is played, with the player accumulating the greatest number of victory points being the victor.

The game takes place relatively soon after Smaug attacked and drove out the Dwarves in Third Age 2770.

Thus adventurers can enter (and hopefully leave) in a variety of ways. A such as the one this game depicts could have been the event that caused Smaug to close all the minor entrances and to gather most of Erebors loot into one huge pile.

31803,Wadi,2007,6.18786,140,2.3478,2,4,30,30,,Ancient Territory Building ,Area Control / Area InfluenceModular Board,"Wadi is situated in the heat and drought of the ancient Egypt desert. Water is scarce and you try to build your Shadoof (a sort of waterpump) as close to the Wadi as possible. A wadi, however, is a desert river. Water flows though it for only a small part of the year. The rest of the time it is dry. In the short wet period, you try to pump as much water as possible to the water reservoirs. Preferably in the vicinity of fertile land, because the more fertile the land, the better the harvest. And the better the harvest, the more points a player earns.

But... other players might have noticed the same good spot, where you want to build your shadoof. And when you build your shadoof there, they wont help you fill the water reservoirs. But if you hesitate too long, the other players might pump dry the Wadi. Or worse, the water streams down the wadi and the land close to your shadoof remain dry and barren.

There are a few scenarios for Wadi delivered with the game. They bring a lot of variety.

Gameplay:
Players build their shadoofs on the land tiles. Each shadoof can pump water pawns from the river bed or from another land tile that lies in the vicinity of that shadoof (vicinity = water pawn lies on his own tile or on an adjacent tile). In his turn a player can carry out two actions. He can either:
 Build 1 shadoof first and then pump 1 water pawn (or vice versa)
OR
 Pump 2 water pawns.

Round after round players build shadoofs and/or pump water pawns. At the end of each round, the water that is still in the river bed, flows downstream. This means, that all the water pawns in the river beds are moved downstream 1 river tile.
When the river bed is completely empty, the game is over.

Players earn points per shadoof. Every landtile surrounding the shadoof (including its own tile) with a water pawn on it brings 1, 2 or 3 points, depending on the fertility of the land. The player with the highest score wins.

Players fight to get water pawns near their shadoofs and for the places to build their shadoofs. They also try to profit from water pawns that other players pumped on to the land tiles. Because of the placing rules (not explained here) this is not always as easy as it looks.

All in all Wadi is a quick, tactical game. With 2 players it is a bit more strategic.

173648,Booty,2015,7.27818,55,2.5,3,6,60,60,Family Strategy,Card Game Pirates ,,"Game description from the publisher:

Treasures of all types  yet the hard part is not capturing the ship's bounty, but dividing it fairly among the pirates! Players take turns splitting each round's booty into shares for the other players. Different types of treasures have different values, and of course there's the hidden items to keep people guessing. Will you be the quartermaster to give everyone their fair share  but giving yourself the best share?

Each round in Booty, cards representing treasures are revealed. Some are worth points immediately, some items cancel others, some give you a chance (but not a guarantee) for a big payday. The quartermaster, a job that travels from player to player, divides the treasures into shares and also includes the order of picking treasures in the next round. Balancing what you need, what others might want, and trying to get a little extra into your treasure pile is the key to success!

The building cards provide many special benefits that allow for a broad range of strategies every time you play.

After failing to defeat the invading Japanese forces on the beaches of Luzon, General MacArthur, commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), retreated the Philippine Army to the Bataan peninsula and Corregidor, according to War Plan Orange. Holding fortified positions and bolstered by the crack Philippine Scouts, the Allied forces would hold for months against the well equipped and trained Japanese invaders.

Bataan! is a two-player game, recreating the battle for the peninsula. Vance von Borries has drawn from his game design experience to create a game engine capable of portraying the tense jungle-fighting which took place on Bataan. While the system is based on a previous success, the changes needed to simulate the fighting on Bataan make this a unique gaming experience.

Japanese forces will move quickly to out-flank and pry the US/Filipino units from their fortifications. Yet the Americans can successfully launch attacks out of these strong points, particularly when the crack Philippine Scouts are in the lead. From time to time a player may lead with his armor and this was the one battle of the war where the lowly US Stuart tank was the superior tank!

A chit-pull system is used to randomly determine activations for the various formations on each side. In general, formation size is based on a division. Each formation activates individually for movement and combat. Players alternate activations based on the random chit-pull until all formations have played. Most Japanese formations receive two activations per turn, thereby demonstrating their combat capabilities, preparedness and motivation in taking an offensive role. Individual unit counters represent battalions or half battalions, and include efficiency ratings for combat comparisons and other functions.

Bataan! features five scenarios. The three early scenarios, which include a learning scenario, all play to a conclusion in one sitting. They feature a surprising amount of movement for a mostly jungle warfare game and rely on sound military tactics. Only the fourth scenario, the last battle, is a true set-piece action. The Japanese planned it that way and yet even the outcome of that battle was not pre-ordained. All scenarios are tied together by a campaign scenario where both players contend with supply and disease to field the best force possible for the final offensive.

Components:

     1 map  22 x 34 - [scale of 1.2 km to the hex]

(BGG user description:)

Bataan! is a two-player operational level game of this WW II Pacific theater campaign, January through April 1942. It presents a fascinating contest of two mismatched armies on a subject our hobby has not gamed often. The US/Filipino defense, embattled, isolated and led initially by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, for three months held off a numerically inferior but well-equipped and very aggressive Japanese force led by General Masaharu Homma. While the US and Filipino forces can be said to have won most of the first contests: the Abucay Line, the Battle of the Points and the Battle of the Pockets, it would be the final contest that decided the issue. Only because of continued complete isolation would the US lose that final battle in April 1942. And yet it was that heroic defense of sublime courage that helped motivate the US to endure the reverses of the war and persevere to a complete victory. It was Why We Fight.

After the enormous critical and sales success of Warriors of God, MMP is proud to present the grandfather of Warriors of God, Nakajimas masterpiece, Warriors of Japan.

Long considered one of the greatest games to ever be published in Japan, Warriors of Japan will feature much of the same system as we have seen in Warriors of God. The game covers the Nanboku-cho period of Japanese history and simulates one of the most dynamic and important periods in Japanese history.

From 1336-1392, all of Japan was aflame with war. After the fall of a corrupt and ineffective emperor, the two great courts of Japan dueled to determine the future ruler of the country. Warriors of Japan covers the vital period following the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate and the fight to find a successor.

Players of Warriors of God will find much familiar here, however, unlike the enormous time period covered in Warriors of God, Warriors of Japan covers only 4 years. Subtle changes in the system to cover this unique period have been exchanged in Warriors of Japan. For example, Leaders no longer die from old age but rather can switch sides unexpectedly during a combat. Subtle changes in the movement and combat rules will add to the strategy to a greater extent than in Warriors of God. A random game start generator will keep each game fresh and interesting. Warriors of Japan also brings us home to our wargaming roots. To learn and discover some new period of history that we didnt know about before in much the same way we discovered history through our wonderful hobby in our youth.

Join them in their exploration of the universe and their quest for victory. Players will explore, challenge each others, and engage in short-term or long-term alliances, but there will be battles and mighty spaceships involved. In Metal Adventures, you'll use cards to explore, enhance your ship and your crew, and live up to bold challenges. There will be negotiations, battle tactics, and the uncertainty and risk that really make a pirate's life.

During the game, each player uses a fancy four-wheeled astrolabe to track their power (which can be improved via equipment), damage (which reduces power), glory (which is how players win), and the judgement of pirates (which affects glory).

On a turn, a player either rests (gaining money and repairing their ship) or else travels (paying to do so), battles (either starships, planets or opponents), and optionally takes the tour of pirates, visiting one of the ten planets in the game and taken the action available there. Each player holds two trophy cards, and when they meet the conditions on one of them, they can reveal it to earn credits, glory or both. They can gain support (single-use cards) and equipment (providing power adjustments and possibly other special abilities), keeping at most four of these improvement cards at a time.

Players can negotiate alliances and trade anything but glory, and while they must keep their word for immediate exchanges and actions, they can break promises or alliances in later turns, although doing so requires them to suffer the judgement of pirates, thereby affecting their glory count. Collect four such points, and they can no longer ally with other players or give or receive assistance.

When a player has nine or more glory points or the space deck contains two or fewer cards, the game ends and whoever has the most glory wins.

1914, Serbien mu sterbien, The Initial Campaigns on the Balkan Front in WWI realistically covers the battles fought in and around Serbia during the first year of World War One.

1914, Serbien mu sterbien (an Austro-Hungarian jingle that translates to Serbia must die) is a comprehensively researched model that explores the intriguing set of campaigns fought in Serbia in 1914. The game includes an accurate order of battle and detailed game map. The map encompasses the primary theater of war from Peterwardein in the north, Sarajevo in the west, to Ni in the south-east.

The game system used is the same as found in 1914: Offensive à outrance (GMT). The game has a playtested, concise, well written and organized 24-page rules booklet. 
1914, Serbien mu sterbien includes three sceanrios. Two short scenarios and a Grand Campaign scenario that covers the period from the initial Austro-Hungarian invasion in August to exhaustion a stalemate in December.

The game-design goal for 1914, Serbien mu sterbien is to produce an enjoyable game from which players can learn a great deal about the campaign and the geography of the theater of war. The result is a game that the WW1 enthusiast must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.

Game Scale:
The combat units are primarily Divisions and Brigades. The maps scale is 1:500,000. Each hex is approximately 8 kilometers across, with the corresponding area being roughly 6475 hectares (or 16000 acres). Each game turn represents from two to four days of time depending on the season.

Group of Soviet Forces Germany features a simulation of a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Germany in the late 1970's. It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.

This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.

The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.

Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.

The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations. Others are also provided as informational markers and memory aids.

Players still try to collect as many points in all four symbol colours. Points are given when a player connects two or more towers with his tiles, with the larger towers also giving special points.

In a turn, a player places one of his two-hex tiles on an empty space on the board. He will try to connect two or more towers, as this brings him as many points for a colour as stated on the coloured chips on the tower. When scored, the chips are turned on their black side that has a different scoring. New chains will score better than enlarging an existing one as this will only score for the new connected tower. There are bonus fields which advance any one colour 1 space on the score track when a tile is placed over them. Connecting the large towers gives a bonus of one point in every colour for each large tower in the chain, which can be very rewarding.

The game ends after 20 rounds when all players have placed their tiles. Each player's weakest colour on his score track is his score, with the highest score being victorious.

The game is a two player strategic simulation of General Ulysses S. Grant's campaign of 29 April through 4 July 1863 that culminated in the capture of the capture of Vicksburg and the splitting of the Confederacy. The Union forces are powerful but initially weaker than the total rebel strength, yet forced to take the offensive. The two Confederate armies are widely separated at first, but can form a decisive mass if they can link up.

The game map depicts the theater of operations in the central Mississippi. It is divided into areas, stretching from Bruinsburg to Jackson. Each map area serves to regulate movement and combat and represents a fourteen mile square of terrain. The two campaign game scenarios cover the period between 29 April and 4 July 1863 using two day turns. A smaller scenario covers the key maneuvering and combat that took place at Champion Hill. Special rules cover the weather, Union gunboats and rebel shore batteries, the siege of Vicksburg, among other things.

Play your cards wisely to get rid of all the ghosts, undead, vampires, zombies and other spooky creatures haunting your mansion. Block your opponents while they're trying to drive spirits out of their home and into your backyard  but beware as the scariest ghosts will not be driven away so easily...

In game terms, your goal in Ghooost! is to get rid of all of your cards in hand and in your mansion by playing a card (or several matching cards) equal to or higher than the one(s) played previously. To set up, each player has four ghost cards in hand and 4-12 cards in his mansion. Ghost cards come in four suits and have values ranging from 1 to 14, with a few cards having special powers; scary (red) ghosts, for example, can be topped only by fearless ghosts, other scary ghosts, or a ghost quartet, while fearless ghosts can be played no matter what's on top of the Cemetery (discard pile).

A game consists of two stages. In the first stage, players draw or play cards to prepare their hand of cards for the second stage. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:


    Play one or more matching cards on the Cemetery equal to or higher than the cards played previously, then refill your hand to four cards by drawing from the Crypt (deck).
    Take all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand; any card can be played on an empty Cemetery.
    Draw one card from the Crypt and try to play it, taking all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand if the play isn't valid.


Once the Crypt is empty, the second stage begins and players take turns either playing valid cards into the Cemetery or taking all cards from the Cemetery into their hand. If a player plays two or three matching ghosts, he takes another turn immediately; if he plays four cards that match (or plays cards that complete a quartet), those cards and the Cemetery are removed from play, then he takes another turn. If a player's hand is empty, he draws the top card from his mansion, playing it if valid and taking all the Cemetery cards into his hand if not. If a player empties his hand and mansion, he's out and the others keep playing. Play continues until only one player has cards in hand; this player loses the game and everyone else wins.

Ghooost! includes a scoring system that allows for multiple rounds.

This card game starts with the same premise as the well-known 6 nimmt!: Each turn, players all simultaneously reveal one card from their hand, then these cards are placed into existing rows one at a time, starting with the lowest-valued card. If a row is full, then whoever played that final card takes all of the cards already in the row, scoring negative points for all of the bullheads on those cards.

X nimmt! changes these rules a few ways. Each player starts with eight cards in hand and a personal X row. Played cards will be placed into three rows, with those rows being able to hold three, four or five cards. Whenever someone takes cards from a row, those cards go into the player's hand, then the player must play one card into their personal X row.

All cards in this X row must also be played in ascending order! If you can't do this, then you place all of those X cards aside in order to start a new X row, with the value of those set-aside cards now being doubled.

A round ends after someone plays the final card in their hand, and whoever has the fewest negative points after two rounds wins.

Each round, the active player reveals an ice floe card from the deck, then places one or more penguins of the same color (plus jokers) on the table to bid for the card. Other players can increase the bid using the same color or pass. Once everyone but one person drops out, that player discards his bid and collects the ice floe. All other players have the option of discarding their penguins or keeping them in a face-down pile. Players then draw 0, 1 or 2 cards to refill their hands based on the number of cards they played: 0, 1 or 2+.

When the game-ending floe is revealed, the game ends and players discard their hands. Players then compare their ice floe total with their penguin points (the cards collected face-down). If the totals match, the player's score is the sum of penguin points. If the player has more floe points, he subtracts the difference from his penguin score; if he has more penguins than floe, he subtracts twice the difference from his penguin score. High score wins, with the number of floe cards in hand breaking ties.

I hope you remember the great movie Inception. Cobb and his team of Extractors are offered a job to implant an idea into a persons mind by infiltrating his dreams. The target is Fischer and the client is Saito, who will profit greatly from Fischer's new idea. The reward: a lot of money and the chance for Cobb to return home to see his children. But to plant a thought deep enough into someones mind, youll have to go very deep. A dream within a dream within another dream. And if you die in a dream, youll end up in Limbo and probably go mad.

Guide Cobb and his team through the different dream levels. Recruit your team members and sedate Fischer in the waking reality. Step deeper into his dreams, plant Inceptions, and prepare for the final Kick thatll bring the team back home. Fight against attackers, Cobb's adversaries and Fischers dream police. Cobbs wife Mal will show up and try to stop the team. And some of your team might end up in Limbo and have to be saved first before they can return to reality.

About the gameplay:

Inception is a solo (1-player) card game with a playing time of around 50 to 60 minutes.

Each turn the player draws 2 cards to his hand. Some negative cards (Cobbs Flashbacks) apply immediately, while the others may be played in the Play cards step. Cards may be played in different ways. They may be discarded to use their one-shop effects. Weapon cards may be attached to a character to increase his strength against attacks. Other cards may be placed in a dedicated Convince Display from which they may be played when trying to convince opponents or to plant Inceptions. But the player should also keep some cards in his hand, to either react to new Events or boost his strength when defending against an attacker. These are the tactical choices that have to be made and that will determine success or failure.

An Event card is drawn from the Dream Level the Characters are currently in. You will have to evade attacks, convince people, plant Inceptions in Fischers mind, and face other challenges. Team members might die, as in the movie, and have to be found in Limbo and convinced to come back with you.

To win the game, the final Inception on Fischer has to be successful, Mal must be dead, and Saito, Cobb, and enough members for the final Kick must still be alive.

If the Customs Agent does not believe the player, they may search the player's luggage (cards are revealed) with two results.  If the player declared accurately, the Customs Agent must pay the player 200 for defamation of character.  If the player declared incorrectly, he must pay the Customs Agent fines for all items in his luggage.

35306,Battlefields of Olympus,2008,6.19771,131,1.9524,2,2,30,30,Strategy,Ancient Card Game Mythology Wargame ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenHand ManagementRock-Paper-Scissors,"Battlefields of Olympus is a quick turn based strategy game with some hand management. The numerous tactical choices, combined with a limited military force and the unexpected appearance of Ares on the battlefield, give the game its strategic component. The relatively simple game mechanics make it easy to learn and play, even if you aren't a tactical genius.

Backstory
In the kingdom of immortals, the restless gods decree that mortal man will fight one another to prove their loyalty. By order of Zeus, The war god Ares leaves his throne to inform man of this noble contest. To the victors go the spoils of war and eternal gratitude from the gods.

As the general of battle hardened archers, infantry, and other units, you have been commissioned by the high priests to lead your people to victory. When the sisters of fate look favorably upon you, your armies will find strategic advantage on the battlefield. Ambush, flank and surround your opponent's forces in an effort to gain the upper hand.  If the battle looks bleak, call on your mercenary forces to turn the tide.

Game Overview
The idea behind Battlefields of Olympus is to secure a number of Land Trophy cards through battle using Warrior cards and Action cards. The one with the most valuable lands by the end of the game is victor. Battlefields of Olympus is a tug of war, where each player must decide when to use his forces to fight and when it is better to retreat and gather strength for later battles.

There is also an element of press your luck as the appearance of Ares and the order that land turns up during the game is randomly predetermined. On the other hand, when there is a stack of face-up Land Trophy cards, strategic planning is paramount, as players must decide when it is better to concede a battle in favor of a more valuable Land Trophy card farther down in the stack.

Each player commands a legion of up to 4 Warrior cards, but there is often a reserve pile of Warrior cards to draw from at the end of battle. Players need to decide when it is better to keep more powerful Warriors in hand and when it is better to retire the weaker ones from their reserve pile. The limit of 4 Action cards in hand forces players to manage what actions they need most.

The optional fortify and sacrifice rules create more tension as players have additional tough decisions to make. Using the Fortify action will protect your land, but at the risk of temporarily weakening the size of your military force in hand. Do you sacrifice a piece of hard-fought land in favor of your opponent's more valuable property, or do you wait until a valuable Land Trophy card turns up on the land pile.

Fortunately, there are many mirrors that can be used to find these things without him having to move in all there rooms.

The game box with a coverage forms the castle. On each side, there are three windows. On stays open, the others are filled with images of the items to find - but visible only from the inside of the box. There are also 4 mirrors which can be stuck into the box (at 45 degree angles), which make it possible to see any of the items when looking through the one open window into the castle. There's also a door (used with the advanced rules) that can block the view.

Players in turn roll a die, and move Victor along a track at the top of the box. The space he's landing on show what item he now has to find. He may move up to 3 mirrors, then peek through the open window. If the wrong item shows up, it's the next players turn. But when the correct item is seen, he gains one blood token; afterward, that item and the open window switch places.

The other players may gain a blood token, too. After the active player has set up the mirrors, but before he looks to the window, they may predict whether the correct item shows up. If the guess right, the gain a drop.

The player that first a set number of blood tokens (depending on number of players) wins the game.

Players will be controlling a mining company working in harsh conditions to acquire the most credits.

GENERAL INFO: A euro game for 1-5 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes.

THEME: Science Fiction. Space is a hostile environment with a known alien presence. Resources are scarce and it is commonplace for companies to mine asteroids to acquire them. It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich!

HOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting.

WINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid.

MECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of Power Dice, these are community dice that players will use in order to successfully mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid.

After all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Power Die is rolled. A player starts his/her turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully.

Throughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks.

When 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game.

Darkrock Ventures will also include special 2-player game rules, as well as a Solo/Co-Operative variant.

36616,Qyshinsu: Mystery of the Way,2008,6.83143,70,3,2,2,15,15,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,,"BOARD: there are twelve triangles on the surface of the circular board. Only one stone may reside on a space.

STONES: There are a total of 24 stones (12 red  12 black). Each player chooses one color, red or black. There is one pair of six different kinds of stones for a total of 12 stones per player. They vary in kind:


     Stone of 1
     Stone of 2
     Stone of 3
     Stone of 4
     Stone of 5
     Old Stone


MOVEMENT: There are only two actions a player can perform - placing or removing a stone from the board.

RULES: When you place a stone in a space on the board, your opponent must place or remove one of their stones (# of spaces - according to the value of the stone you placed) away from your stone in either direction on the board - to the right or left of your stone. The same rule applies when removing a stone - the logic is the same.

The Old Stone is unique. When placing this stone, your opponent MUST place a stone in the nearest vacant space to it. When removing this stone, your opponent MUST remove their nearest stone to it.

ADDITIONAL RULES (The Precepts):


     First Precept: players are not allowed to touch each others stones.
     Second Precept: only two of each kind of stone is allowed on the board at the same time.
     Third Precept: when you remove a stone from a space, that same kind of stone may not be put back in that same space on your very next turn.


OBJECTIVE: Return to the Way:

This occurs when your opponent is unable to place or remove a stone.

Diam is a game of strategy for 2, 3, or 4 players.  The simplicity of the rules and the depth of play will satisfy players of all strengths and all ages.

The goal of the game: to place 2 pawns of identical color at the same height on 2 diametrically opposed spaces.

The objective is very clear, and you constantly feel you're close to winning.  Victory is within your grasp!

But beware, this simplicity is misleading.  With each move, your opponent can discern your intentions and launch a counter-attack!  You'll need solid nerves.  Stay focused, anticipate, move your colors with accuracy and you will become the master of Diam!

How to play?

In the beginning, each player has a reserve of 8 pawns: 4 red pawns and 4 orange pawns for player 1: 4 maroon pawns and 4 black pawns for player 2.

In a turn, each player can:

     either place a pawn from the player's reserve onto an empty space or onto a pawn already on the board,
     or move one of the player's pawns already placed on the board to an adjacent space.




With 3 players:
This alternative is played has 2 against 1.  The basic rules are identical to the rules for 4 players; the player who is alone having 2 colors, however.

With 4 players:
This alternative is played by teams of 2.  Each player has his own color and the players play in turn.

The basic rules are identical to the rules for 2 players, the following constraint is added:

     a player cannot place a pawn from his partner's reserve.
     a player can, on the other hand, move his pawns or his partner's pawns already on the board.

You will take on the role of a hero set out to recover treasure, slay monsters, and find a place for yourself in the retelling of Greek myths. The game is played with a set of (initially) 30 cards that represent the monsters, treasures, and gods will become the tale of your adventure. This deck, and your character, will change and grow as you play more games, which is meant to reflect how tales become more embellished and outlandish each time they are told.

Each turn you flip over the top three cards of the adventure deck. These cards represent monsters, treasures, and the favors of the gods. You must then allocate your crew members to each of the cards. After all of your crew have their tasks, you roll against each card. The more crew members you have on a card, the likelier you are to resolve it positively. Monsters are defeated and treasures are won. Fail the roll and treasures will be lost to you, and monsters will send your crew members to Hades. As you are among the crew, once they have all died you will also be on your way to meet Charon.

Once the deck has been exhausted, the adventure is complete and you have won! The game is not over however. After each successful retelling of your adventures, the story grows! Much like tales become taller every time they are told, the adventure deck will become more legendary each time you win.

All of the cards in the game will have check boxes on them that will be used to represent the level of the card. Cards that were defeated or captured after a successful adventure will be marked: monsters will become stronger and treasures will lose durability. Some monsters will even bring reinforcements into your deck.

Additionally, so that the player may keep up, the player can also level up after successful adventures. This allows the player to start games with a larger crew and add new items to the deck.

The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.

Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.

History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, A very near run thing, that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.

Borodino was fought between the Army of Imperial Russia and Napoleon's Grand Armee on September 7 1812. The battle ended with a French victory, but strategic defeat. Losses were terrible on both sides, but the Russians could replace theirs. One week after the battle Napoleon occupied an undefended Moscow, hoping to impose a peace, but after four weeks was forced to retreat home with calamitous results.

The historical battle involved wave after wave of frontal attacks by both sides, focusing on the Russian redoubts. However, the game will show all the options available to Napoleon and Kutuzov, including some not attempted historically. The French player has several possible lines of attack and the Russian player must try to anticipate and counter them all. The tactical interaction of Napoleonic infantry, cavalry and artillery is also emphasized, including cavalry charges and squares. This makes for exciting and tense gaming.

Movement and combat are resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Shiloh. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division of the same corps. Game time is 3-4 hours.

This game is scheduled to be released September 7, 2012.

Note:  This game should not be confused with Borodino 1812 or Borodino 1812 or any other similarly-named games.

But the place is already occupied by lost souls which have been in confrontation for ages. The Standish cannot escape from this haunted house and will be the collateral damage of the conflict.

In Phantom, the four areas of the house  Garden, Basement, Ground Floor and First Floor  are placed in a line, with the areas divided into two sides. Each player controls Ghosts in half of the house, and he must make Spectres, Souls and other Spirits appear in front of the different areas of the house in order to frighten the Occupants before the other player. Each turn, a player can play a card  Ghost or Place  in order to increase the Scare level of his corresponding apparition; each Place card must be played in front of its corresponding area(s); for example, the Attic must be played in the First Floor,while  the Stairs can be played either in the First Floor or in the Ground Floor. (Note: In Europe, the first floor is customarily the initial floor above ground level, while in the U.S. the floor at ground level is the first floor.)

The Ghost cards can be played in front of any areas. Each of them creates a special effect:


    The Squatter takes a Place from the opponent's apparition.
    The Charmer makes an Occupant come in the area.
    The Howler puts Occupants off the area.
    The Knocker discards a Ghost from the opponent's apparition.
    The Queen takes a Ghost of his family from the opponent's apparitions.
    The Invoker gets a Ghost back from the discard pile.


Unfortunately for you, the adults of the family can kill off some vulnerable Ghosts, and a family of Ghosts is vulnerable to each of the adults. Some Places protect the Ghosts from the adults.

At the end of a player's turn, the Scare level of the apparitions in the different areas are compared to the Fear threshold of any Occupants located there. When a player's Scare level is higher or equal to the Fear threshold of an Occupant who is alone in the corresponding area, this player takes this Occupant and wins the corresponding Victory points. After his turn, the player draws Ghost/Place cards until he has five cards in hand.

Each adult is worth 3 victory points (VPs), each child 2 VPs, the baby 4 VPs, and the Priest adds 1 VP to the last Occupant of the house. As soon as a player has collected 11 VPs, the game ends, with him as the winner.

In this game, a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. A card shows a combination of two different colors/symbols familiar to those who know the Ingenious board game.

On a turn, the active player plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points  thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.

As in Ingenious, players take an extra turn immediately if they max out the points available in a color, with ten being the highest number in Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel.

Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.

Players assume command of either army and take turns to execute their orders for their forces.

In this game, units exert a zone of control around them, forcing opposing units to maneuver around them to avoid being stopped in their tracks.  Engagements between units are resolved by consulting results of dice rolls modified by terrain, leadership, and other factors against charts.  Airborne assaults and air support are also part and parcel of the combat.  Keeping units in reserve is a strategical option, allowing players to immediately exploit breakthroughs and redeploy after battles.

The game ends after a certain number of rounds.  The players total up their victory points (typically for occupying strategic locations with their units) and whoever has more is the winner.

The Old Gods have deserted the world.

A new dark pantheon of Gods watches over the earth and feeds upon the spoils of war; a banquet of souls slain on the wretched battlefields of Chronopia.
  
Since the Day of Dread nothing has been the same, the past is now but a forgotten dream. Storm clouds mass on all horizons, dark and brooding, shot with blood red, as the tides of war thunder back and forth across a blistered and broken land.
 One man took it upon himself to save his people in a breathtaking and desperate quest. To conquer the time-streams and be reborn. To battle with evil when it finally manifests itself upon the world.

High in the Eternal Tower of Chronopia, the One King sits alone, his mind studying the great and expansive time streams, with their countless possibilities. Looking into futures and pasts, he tries to determine a path among the

myriad possibilities that spring from every point in time.
  
Visions wracked the One King, nightmares born of doubt. Had his actions brought about the terrible events he sought to avoid? What subtleties and nuances must be brought to bear to fashion a future free of this Dark Prophecy?

Once you have chosen your army it will be time to select the troops that you will lead into battle.  Chronopia isn't a game that relies on the strengths of only one model, but rather the abilities of a diverse collection of warriors all working towards a common goal.  You will populate your army with warbands of close combat warriors, soldiers trained in all manner of weaponry from swords to axes; missile weapon warbands that will rain death down upon their enemies in great volleys; and Individuals like spell casters or fearsome monsters or even mighty war chariots.  Whatever the case, you will create a diverse army with which to recreate the epic struggles of the Empires of the Fourth Age of Chronopia.  You will populate your forces with miniatures and models available from Excelsior Entertainment.  
These models will represent your own style of waging war and will be selected for your tastes.  Once you have chosen your warriors you will need to paint them.  A well-painted army will bring your games to life and seize your imagination with the epic battles you will recreate.  There are many resources to help you learn how to paint your miniatures and we recommend that you practice and try new techniques- the results will well be worth it.

You will need a few things to begin your epic journey into the realms of Chronopia.  Most important are this rule book, some Chronopia miniatures from the extensive Chronopia line, Warband Unit Cards (which come with each model), a twenty-sided die (d20), a ruler or measuring tape, and a pen.  In addition to these items you may need some of the counters and templates found in the back of this book.  You will also need a place to engage your armies in battle.  This can be an inspiring custom war game table that you have spent a great amount of time creating or it can be as simple as a dining room table or a stretch of floor.  The site of a well-designed table however, with your armies spread out before you will do wonders to fire the imaginations and invigorate your play.  There are numerous resources for how to create battlefields and just as many manufactured resources to draw upon.  Excelsior also makes a line of battlefield accessories that can be used in your game

Jacob Marley is alive and well. And whats more, hes the boss of you.

Youre a lowly clerk in young Jacob Marleys powerful investment firm, which lends money to needs people throughout the city of London. Marley has decided to elevate one lucky clerk to the status of friend, meaning a partnership in Marleys business, a handsome promotion, and Marleys lifetime friendship. Hell even get you out of Hell if you manage to outlive him. Such a deal!

To make the most points with the boss, you must lend his money to the most trustworthy clients, and stay away from the ones that will ruin you. If youre lucky, youll even grow up to be as stingy and horrible as he is.

Jacob Marley, Esquire is a banking game with all the fun and excitement that implies. No, seriously, its good.

As a clerk in Marleys investment firm, you are given an account of 12 to lend to various neer-do-well clients in London. Each turn, you move Marley through the streets of the city, randomly affecting the economy of London with a cool Economy Chart. Then you can see whats going on in the street where Marley stopped. Will you lend your money to a lawyer, a financial institution, or a petty criminal? The choice is yours, but make sure youre not the only player with a client like this, or it can cost you a bundle of money and points!

The version which was subsequently published is significantly different, and (claims Cheapass, with some justification) much improved.

Adventure Time Card Wars: Princess Bubblegum vs. Lumpy Space Princess is another standalone two-player game that continues the Adventure Time Card Wars series. This time, Princess Bubblegum and her NiceLands deck take on Lumpy Space Princesss totally rad dual-Landscape deck in a royal rumble.

NiceLands Creatures are all about using the damage on them to make them better. Most Creatures are looking for a particular sweet spot of damage. Sometimes you will want to heal damage from your Creatures to get them there. But sometimes you might actually damage your own Creatures to get them to that sweet spot. This new deck not only brings a new Landscape to the mix, but a whole new style of play.

Lumpy Space Princesss deck is a Useless Swamps and Blue Plains deck. This is the first time a Collectors Pack has featured something other than a mono-color deck. The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around discarding cards to power up your Creature abilities. Which is never a bad thing for the swampy side, as they thrive when they have built up a sizable discard pile.

The Blue Plains side of the deck is themed around replacing Creatures you control. Many of the Creatures in this half of the deck get killer bonuses for replacing Creatures that were already in play. It complements the Useless Swamp desire for a large discard pile as well. Such synergy!

Many become disillusioned, discontent even, and turn to pirating the prosperous trade routes between the five planets, much to the regret of the colonies' leaders, who have great need of the trade income in order to advance technologies and create jobs for the newly-arrived colonists.

Colonies is a game of resource management in the far reaches of space in which the players compete to dominate in trade, politics and technological development. Each player controls the administration of a planet with access to a unique resource. In order to win you need to collect the most colonial credits by trading resources, upgrading your technologies, keeping your trade lanes free of pirates, and perhaps pushing the council's decisions in the right direction.

At the begining of each turn, players receive an income of their own resource. The council meets each turn to vote on how to handle an occurring event. The outcome can reward those willing to put in an effort or punish those who are not. Players may do well to form alliances in order to sway the vote in a favourable direction.

The resource income and the colonists that arrive each turn  sometimes in large numbers, sometimes in small  are used to make advances in five areas: Community, Military, Commerce, Influence and Industry. Following the council's vote, players take turns to either upgrade these areas or activate one of them to grant asylum to pirates in exchange for resources or hunt them for bounty, sell resources for Credits, make trade agreements more beneficial, or produce additional resources. When everyone has had three such actions, the players receive and pay resources according to the trade agreements, and any colonists that players have failed to employ turn to piracy, preventing players from getting income from their trade agreements next turn unless preemptive action is taken.

Colonies lasts ten turns, with players earning victory points (VPs) from colonial Credits and technology advances. In the end, the player with the most VPs wins.

Expedition Sumatra leads the players into the dense primeval forest of the Indonesian island. By cleverly flipping and rotating the path tiles they have to build new roads through the jungle, track down rare animals and load them onto their ships, which circle around the island.

Like the vegetation in a jungle the board of Expedition Sumatra is constantly changing its appearance - old paths vanish, new ones appear, while the players are searching for animals hidden in the forest.

At the start of the game, each player receives a sheet of paper on which she will write definitions of created words and vote on which definitions among all the players she thinks are best.

In a round, the active player rolls all ten dice  seven of which have consonants on all sides, and three of which have only vowels  then creates a word by using at least three dice. (This word cannot be real, and if anyone claims it is, reroll the dice and try again.) Each player writes a definition for this new word, then places her sheet of paper in the center of the table. The active player shuffles these papers, then hands one to each person; the active player then reads off the definition, followed by the other players in clockwise order. A player might end up reading her own definition.

As a reminder of the definitions, each player then gives a short keyword or key phrase for the definition she read. Players will then each distribute three tokens to the answers they thought best, with one of those tokens going to the player's own answer. (This self-congratulatory vote aids in the scorekeeping process.)

After each person has been the active player once, the game ends and the player with the most tokens is crowned Queen Frigiti!

Each player controls different armies consisting of footmen, cavalry, elephants and galleys, each of which has different movement rules. In combat, each player plays two cards from his hand, with cards coming from a standard 52-card deck. Different units have different powers; the elephant, for example, doubles a player's highest card while the cavalry doubles his lowest one. Certain combinations of cards allow for special actions, such as seeing what your opponent plays before laying down your own cards.

With a seeming fascination for all things Scottish, Idi Amin referred to himself as the uncrowned king of Scotland. When Amin fled Uganda in a sense he truly became The Last King of Scotland.

Shibumi is the essence of beauty, or elegance in its minimal form. A shibumi object may appear simple but will reward the viewer with hidden depths as it is explored over time. Shibumi is simplicity hiding complexity.

COMPONENTS

The Shibumi set is not a single game but many games; it is the simplest of game systems. The set includes a square board with 4x4 holes and 48 white, black and red balls (16 each).

Balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls. Conversely, if a ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. If a ball is not pinned then its free.

EDITIONS

Published by nestorgames, it is presented in 3 editions:

- Ninja: Small, light, portable. It includes a black and small cotton bag, a blue foam board, 19mm plastic balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games.

- Samurai: Big, solid, strong. It includes a big white bag, a laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic board and 25mm phenolic resin balls (same material as snooker balls) in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games. Optionaly 3 bowls for the marbles can be purchased.

- Shogun: The executive edition for the big boss. It includes a big laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic box with 4x4 holes on its lid, a big white bag, 25mm phenolic resine balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a pendrive with rules for many games. You will be able download future games and computer versions into your pendrive as they become available.

The phenolic balls are absolutely exquisite as they are:

- Light: around 15 grams each.
- Round: each ball is perfectly spherical without blemish; they stack and drop correctly every time.
- Warm: both in temperature and in the nice snooker ball clack they make when struck together.
- Tough: they won't chip or crack and seem pretty much indestructible.

They look and feel fantastic. When you pick them up you just want to keep fondling them.

HISTORY

Games and puzzles based on square pyramidal stackings have existed at least since Edouard Lucas' cannon-ball stacking problem of 1875. The most famous 4x4 square pyramidal game is Pylos (published by Gigamic). Shibumi is different due to the third ball colour, drop mechanism, different numbers of players, lack of a board gutter, and the fact that it's a system for playing many games rather than the embodiment of a single game. Some Shibumi games may be playable with a Pylos set but many will not.

Shibumi game system concept by Cameron Browne 2011.

577,Parts Unknown,1999,5.93439,221,1.9048,4,10,90,90,Strategy Thematic,Economic Horror ,Commodity SpeculationRoll / Spin and Move,"Players are retail store owners who supply body parts to the local mad scientists. Viktor, a mad scientist, goes around window shopping. Whenever he stops to look at a particular type of parts, a demand for that type of part is created; all the parts at the cheapest price get sold. If there is still a demand, all the parts at the next cheapest price get sold. This continues until demand is met. If parts sold exceed demand, a surplus is created, which may put an extra townsfolk back into the population. If the demand is not met, a shortage is created which will be filled by removing a townsfolk.

Each turn, players get a part from their gravediggers, and can pay for more parts. Players can buy store shelves, and stock those shelves with parts, setting them to a specific, fixed price. If parts don't sell. the may be shuffled off to the parts unknown pile, which will automatically sell at certain times at a highly discounted rate. There could be, at times, a monster on the loose which scares off shoppers, getting them to buy parts only at the cheapest price, ignoring other available parts. Also, villagers might riot, which causes parts from the gravediggers to be more expensive. Player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

On The Cards comprises a deck of 50 or so rule cards that define how cards move from the (shared) deck, through players' hands and into tricks, and how cards are scored at the end of the round. By combining these rule cards, you can create thousands of games!

The Fixed Rule cards (black) are always used. In each round, the rules on the Fixed Rule cards are combined with the rules on one card of each other type: Deal, Aim, Card Play and Trick Taking.


    Deal (red) defines how the dealer will distribute cards.



    Aim (yellow) defines the objective of the round and how it will be scored.



    Card Play (green) defines how the players will play cards.



    Trick Taking (blue) defines how tricks will be won.


In later games you can add Optional Twist cards (mauve) and Double cards to spice things up.

Players conduct an experiment each turn by rolling 3 dice, hoping for each die to be at least as high as the shared Fortune Die. Each success lets the alchemist draw a new card from the deck or play a card from hand; each failure means a discard.

Cards represent Innovations to improve the alchemist's laboratory, Misfortunes to make rivals' lives harder, Actions to immediately impact the game, and Reactions to respond to other alchemists' deeds.

When an alchemist rolls doubles in an experiment, Chaos occurs and fortunes change. The experimenter re-rolls the Fortune Die, making success easier or harder to achieve.

Players race to build up a laboratory sophisticated enough to turn lead into gold. The first player with 10 or more points of Innovations in the laboratory is the victor!

Rule clarification: A standard experiment involves rolling 3 dice (this is unclear in the Second Edition rulebook).

193238,Tunisia II,2016,8.73333,30,4.5,1,2,0,0,,Wargame World War II ,Dice RollingHex-and-CounterSimulation,"Tunisia II is an Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing covering the campaign in Northwest Africa from November 1942 through May 1943.

This new edition is similar to the original 1995 Tunisia game from The Gamer's, but features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and new maps. The tempo of play is just outstanding, beginning with just a few units in play. Over the next few months both sides rapidly reinforce the theater. The build-up culminates with Rommels offensive at Kasserine and tension over the variable entry of Montgomerys 8th Army. This climax is followed by the slow destruction of Axis forces in North Africa.

The upgrade of this game involved a handful of important decisions. A straight reprint was out of the question, since the original was designed back when the OCS v2 rulebook was fairly new. In Tunisia II we standardize how the game should be played with the latest series rules, and also have updated it to fit better with newer OCS games. So units and rules have been changed to conform to games also set in 1942-43: DAK II, Case Blue, and Sicily II. Recent work on Beyond the Rhine is also factored in.

The board depicts a numbered path from the lab to the house. Each space on the path has several characteristics, like color, weather, terrain, or various icons. Each turn, one player picks up a route card and marks the first two spaces of the professor's path on the board. The other players then try to deduce the next spaces of the given route, in correct order. For each wrong answer, the active player gets a point. The other players get points only by solving the route.

There are 702 different routes in the deck. The routes vary from simple like every even space or all spaces with three icons to complex like all forests without owls or clouds or green spaces on the upper half of the game board.

15153,The Flowers of the Forest,1995,7.42949,39,2.7,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Renaissance Wargame ,,"A simulation of the battle of Flodden, 1513.

Re-published in Battles magazine #9.


(from the designer:)

The Flowers of The Forest covers the Anglo-Scots battle of Flodden in which an invading Scots army under the charismatic James IV was destroyed in hand-to-hand combat by the Earl of Surreys force. This was a clash between numbers of weapon-systems. The English had mostly bill and bow, though their light cavalry (the moss troopers) used a small crossbow called a latch. The Scots had changed over to the pike and were well supplied with cannon. I have assumed the Highland formations were not pike armed but used the more traditional sword and axe.           
           
The battle was one of the last with a medieval format of a small number of large battles  six a side at Flodden. These units manoeuvre on a map of the area around Flodden hill from which the Scots descended. The counters representing the bands of men are stored on Arrays which are displays that resemble a plan view of the unit counter. You will typically put the best bands at the front, and will also consider whether to put bows in the front line or in the rear.           
           
The combat system models the degradation of combat effectiveness as losses and morale reductions take a toll. However, just because the less experienced men at the back of the unit are unhappy does not mean that the unit will break. The key individual captains and Big Men of the front-line units must be defeated. When a unit snaps the entire unit will rout.           
           
The order system models the difficulty of controlling large bodies without radios. It also addresses the great independence (in practice) of Scots nobles over their Sassenach equivalents. The game is not balanced but plays quickly so that each player may have a turn at each side.

You need to buy more boats to increase the columns on which you can fish. You need to buy reef cards (5 in total) on which you breed the parents, first to get 5 offspring wins. There are also pearl cards, which act as joker worms, and sharks, which eliminate cards by eating them.

There is a deck of offspring, 4 are dealt up, being combinations of the 5 colors. So there are blue green fish, pink yellow fish, purple purple fish. The parents are in the same colors, some male, some female. So, for example, to collect the blue green baby fish, you need a blue male and green female, or a blue female and green male. Any used cards go to the discard, which gets shuffled round and feed back into the reef. The cost of cards depends on their position on the reef, and there is a rule for flowing cards through past your boats.

The Reef is part of the Kosmos two-player series.

26250,A las Barricadas!,2006,7.10231,65,2.7333,2,2,120,120,Wargames,Wargame ,Dice RollingHex-and-CounterSimulation,"On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machados two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.

The  opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Francos army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.

From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and lightning war. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.

To the Barricades!, the first title in the War Storms series, is a game which attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually happened.

645,Bosworth,1998,5.82396,338,2.1034,2,4,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Grid Movement,"Bosworth is essentially a chess variant for up to 4 players.  The pieces are the same as chess (8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, a king, and a queen), but they are represented as disks so that they can be drawn randomly from a pile.

Players begin the game with 4 pawns in their edge of the board or field camps and four pieces from their draw pile as their hand.

On each turn, a player must move or capture with one piece, fill empty spaces in their field camp with a piece from their hand, and then draw to bring their hand up to four pieces.

Pieces move and capture just like in chess, except for pawns, which can move sideways and capture in any diagonal direction, and kings, which can capture their own pieces to escape check.  As in chess, the object is to checkmate all opponent's kings.

The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (50-foot glow worms, anyone?), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.

Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.

The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; and when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.

This game was remade into Monsters Menace America.

The Di Renjie deck of cards contains three cards for each individual target, weapon and location. At the beginning of the game, one card of each type (Target, Weapon and Location) is secretly placed under the game box. Players try to collect as many clue sets (all three matching cards of a single type) to deduce which card of each type is under the game box.

After eight sets are collected, the game ends when the last player finishes her turn. Each player writes her answer on a piece of paper (or mobile phone) before revealing the three cards under the game box. If players together as a team successfully deduce all three elements, each player receives points for her correct deduction and clue sets collected. The player with the most points wins. However, if the players weren't able to deduce all three aspects of the crime as a team, they fail, the murder takes place, and all players lose the game.

The White Mage Jasper is quite the famous gardener and his pumpkins always win the blue ribbon at the local faire. His long-time adversary and neighbor, Zot the Necromancer, who is not good at growing living things, has summoned an army of the undead to smash all of Jasper's prize-winning pumpkins. Help Jasper defend his pumpkins by turning Zot's shambling minions into delicate white flowers and then burning them to ash!

Game play borrows heavily from classic arcade games such as Space Invaders and Puyo Pop.  The player moves Jasper horizontally along the garden path while casting spells to either transform the approaching zombies into flowers or ignite those flowers and any nearby zombies with magical fire.  The more you destroy with a single spell, the more points you earn.  If you can survive both waves of Zot's undead army, you win the game and earn a score based on how well you did.

Living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering, when few who remain will battle to the last. In the end there can be only one.

Welcome to the incredible world of the immortals, the world of Highlander!  Based on the immensely popular motion pictures and television series, of the same name, Highlander:   The Card Game 2nd edition  is a collectible trading card game of swashbuckling swordplay and dark intrigue.

The first Highlander movie was released in 1986, and became a cult classic.  The movie starred Christopher Lambert as the hero, Connor MacLeod; Sean Connery played his friend and mentor Ramirez; and Clancy Brown assumed the role of The Kurgan, Connor's most deadly enemy.  Three sequels were produced, and a television series starring Adrian Paul as Connor's dashing cousin, Duncan MacLeod.

In Highlander: The Card Game 2nd edition, players assume the roles of Immortals like Connor, Ramirez, The Kurgan, and Duncan. These Immortals are mysterious wanderers who can only die if their heads are severed from their bodies. Immortals spend eternity honing their sword-fighting skills, trying to reach the time of The Gathering, when they will battle to the last. To the victor goes The Prize, an enigmatic goal of legendary proportions that no one really understands. It is simply known among them that he who wields its power will command the destiny of the entire world. Quite a prize indeed.

To attain this goal some Immortals will stop at nothing, while others follow a stricter code of honor and decency in their quest. In the end, for better or worse...

There can be only one.

Highlander: The Card Game is designed to simulate a duel between two Immortals: yourself and your opponent. During the course of play, both players will play attacks and defenses as if they were fighting with swords. Other cards will represent the tricks, tactics, schemes, and plots you utilize to win.

The map is divided into 6 regions consisting of 30 territories. Some of the territories contain rough terrain and are harder to attack.

There are 4 different basic starting setups for the 2 players. All of them include a neutral player. To win, a player must keep his capital and achieve 3 goals. All goals are public. For each setup a different combination of 8 of the available 12 goals is used.

In the Command Centre version, one player sets up both sides and the neutrals then the other choses which one to play and who starts. Each side is able to add support to the neutral player, and your defeated armies can be used to gain special bonuses. One of the bonuses even allows you to attack with (some) neutral armies.

Armies are still raised based on the number of territories and any regions you own, but also on the number of cities. As in standard risk, area cards are still gained upon conquering a territory, and can still be used to raise additional armies. The army units are in the shape of small (flat) arrows.

Manufacturer's description (translated from the Dutch edition):
RISK for 2 players. Battle man-to-man in this strategic battle of epic proportions. In this exciting strategy game everything revolves around the conquest and domination of Europe. For 12 years and up.

Two distinct ways to play the game:
Base training - an introductory game which you can play within a few minutes.
Command centre - a fast and exciting strategy game in which everything revolves around conquest and domination.

At first spread over a vast area, these two armies eventually assembled and fought four legendary battles at Quatre Bras and Ligny on the 16th of June, and then two days later at Wavre and of course Waterloo, called Mont St Jean by the French, and La Belle Alliance by the Prussians.

146451,Wrath of Kings,2015,8.16,40,3,2,0,0,90,Wargames,Fantasy Miniatures ,,"A new miniature tabletop game.

The website explains Wrath of Kings is a miniatures war game, where players take command of the armies of on of the five kingdoms of Arikania!  Scalable from 10 to 50 models per side, now you can vie for the throne of the Ancient King!

With a unique one roll resolution system and an active chain of command, you'll feel like you're actually in charge of an army without being bogged down in tedious tracking.  Combat is fast, fluid, furious and tactical - your decisions will matter on the battlefield!

There are five initial factions:

House Teknes

The armies of Teknes are some of the most well rounded troops. They are able to move from a defensive posture to attack in the blink of an eye. Both the Union Workers and Defender Linemen punish their enemies for attacking them. Their specialists and characters often employ lightning and magical wards to bolster their own defensive lines. No army attacks Teknes battle lines without expecting heavy casualties.

House Shael Han

The Shael Han fighting style is a mystery to all of their enemies and for good reason. The Legionaries are some of the weakest troops on the field by themselves, however whenever they are close by a specialist they become a force to reckon with. The Wrath led by their Big Sister are experts in engaging more than one enemy at a time. The true strength of any Shael Han army are their specialists, vulnerable by themselves but extremely powerful when working together they can cause a symphony of destruction on any battlefield.

House Nasier

Nasier love nothing more than to see their enemies wither in their path. The Nasier Ashmen charge is legendary and few enemies have ever lived to tell the tale. Theyre often supported by the Pelagarth who revel in combat and despite their lack of armor, cause more casualties then they take. The specialists of Nasier prefer to use flames to punish their enemies. One of the most aggressive armies, their zeal for reinstating the Efrenti presence leads them to wrought destruction throughout the continent.

House Hadross

As the most defensive army in the game, Hadross units become stronger both offensively and defensively as the game progresses. With each Deepmen lost, enemy models receive Resonate markers, which makes them easier to kill. Meanwhile the slower yet deadlier Sevridan keep enemy units from fleeing the battlefield. The Hadross specialists enhance the battlefield adding water elements to increase movement.

House Goritsi

Combining the fastest movement in the game with some of the strongest attacks Goritsi prefer hit and run tactics to conventional warfare. Players can employ the blazing speed of the Skorza to flank their enemies while their lethal Zeti hold the line. The terrible Blood Engine consumes the flesh of his enemies to heal his wounds. If you prefer high mobility armies and attacking first, Goritsi is the army for you.

The models are in plastic, with weapons in polystyrene so that they keep nice straight edges on spear shafts, handles, and large sword blades etc.

The goal is to beat your opponent. You can get it by K.O. or by judges scoring at the end of the fight (going to the scorecards). 
The game consists of 12 rounds as in a boxing match. You have a number of attacking and defense cards (value from 1 to 5) that can be managed each round. There are different cards:


    attacking cards ( punch and feint+punch )
    defending cards ( block and dodge ) 


Cards are played following a few simple rules. This will affect ENDURANCE and DAMAGE tracks of both fighters. Damage points can get a knockdown (and youll have to try if your boxer stands up or not) and if there are cuts. You have 100 endurance points to manage all over the fight. 
The way of playing cards sometimes is face down or face up (bluffing mechanic). If you play smart, you'll see it only doesn`t depend on the cards value, but also the way you raise your strategy in each round.
  
 At the beginning of each round, there will be an auction using endurance points to see which boxer has initiative for that round.
  
Feints, blocks, damage, punches, endurance, counter attacks, combos, initiative, knockdowns, knockouts... are some elements included in this funny and strategic boxing card game where you get a highest interaction each time the bell rings. Depending on your cleverness and the correct strategy the referee will raise your arm or your opponents at the end of the fight. Youll win by a knockout or youll finish kissing the canvas.

The action is fast and realistic; the system is easy-to-learn.

In War Stories you are the commander issuing orders to infantry squads and armored fighting vehicles. Each game presents a scenario using modular map with different terrain that regulates movement and impacts combat in a unique system that does not require charts or endless modifiers. Players receive a secret set of instructions with hidden deployment and objectives. Unit blocks have a variety of information that regulates their ability to move, fight and remain cool under fire.

War Stories also offers rule breaking asset and event cards. These enable War Stories to have additional complexity with minimal rules weight: the rules and effects are on the cards themselves. Assets are special equipment, troops, and abilities that a player has access to during the battle, such as machine guns, infiltration units, and the ability to lay mines. Events are random things that happen and create memorable moments on the battlefield such as reinforcements arriving, a gust of wind that starts a wildfire, or a damaged vehicle suddenly brewing up.

One side represents the Dark Lord's invading army, while the other plays the heroes defending the realm.

Fourteen battlefield cards are included in the game, and three are laid out at random over which the sides will compete. Players take turns playing cards onto one of the battlefields in play in order to build up enough strength to claim that battlefield card. (Players hold seven cards with two players, five cards with four, and eight vs. four/four with three.)

Each battlefield card bears a special power that the winner of that card receives as a reward, such as Remove all cards from one battlefield, Choose the next battlefield to activate, and Force the loser to give up one won battle.

The first team to claim any five battlefields or three battlefields of the same color wins, although rules are provided for shorter games.

NOTES:

Another version of Wizards of the Coast's dungeon crawl board game-style introduction to DD, inspired by boardgames like HeroQuest and Advanced HeroQuest (which in turn were inspired by the original Dungeons  Dragons role-playing games.) These basic/starter boxed sets attempt to bridge the gap between miniatures board games, miniatures war games, and role-playing games by using a board-and-counter/miniature format with simplified versions of the Dungeons  Dragons rules.

This entry returns to cardboard counters used in the 2000 Adventure Game version, after a couple Basic Game versions using miniatures released in 2004 and 2006; this version updates the rules set to DD 4th Edition, and continues the tradition of including completely new adventures and selections of monsters and pre-generated player characters, but is otherwise virtually the same product as its predecessors, and this line of games would be joined in 2010 by yet another updated, Red Box 4th Edition Essentials basic/starter game version.

All these basic/starter games are direct fore-runners of the Dungeons  Dragons Adventure System boardgames (Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon), which are still simplified versions of the DD rules set using tile-based game boards and miniatures.

The box cover of this version says 2-5 players, but there are enough included materials for 6 players (5 pre-generated Player-Characters, and one Dungeon Master.)

Your 8 figures are numbered 1 (Prince), 2 (Samurai) or 3 (Fighter) and may only move their number of spaces. Finishing a move on an opponent's piece is a strike and it is removed from the board. Strike a prince and the player is out of the round, though their pieces remain on the board. Get your Prince to the centre and score 5 bonus points, whilst all remaining pieces score their value. Play a few rounds and most points win.
Interesting abstract game, was very popular in Germany and often reprinted.

Description for Kaiser, Knig, Edelmann (Emperor, King, Nobleman)

Each player tries to be the first to reach the castle with his prince. At the beginning of play the figures are arranged according to a certain starting order. The player, whose turn it is, moves one of his figures as many fields as it is allowed (3,2,1). If the figure moves onto a field with an opposing figure, this one is struck and taken out of the play. If it takes an opposing emperor out of the play in this way, that player is immobilized completely; his figures however remain in the game as handicaps. One may not jump over figures. Likewise it is not allowed to move through the palace or go back to the spot you came from. Additionally the player is obliged to move every turn. The emperor can move only to one crossing, the kings to two crossings and the noble men up to three crossings. The player whose emperor first arrives at the castle wins.

Pocket Madness is a fast-paced card game inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, known worldwide for his short story The Call of Cthulhu. In the game, you evoke the powers of the Ancient Ones to drive your fellow cultists mad while securing your path to victory. To play, you first deal each player two cards from a deck that contains cards numbered 6-12, then you count out 17 face-down cards, flip the remainder face up, shuffle the deck, then lay it out in a row so that all players can see the cards.

On a turn, you either take 1-3 cards, open a portal, or open an investigation. When you take card, you pick up the first 1-3 cards in the row, then add them to your hand. To open a portal, you lay down three or more cards of the same type, then take the portal matching the number on those cards. Each portal has a different power, and you can use any one portal power on your turn. If someone else claims a portal that you own, too bad! You just lost the portal! To open an investigation, discard cards numbered 6-12, after which every other player gains as many madness tokens as the number of investigations this round.

A round ends when one player runs out of cards or the card row runs out. In the latter case, everyone takes one final turn, then all players gain madness tokens equal to the number of different types of cards in their hand. If a player empties their hand, that player loses half of their madness tokens while everyone else gains one.

The game ends the round that a player has collected ten or more madness tokens.

The Dark Age of Britain, from the middle of the 4th century to the end of the 8th, was a time of violence and warfare, when charismatic warlords such as the fabled King Arthur could gather together armies and carve out their own kingdoms. With this new set of wargames rules, players can take on the role of these warlords and command their own armies on the tabletop. Written by the author of the popular Glutter of Ravens rules set, Dux Bellorum is an element-based system, where each base of figures represents 50 fighting men. Each player has a specific number of points with which to construct his force and can choose to a Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, or Sea Raider army. The game is then played out following a set of simple, fast-paced rules. A completely self-contained gaming system, Dux Bellorum is perfect for gamers who are looking for a way into fighting Dark Age battles without investing a lot of time or money in larger rulesets.

From the playtest introduction:

Dux Bellorum is an Arthurian-era Dark Ages wargame, set in the period from the mid fourth century AD to the end of the eighth century AD. The rules emphasise the influence an armys commander has on his units, with simple manoeuvre rules and chaotic, swirling close combat. You'll win by inspiring the right troops at the right time, balancing quality versus quantity in your army, and by finding a sprinkling of luck at the right time.

All distances are given in Base Widths, which allows the game to be used with any scale of miniature based in many different ways. An army usually has 6-12 units, and each unit is rated for Aggression (Attacks), Protection (Defence), and Cohesion (Strength) and is trained either as Shieldwall, Warriors, Riders, or Skirmishers (all of which operate differently in the game).

Dux Bellorum armies are selected from following lists: Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, Land Raider, Sea Raider.

During each yearly turn, a player bids upon properties and slaves, establishes colonies, and maneuvers his ships for either trade or piracy. He is free to perform almost any negotiation or deal with the other players.

In 1605, the treasure player (usually the Marqus) sails the first treasure flotilla, using either his own fleet, or a contracted foreign one. If the voyage successfully avoids the pirates of the other players, the treasure is divided up as agreed among the collaborators.

The player finishing with the greatest gold and treasure wins.

While holding a balance between fighting the other warlords and control of their own realm, the players strive to become the most powerful warlord under the heavens of Japan. Are you going to use your resources to build castles, armies or cannons? Or do you establish a town of fine arts?  Famous generals from the Sengoku jidai period will have an appearance, with the only slight difference being that they appear as cute girls.

You can re-roll the dice several times but have to set at least one aside each time. 
The dragons are initially at risk from capture by other players but on your next turn you can set them into your secure layout. At the end you score points for having dragons of one colour or different dragons but with the same background landscape.

141829,7-Card Slugfest,2013,6.0552,173,1.5,3,8,30,30,,Card Game Fighting Party Game Real-time ,Take ThatVariable Player Powers,"All was peaceful in the idyllic land of Indines until a powerful artifact, the Belt of Beatdown, was discovered by the villainous Wardlaw O'Brien. With the belt, O'Brien was able to absorb the bar-fighting powers of the greatest fist-fighters across the world. O'Brien scheduled a world-wide pub crawl and invited all the greatest fighters in the land to take part. Can you become the greatest fist-fighter in the World of Indines by fighting your way through seven rounds, punching and gouging your way to supremacy?

At the start of 7-Card Slugfest, each player chooses one of eleven characters and takes a set of seven cards associated with that character. In each set, four cards are simple punches  doing a variable amount of damage  while three also have special effects. At the beginning of each round of the game, players shuffle their deck and place it face down in front of them. A stage card is flipped over to show the rewards for first, second and third most KO points earned this round.

When someone yells fight, the players simultaneously start picking up cards from their decks, looking at them, then playing them on another character. Whenever a player runs out of cards, they take a drink token from a common supply. Their character's stamina is ten, plus or minus the value of that drink token. When everyone has played his cards, the next step is to resolve the stacks of cards played on characters, applying damage in the order it was dealt. If a character's stamina is equalled or exceeded, the character who achieved the knockout earns a KO point. If a character survives all the punches aimed at him, then he receives the KO point. Players can also score two KO points for knocking out Boris, a non-player character. KO points are turned into gold according to each round's stage card, and the player with the most gold at the end of seven rounds wins.

181959,Gipfelstürmer,2015,6.3425,100,1.5,2,4,30,30,,Dice ,Dice RollingPattern Building,"Whoever wants to overcome the footholds and foothills must be the first to get two of their pawns to the summit. This requires two things: a little luck with the dice, and the opportunism to be at the right place at the right time. In your struggle to reach the top, your opponents will jostle you toward the foot of the mountain. You can do the same right back, but you can also use a chain reaction to shimmy your way to the top.

In Gipfelstrmer, which translates as Summiteer but should perhaps be titled Footholds and Foothills due to the author, each player tries to reach the peak with their five mountain goats. On your turn, you can roll dice up to three times. At the end of the turn, you look to see if you fulfill the requirements to move one of your mountain goats toward the summit.

Each path up the mountain has its own dice combination. The closer to the peak, the larger the required dice results (from three-of-a-kind and small straight to full house or five-of-a-kind), and the narrower the paths. In spaces of the upper half of the game board, there is room for only one mountain goat to stand. If you reach an occupied space, you may push one of your goats there one space toward the peak; on the other hand, you push one of your opponents' goats back toward the valley. Whoever can get two of their mountain goats to the summit first wins.

The German player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by isolating or capturing Moscow, or by seizing all the other key cities on map. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires that he prosecute local counterattacks.

Play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their offensive on 1 October 1941 and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objective. Play may end sooner than the historic termination time if either player concedes defeat prior to the official end of a game.

Each hexagon on the map represents 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with some brigades and one elite super-elite regiment. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout much of the campaign are built into the game's movement and combat rules. Each game turn represents a week. The game uses a derivation of the well received system from our boxed game Drive on Stalingrad, 2nd edition.

You are pirates who just looted a ship and must negotiate how to split the treasure. There are seven types of loot with values from 1 to 3. At the end of the game, you only score the treasure types you have the most and least of.

On each turn, open four new treasures: two in front of you and two in front of your neighbour. Simultaneously decide how to split them. Choices:


     Peace (I want the 2 in front of me)
     War (I want them all)

If both players choose peace, split the loot evenly. If both choose war, lose all treasure. If both choose first pick, lose all treasure.

Highway to the Reich is a tactical simulation of the largest airborne operation in history. Over 35,000 men belonging to 1st Allied Airborne Army dropped from the skies of Holland. Their objective: capture and hold a highway. The result: a salient into German territory that lacked only the last objective, and was thus a tragic defeat.

The 2,000-plus counters detail Brereton's Airborne Corps of three divisions, the units of Brian Horrocks's 30th Corps, and Model's scattered and dishevelled forces at company level for infantry; battery level for artillery, anti -tank and anti-air; and troop level for tank and armored cars.

The four maps cover the area from the front along the Meuse-Escaut Canal to the land, nearly 200 hexes away, surrounding the Arnhem Highway Bridge. Each map is positioned to cover the operational area of one airborne division. That allows one-division scenarios.

The system focuses on the interaction of two variables: fire power and morale. The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase. All the activities of each formation are completed before those of another are begun. Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities. Those variables create the framework within which the players operate.

Optional rules focus on hidden movement and multi-player variations, as well as giving the Allied player the opportunity to execute his own operational plan.

The Vampyre game is faithful to Stoker's original novel. It may be played by up to 6 people, each playing the role of one of Stoker's characters. Many of the game elements are also derived from the book. In Stoker's novel, Dracula did indeed hide coffins in various secret locations so that he would always have a place to hide during the day, should his principle (sic?) lair be discovered. Dracula did have vampire brides and could command wolves, rats, bears and other supernatural beings. Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.

The Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.

The extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins. Now they must track down and destroy the Count himself in his heavily guarded lair.

Theomachy lets you take the place of a high god  lord of a group of devoted followers. Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.

Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.

The game is quick to play  typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)

Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.

Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.

Use your gods power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more. Even the Lovecraft pantheons have myth cards and their own dark miracles. Place Wilbur Whateley in the forefront of your fight, or wield the Pallid Mask!

Theomachy: The Warrior Gods includes four pantheons: Celtic, Norse, Slavonic, and Lovecraft's Great Old Ones.

World Edition) uses the same game play as the other Ausgerechnet! titles: Players deal three piles of 15 location cards from a deck of roughly 200 cards (naming cities around the world for this edition), then place an interlude card between each set of piles to make a deck of 45 cards. One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.

On a turn, a player draws a location card  keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players  then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is Honolulu west of San Francisco? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.

After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct  and the card placed wrongly  the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.

After 15 cards are placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.

After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.

The system takes away from Second World War and goes to Ancients. In 264 Roma was summoned to Messina by Mamertines mercenaries to help in their quarrel with Cartage, the main power in Sicily. Carthaginians count on Hiero the Tirant of Syracuse to help defeating the Mamertines. Here begins the First Punic War.
Romans and Carthaginians fought for 22 year over Sicily and in North Africa. Rome emerged victorious and Cartage was obliged to quit his long standing presence in Sicily.
The land campaign was a long string of Roman victories as city after city was subdued and every Carthaginian army was defeated in battle. Syracuse was forced to make an alliance with Rome and Cartage was left with only a few fortresses in the island.
Anyway the war was won and lost in the sea. The war saw the emergence of Rome as a sea-power and a long string of naval victories allow Roman troops to menace even Cartage proper. Only to be saved by Xantipus and his mercenary army at the Bagradas Plains battle. Naval warfare played a prominent role in this war and will give Carthage Senate his las blow. Carthage tried to spend the Roman effort during the whole war. His strategy was of attrition and was unsuccessful; Rome never gave up a prize.
The game is developed in an operational scale  area-based map. It is designed for two players with one running the ROMAN forces and the other the CARTHAGINIAN forces -including Syracuse. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters. The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.
The ROMAN player will be on the offensive during the whole game as he has to conquer the whole island to get victory. CARTHAGINIAN player focuses on spoiling Roman campaigns and plans with ambushes, sallies and bad weather cards. Also he has to recruit an army as he doesnt has any at the beginning of the game.
The ROMAN player must plan his offensives carefully as he will need a new army and resources for each one. Also he will need to build a fleet his doesnt have at the start of the war. The sea contest will be evenly match and you better take into account bad weather as it sinks more ships than enemy action.
Siege warfare takes a prominent role in this game as every city in the game map is a walled on with his own intrinsic garrison.
Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward. Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience. We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.

Components:
- 1 80x60 cm map of Sicily and North Africa.
- two ten-sided dice
- 176 unit counters
- 1 Rules Book for the Series Campaign Commander and Exclusive Rules of Punic Island; historical and designer notes.

It is a set building game, normally played with four people in two teams.  It typically uses four or five regular poker decks including the jokers.  Each player starts with two piles of eleven cards.  One pile is their hand, the other, their foot.  The players draw two cards a turn, playing some if they choose and then discarding one at the end of each of their turns, except if they want to go out, when they will have to play every card.  Once a player has played all the cards in their hand they will pick up their foot.  Sets are comprised of 7 cards of the same number.  Sets may have wild cards in them, jokers and twos, but then the set is no longer clean, it would then be considered dirty.  A team needs two clean sets and two or three dirty sets to go out.

Hand and Foot is also commonly known as clean and dirty.

The rules for each Crusade share the same basic mechanics however the 3rd Crusade scenario is designed as a two-player only game, while the 1st Crusade scenario is intended for multi-player play, and has additional rules covering diplomatic and economic elements.

Distinguishing features:

    Combat occurs within hexes.
    Sieges play a significant part in the game.
    The 1st Crusade scenario creates a co-operative yet competitive game in that the crusader players must co-operate for the Crusade to succeed yet still need to pursue their own objectives (the same applies to the Muslim players).
    Lots of atmospheric 'chrome', individual Crusader and Muslim leader are present as units, random events (plague, visions, treachery etc), Armenian and Byzantine intervention.
    All orders for a turn are pre-written - makes for a long game (particularly the 1st Crusade scenario).
    The map covers South-East Asia minor down through the Holy Land and Northern Egypt. Constantinople and the early part of the rout of the 1st Crusade is therefore not covered.




One of the few  strategic level treatments of the Crusades. GMT have subsequently published 'Onward Christian Soldiers' (also by R.Berg); Columbia have published 'Crusader Rex', and Multi-man publishing have published Kingdom of Heaven.

This was published as both a boxed set by SPI and in their Strategy  Tactics magazine #70.

143701,Romance of the Nine Empires,2013,6.42637,102,3,2,5,45,45,,Card Game Fantasy Fighting Movies / TV / Radio theme ,Deck / Pool BuildingHand Management,"This description's a bit tricky, so let's take it in stages...

Countermay: The Tapestry of Worlds, the crossroads of civilizations beyond imagining. After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots. Can you save Countermay from its invitable doom?

Romance of the Nine Empires is a fictitious interactive collectible card game (CCG) set in the fantasy world of Countermay. In the game, players assume command of one of nine vastly different warring factions  including steampunk aliens, a dark god-king's crusade of conversion, displaced WWII-era American GIs, and a risen empire of the undead  to expand, glorify, or defend their empires. Through its fictitious fifteen-year history, players have shaped the world of Countermay through their individual and collective achievements, and the results are reflected in the story and the current state of the empires. That concept was inspired by the Legend of the Burning Sands CCG, which in turn is based on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG: in those real-life games, tournament results affect the actual story in future expansions.

The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game.  Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for The Gamers: Hands of Fate, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E.  The real-life release is not a collectable game, but a boxed set with a set distribution of cards. This boxed set represents the fictitious 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing characters for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.

So there's 3 levels of reality at play here:


     the CCG game called Romance of the Nine Empires, pictured in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is played by the characters at Gen Con Indy 2012 and is 15 years old;
     the fantasy world of Countermay, which is pictured in the CCG game and whose history is shaped by the players of the CCG game;
     the real card game Romance of the Nine Empires, edited by AEG in 2013, which comes in a boxed set and is inspired by (and presented as) the fictitious CCG.

Parlay uses an artistically enhanced 52 card deck of familiar playing cards, with the addition of a letter and point value on each card. Players decide which cards to hold and which to exchange in an attempt to improve their word, their poker hand, and hopefully both.

Like traditional poker, players can enjoy a variety of games like the favorites 'Texas Hold'em' and 'Five Card Draw', or original games like 'Unlucky 7's' and 'Wild I's'.

Unlike traditional poker, Parlay involves no betting or wagering. However, players are faced with an element of poker-style risk, where every hand they must decide whether to 'FOLD' for guaranteed points, or risk their points and 'STAY' in an attempt to win out over opponents for big point bonuses.

Parlay also introduces 'Wordbluffing', where players are invited to play oddly spelled words to trick their opponents into calling their bluff to knock them out of the hand. Players can also try to get away with fake or misspelled words, hoping their bluff won't be called. Wordbluffing usually results in lots of laughs.

Parlay comes with a deck of 52 casino quality playing cards, 2 jokers, 1 info card, 6 stay/fold game chips, 80 sheet score pad, and an instruction booklet. Players 2-6, Ages 9 and up.

You begin a game of Empyrean, Inc. with a single planet under your control - your Home Planet.

Or buy action cards that give random but powerful benefits. You can also trade resources with your fellow players.

Or you might want to hold onto them, because once you have three of a particular resource in your hand, you can lay them down in front of you. Once you've laid a resource down, you can add additional cards to the set as you get them. When the set contains seven cards, you've cornered that resource.

From the ashes of a devastating third World War, a precious few golden cities emerge offering hope to those who struggle for survival in the wastelands. Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:


    Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.
    Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.
    Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.


In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill  mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic  and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.

The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.

Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.

25190,Pink Godzilla Dev Kit,2006,6.53162,117,1.95,2,4,30,30,,Card Game Humor Video Game Theme ,Auction/BiddingHand ManagementSet Collection,"Quality or quantity? Racing to build parody video games such as 'Pinky Gear Solid' and 'Elder May Cry', you are a game developer competing for the components needed to create games in four genres: RPG, Fighting, Music and First Person Shooter games.

Each video game has some basic components (title, character, gear) that are essential, but can also include optional components (extra characters, gear upgrades, easter eggs) that increase the video game's market value. The video game components (cards) also double as money for purchases and auctions, so you're constantly struggling to manage your hand and make trade-offs on what to acquire and what to give up in return.

The best video games get victory point bonuses but the game ends immediately as soon as any developer releases four video games to market. So you have to decide: do I wait to put in that snazzy Easter Egg and create the best video game or do I beat the competition by releasing more games to the market?

Pink Godzilla Dev Kit is a light/medium weight card game for 2-4 players, with enough interesting decisions and tension to satisfy serious gamers but not overwhelm casual gamers.

The game parodies everything from retro Nintendo classics to the latest Japanese imports featuring a pantheon of offbeat characters like Pixel, the Elders, Jumpman, the Ninja Suppressors, the Good, Evil and Neutral Guardians and Pink Godzilla himself. The artwork for the cards is original, refreshing, and oozing with theme.

Win or lose, serious and casual gamers alike will enjoy being able to create parodies of their favorite video games.

Movement direction is determined by card play and movement distance is determined by die roll. When your fighter moves off the front edge of the board, it loops back to the back of the board and continues. Damage is assessed by die roll and several hits are needed to bring down a plane (unless you hit the cockpit or the fueltank). A great quick play with some new strategy and an advanced version in the rules.

In the Sharks Sea, a lagoon at the Palantic Ocean, red and yellow sharks compete for the largest fish populations. Maneuver smartly and swim fast to eat the most fish!

(This is paraphrased from the publisher's site)
Both players are a type of sharks. You try to make your 'family' of 3 sharks (yellow or red sharks) the healthiest by having them hunt their desired type of fish (white, grey and brown fish). The goal is to attain a high health level, where health is the number of fish you ate less 1 (for the energy used to hunt). The populations of the 3 different types of fish grow during the game, so one needs to foresee and maneuver towards the larger fish populations to be in the right place at the right time.

Optional rules include a Virus that makes the fish sick (and adds no health to a shark), an Orca which competes with the shark to eat fish, and a Current which sweeps fish around the lagoon.

The start player chooses one item, then each player takes that item, places it above the green line on their garbage can playing board, then drops the item into the can. The next player then chooses one of the remaining items, and everyone drops this item, too. Players cannot touch trash in the can.

Big Deal, players compete to collect items to become a millionaire. The game consists of 110 cards, with each card being either an asset (e.g., home, yacht, stamp collection) worth $5-20,000 or silver (worth $25k) or gold (worth $50k); silver and gold are jokers and can represent any other asset. Each player starts with 4-5 cards in hand, and on a turn a player takes one of four actions:


    Play a pair of asset cards (or an asset and a joker) from hand, placing it mostly on top of any other cards acquired earlier.
    Play a card from your hand that matches the top card of the discard pile, then place this pair on your other assets.
    Attempt to steal the top assets from another player's collection.
    Discard one card from your hand.


When trying to steal, point to the top assets you want to take, then place a matching card (or a joker) from your hand onto the table. The player who owns these assets can then do the same thing. Players go back and forth this way, and the last player to play such a card keeps all of the cards played and the original assets.

At the end of each turn, players refill their hands to 4-5 cards as needed. Once the draw pile runs out and one player has no cards left in hand, the round ends. All players tally the value of all cards in their collection and add this sum to their total score. If a player now has at least $1 million, she wins; otherwise, players shuffle the cards and start a new round.

The game consists of 13 character cards, with 2 to 3 characteristics each. Each characteristic is shared by 3 to 5 characters. The cards are shuffled and one is drawn and put aside. This card represents the disguise chosen by Arsene Lupin. The other cards are distributed evenly among the players. The players now tally the total of characteristics they have on their cards (e.g. 2 detectives, 1 female, 0 genius etc) and note them for later use.

Players now take turns, asking a question to gather new evidence:

a.) To all players: Who has (at least one) of (this characteristic)?

OR

b.) To one player: How many of (this characteristic) do you have?

Using these clues the players try to figure out which disguise Arsene has chosen (i.e. which card is missing). Instead of a question, a player may announce which character he suspects to be Arsene in disguise. That player then secretly checks the hidden card. If the suspicion was correct, this player wins the game, otherwise the player is eliminated and the other players continue.

Players each have 2 pawns, 9 green walls (which are placed vertically), and 9 blue walls (placed horizontally). Pawns start on the color matching them, which are 4x4 squares in on each of the four corners of the 11x14 board. The object is simple: to get one of your pawns to a starting spot of your opponent. Each turn players can move one pawn up to two spaces, and also place one wall, useful for blocking off their opponent's move. Walls always cover two squares worth of area, and must be placed according to their color (vertically or horizontally). Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.

The objective of Operation Morsky was to surround and take the port city of Novorossisk, opening the way to a drive on Anapa which cut the main supply line keeping the German 17th Army alive in the Kuban-Taman area.

The game covers a battle of 9 1/2 days on a scale of one half mile per hex (800 meters) and one turn per day. Fighting takes place on beaches, in mountains, in an industrial city and in the air overhead, with the units involved being mostly of battalion or company size (roughly 100 men per strength point), with naval units representing one ship or two boats, and air units each representing ten aircraft.

There are some unusual concepts in the game system, as well as a considerable amount of detail.

This game was actually sold in card form.  Boosters only.  10 cards per booster.  5 game cards, 5 visual art cards.  No modifications made.  Now internet play has been fan-made.  Only published in Japan to my knowledge.

Basically, this is a modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe.  Play is on a 3x3 grid.  Each player has 5 cards he does not show the other player.  Cards are two-sided, one pink, one blue.  Cards are based on characters and monsters from the game.  There are levels of cards, each level containing monsters, guardian forces (summon monsters), or player characters (highest level).  Each player chooses a color.  Randomly determine who goes first.  Place a card on the grid.  Each card has a compass rose of 4 different numbers, 1-9, and then A representing 10.  Higher levels contain higher numbers.  If I place a card with the number 4 at it's north, and you place a card with a number 5 at it's south directly above mine, you flip mine, and both are now your color.  You are trying to get the most cards to your color.  You can chain cards too.  If you flip a card, it can flip other cards.  Each card is only flipped once per turn.  Some cards have an elemental symbol on them, giving a +1 number bonus against anything not of that element.

The nice thing is you only need 5 cards.  In FFVIII, you could actually take one of your opponent's cards they played with if you won.  House rules for this type of play vary.

Players command multi-battalion forces, using division-level tactics. Pre-game orders determine how units perform, with limited ability to change plans on the fly

No plan survives the first ten minutes of a battle. This truism is frequently misinterpreted and used by many to argue against the use of a restrictive command control system. Above all, it does not mean that a new plan can be extemporized to replace the faulty one. A commander adjusted as best he could, given the systematic limitations of his troops and the availability of reserves. These factors are of paramount importance in Spearhead.

From Avalanche Press Website:

During the early decades of the Twentieth Century, the United States Navy made plans to fight a host of potential enemies. Some of these future wars seemed inevitable, particularly that with Japan. Others depended on changes in current politics, but Navy planners wanted to be prepared just in case.

One of these plans, labeled Gold, studied a potential naval war with France. The United States had stood alongside its oldest ally during the First World War, but in the years immediately afterwards the Navy looked at the potential for radical politicians to change France from friend to foe. Also, the peace negotiations which followed the war revealed deep underlying tensions between the Americans and their European allies; some of the more paranoid came to believe the next war would be between Europe and America.

U.S. Navy Plan Gold is based on these plans. American officers believed the seat of conflict would be the same as that of the undeclared naval war against France in the 1790s: the Caribbean Basin.

U.S. Navy Plan Gold includes the ships projected by the Armee Navale but never built due to the Washington Naval Treaty: the large Gilles and Durand-Viel battle cruisers, Normandie and Lyon class battleships, and the very odd croiseur de combat battleship/carrier design. And of course the Americans receive a number of new ships, such as the alternate Omaha large scout cruiser design.

The tactical rules use simple but in-depth mechanics to portray the fighting styles of the period. They're so easy to remember that many of us haven't consulted the rules in tears, but just get by on the quick reference sheet.

The elegant campaign system is designed to keep book-keeping chores to a minimum while allowing platers to exercise grand strategy. Smooth transition from map to tabletop eliminates the friction that kills most campaigns.

Finally, the siege system presents you with the challenges that the great Vauban once put before engineers and generals.

Warfare in the Age of Reason has:
 Complete and tactical, campaign and siege rules.
 Army lists for the Wars of Frederick the Great, the Marlburian Wars, the Great Northern War, the French and Indian War, the Jacobite Rebellions, Clive's Conquest of India, and the American Revolution.

More expensive letter cards are less versatile, but they are worth more points and have increasingly powerful bonus effects when played - including messing with other players.

Instead of spending points to buy new cards, points from words can be 'banked' - once a certain number of words have been banked, each player gets one last chance to spell a word using their entire deck, then the player with the most points wins.

High Heavens is a two player, tactical strategy game played on a hex grid, pitting Norse gods against Greek gods. The game is won when either all 12 gods in an entire pantheon is wiped out, or when Asgard or Mt. Olympus is destroyed. Players draw five cards every turn and then are allowed 3 actions. These actions can include Invoking a god, Moving, Attacking, playing a Divine Power card, using a god's Special Ability or Acquiring a dropped bonus chip. Red chips are stacked under each character to represent that characters health. Modifiers such as Attack Bonus, Armor, or Disabled are also represented by different colored chips. No two gods are alike, and their actions and abilities closely correlate to the mythology they were derived from. The luck of the cards you draw forces you to change your strategy from game to game. There is no reshuffling when you are out of cards, so once a god is dead, they're dead. Game play takes about a half an hour to an hour, depending on the players' skill, luck of the draw and the strategies used.

Created by award-winning video game industry veteran Ryan Lesser (Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Beatles:Rock Band, Dance Central...), High Heavens is a 2-player, expandable board game that utilizes lessons learned from 15 years of video game creation and a lifetime of playing board games.

In this luck-free majority game, each player has three druids that he moves across the board. When a druid is moved, he usually leaves a stone behind, and in this way stone circles are eventually created on the board. Each time a player gains the stone majority within such a circle, he places a dolmen with a hidden number (1 to 4) in its center. Over time, stacks of dolmen grow all across the board.

The game ends as soon as any player runs out of dolmen or stones. For each dolmen a player has placed, he scores a number of points that depends on the dolmen's position within its stack as well as the size of the circle surrounding it. The player with the most points wins.

To win KIPP X, you must be the first to get rid of all your blocks. To do this, you carefully position them one at a time on one of the lifted-up halves of the cross-seesaw. At some point, however, the weight becomes too much and the cross-seesaw tips down. If this happens, you must take any block(s) that fall off. Thus, you can't be too bold when placing blocks on the upraised planks  but maybe you can place just one more block...

     Play a card face down on a pile in the middle of all players and claim to have seen a certain number of one of five kinds of animal; this number must be either higher than any previously claimed number or the same number of a larger animal.
     Not play a card and make a claim.

When a player doubts an opponent, all cards are revealed. If there are at least the number of animals that the previous player claimed, the doubter takes all the cards (which are worth negative points); if not, the person who made the claim collects them. But beware as the deck contains special cards  e.g., jokers that count as any animal and cards that reduce the number of animals seen  so no one can ever be sure which animals await.

103975,Ortus,2013,6.59595,74,3,2,2,30,30,,Abstract Strategy Fighting ,Action Point Allowance SystemArea Control / Area InfluenceGrid Movement,"As legendary warlords meeting in the fabled arena of Ortus to decide who is superior, both players command a band of handpicked warriors, all schooled in one of the prime elements. The Ortus arena is believed to be the origin of all things, the place where the prime elements were fed with the raw energies to shape the world as we know it. How true this is can be debated, but this is the only place where energy still flows freely in its purest form. Players must harvest these energies and channel them to their warriors as fast and unpredictable Wind warriors, clever positioning of supporting Fire warriors, and devastating blows from lethal Water warriors will all be necessary to claim victory.

Ortus takes place on a hexagonal board, with each player starting with eight warriors (two of each element) on the back row (the Haven) in an order of their choice. Ortus is played in rounds, which each consist of four stages:


     Collect energy: Each warrior on an energy well generates energy, which flows into the player's general pool.
     Maneuver warriors: Players can spend 1 energy per hex to move warriors to better locations or attack opposing warriors.
     Return the fallen: When the active player returns his fallen warriors to his Haven, his turn ends.
     Defend: Energy remaining from the maneuver phase can be used to defend warriors against incoming attacks; more specifically, each attack has a certain power, and if the defender is unable or unwilling to pay energy equal to this power, the warrior falls.


When a player occupies five energy wells at the start of his turn or has removed all eight opposing warriors, he wins.

Ortus has a gentle learning curve, starting with the Basic game, which can be taught in around eight minutes. From there, players can introduce the special rules for each of the elemental warriors one at a time to learn the full Advanced game. Each warrior has two unique skills that differentiate it from the others. Being able to move all of your warriors on the board gives an enormous amount of tactical options. The excitement of the game lies in the careful planning of your attacks, knowing when to advance and when to withhold Energy as well as knowing whether to save or sacrifice your warriors.

The Yvies discs have to be inserted into pirate sailing ships, and you begin your mission to be the first player to gain 10 victory points (standard game).

Well-known ports like Cartagena or San Juan have to be visited to earn money in order to acquire equipment for your ships.
Every port requires two commodities and offers two others.
The longer the journey and the more valuable your cargo the larger your profit - but beware: What also becomes larger is the possibility to be attacked by rival pirates !
Some ports are the home of traders where you can buy equipment. These equipments not only give you victory points but also help your mission: Sails shorten your journey time and help to flee rivals, cannons help to fight them, sailors help in melee combat and larger trunks help to enlarge your profits.
And if you are too much playing for your own profit all the players loose if the rival pirates occupy at least 5 ports!

The game offers much more, and all is controlled via the YVIO console in the middle of the game board, which interacts with the ships and their YVIES and the electronic devices embedded in the game board and - last but not least - with the boardgame players.

And there is still enough boardgame feeling with the game board, the ship pawns you move, a cardboard ship mat with cardboard equipment and cardboard dubloons.

You don't have to learn rules, as the console steers you via an introductionary game through the shallows of the beginner in multilingual speech if so desired.

By playing a card from your hand of either the same color (same location) or the same value (same trouble) as on the playing table, you clear one of the quests bestowed upon you. When one player has rid himself of all of the cards (quests) in his hand, or when a certain period of time has passed (when you've drawn four special cards from the draw deck), that round ends. The player who rid himself of cards gets closer to the High Heavens, but those with cards remaining are pushed away even further.

The gods can also use their faithful servants for their own purposes. They can help their masters to do away with surplus quests, or cause trouble for the other gods by imposing more quests on them. However, take care when you do this because all such acts remain in memory as bad karma. If you manage to complete all of your quests, your accumulated bad karma will be ignored, but if you fail and have quests remaining, they will become a heavy burden.

You will need to determine when to silently do your chores and when to use your servants to increase your chances of success.

You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.

The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.

Includes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.

Ten scenarios (including the Galactic Cycle campaign game) are supplied. A short game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long grand campaign scenario it is recommended to play at least 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 58 year cards, a 17 x 22 map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).

Historical Note:
Writing about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe. Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.

42255,"The Kaiser's War: World War I, 1918-19",2010,7.38684,38,2.6667,1,2,240,240,Wargames,Wargame World War I ,Hex-and-Counter,"The Kaisers War (KW), is an intermediate-complexity, strategic-level simulation of the last year of World War I in Europe, including an optional what-if extension into 1919. As 1918s campaign season opened, the Central Powers had defeated the Russian Empire and dominated much of Europe, yet less than a year later the Western Allies were triumphant.

The concept of victory points (VP) is central to play of game. Players begin each scenario with a designated number of VP. They may expend them to gain reinforcements and carry out certain actions. They gain new VP as a result of achieving objectives; they lose VP when they lose units in combat. To win the game you must have more VP than your opponent; so play is a balancing act between expending VP and attaining objectives.

This is a two-player game: one player controls the Central Powers; the other player controls the Allies. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. The map shows all of Europe from London to Moscow and south to Italy and Greece. Each game turn represents two months. Units of maneuver are mostly armies, along with certain elite and specialized corps. There are 17,500 words in the rules. Two experienced players can finish the shorter (historical) scenario in about four hours. Designed by Joseph Miranda.

The rules cover such things as: mobilization, replacements, unit conversions, trenches, fortified zones, fog of war, railroads, headquarters, air bases, naval bombardment, seasons, neutrals, Bolshevik and nationalist forces, critical cities, psychological warfare, morale, stand-fast orders, shock troops, proto-mechanized warfare, the Poles, the Allied Blockade, alpine units, the USMC, guerrillas, the Arab Legion, and much more.

The goal is to successfully kill your opponents within the rules of the game. Don't worry, the rules are carefully constructed so that no dangerous weapons are used. Typically the game is played in real time -- that is, the game is more likely to be played at school or at a game convention over a period of days or weeks than at a friends house in an afternoon.

There are many scenarios outlined in the game but the simplest is to give every player the name and picture (if necessary) of another player and a dart gun. If you successfully kill your target you take his target as your new target. You may not shoot at anyone who is not your target except in self defense. Obviously, there needs to be at least one moderator.

There are several other interesting scenarios as well as suggestions for far more elaborate and interesting weapons than dart guns. For example, there are sci-fi, mafia  and spy vs spy scenarios.

151369,Illegal,2014,6.34206,97,1.2,5,9,25,25,,Party Game ,ActingTradingVoting,"Description
ILLEGAL is a crazy, offbeat party game for 5 to 9 players where participants each take on the role of an illegal dealer. The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.

Launch into this risqu adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.

How to Play

ILLEGAL is played in two phases:

During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.

Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.

The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.

At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.

Scoring

At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!

In this abstract strategy/tactical game, 2-4 players want to collect their favored gods  Horus, Ra, Apep, and Khepri  in groups to earn points. They do this by rolling custom dice that both determine actions and are placed on the game board to count as a piece of the player's color. On a turn, the active player does the following:


    Roll: Take a die and roll it.
    Move: Move a die on the board that matches the rolled color exactly three spaces.
    Place: Placing the die just rolled on the board, possibly scoring a group.


The dice have four faces matching the players colors, with unused colors in a two- or three-player game being scorable by anyone. The other two faces  Yay-Ra and Ominotep  allow the player to move or reroll any die, respectively, and they count as wild once on the board. Groups of four (or more) dice of a color are scored immediately and give their player points equal to their number. The first player to 13 points (or 21 points in a two-player game wins!

The road to the Rhine, and beyond to Berlin, seemed wide open in the early fall of 1944. The German armies in France had ceased being organized formations and were streaming back to the Reich in willy nilly fashion, hotly pursued by the Western Allied armies as they dashed through Paris and to the borders of Germany. The First US Army (with the Ninth later on), hit the Westwall on September 12th and was destined to slog through the mud and rain for months against the fortifications and surprisingly resilient German reserves hurriedly thrown against them in a desperate bid to keep the American army off as much German soil as possible. Additionally, lack of supply served to further restrain the American advance. Would the war be over by Christmas, or would the Germans pull off a second Miracle of the Marne and hold long enough to launch a counteroffensive in the west ?


(from Decision Games website:)

HURTGEN: Hells Forest is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous campaign. The 2,240 counters in the game represent almost every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought in the battle, including US, German, British, and even Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider, and headquarters units are all fully represented in the counter-mix. The two map sections are an accurate representation of the battle area and were compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-1944 US Army map sources. The area portrayed shows all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain in relation to their suitability for armor and infantry, along with all the villages, towns and  cities that proved to be the bastions of the German defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn't be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.

THERE are three main scenarios representing each of the offensive periods of September, October and November. A smaller learning scenario depicts the US 28th Infantry Divisions ordeal as it attempted to drive on the Roer River dams through the forest of the area. Players may also play continuously from September to the first week of December (almost 300 game turns!). The big challenge for the allied player is to see if he can reach the Rhine River months ahead of the actual date, and shorten the war considerably. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.

THIS latest edition of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (which began with Wacht am Rhein) presents further refinements to the combat, artillery and supply subsystems in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare at this scale. For example, rules for Lull periods have been added in order to allow players to speed up game play during periods of relative inactivity. These Lulls compress game play from three turns per day to one, allowing players to cover longer intervals of historic time. Other additions feature level-two entrenchments that allow the German player to create fortified bastions in German towns and cities that can better withstand Allied barrages and ground assaults, along with rules that represent the logistical nightmare faced by the Americans during much of the battle.

THE orders of battle have been extensively researched in order to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides. The incredibly hodge podge nature of the resurrecting German army is shown through the depiction of the various rear area units and replacement army battalions that appear almost randomly throughout the game.

The centerpiece of this new release is the re-issuing of Narvik. This release ties into Grand Europa by providing state-of-the-art Order of Battle information on Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish armed forces from 1939 to 1945 and German Northern Theater armed forces from 1940 to 1943.

Five countersheets (1,400 counters) cover the entire theater of war.

Europa IV game.


(from back of the box:)

Narvik:
This is an intense combined arms game. Germany has an overwhelming array of ground, sea and air forces for the invasion. The Allies have time and space on their side. While they can not stand toe to toe with the Germans, they can cause a lot of trouble; they can win the game. This is the second most popular The Europa Series game ever produced. It has a very even play balance and offers unending variations.

Storm Over Scandinavia:
The code name of the invasion: Weserubung. It started out as a junior officer and high command war game. A what-if scenario on how to invade Norway. It ended up as a full-blown, multi-corps invasion on the event of Germany's attack on France. The Europa level invasion of Norway. The combined arms are also present. The unit and time scales are at Europa levels.

The Four Hour War:
Germany invades Denmark. Will the Danes resist (that would make it a Five Hour War)? Germany used Denmark as a stepping stone to Norway. Germany had to have a perfect invasion of Denmark to ensure a chance of success against Norway. If you choose to play this scenario, as the Germans, good luck. It is an eye-popping special ops gamble. If you lose as the Germans, no easy invasion for Norway.

Northern Theater of Operations (NTO):
NTO Combines Weserubung and A Winter War. It begins with the Soviet attack against Finland. The western Allies may intervene to aid Finland. To do so they must transit through Norway. Norway may disagree with this and the Germans may intervene to prevent the Allied intervention. Makes your head hurt, don't it? Ownership of A Winter War (currently available from Games Research/Design (GR/D)) is required for this scenario.

Invasion Sweden:
No tour of Scandinavia is complete without a visit to sunny Sweden, right? Well, why would the Germans invade Sweden? To prevent them from helping Norway? Maybe. To ensure a flow of iron ore to Germany? Perhaps. Because they can? Why not. Germany decided against this invasion, but now you have the option of testing out such an invasion in this scenario.

10022,La Révolution française: La patrie en danger 1790-1796,1995,7,52,3.6,4,6,180,180,Strategy Wargames,Political ,Area MovementSimulation,"(from the rulebook:)

The game starts in October 1791, when the Legislative Assembly is installed.  It ends in September 1795. The game mechanics are mainly diplomacy and negotiations.  Each player represents a Political Current (or simply a Current), because at this time, there was no permanent political party, but only shifting groups of politicians.  Each Current acts to strengthen its position and increase its fame.  The game uses also elements under no player's control, but which react to the players' actions.

A game can end in several ways, depending on the current political regime, and depending on each player's victory points.  In the real world, the end was the installation of the Directorate in September 1795.

One interesting feature of the game is the strict seating arrangement: Players are seated from left to right depending on the political stance of their Current (Sans-Culottes on the left, Royalists on the right, and everyone else in between).  One cannot leave the room to conduct negotiations, but one can whisper--thus it's easier to secretly negotiate with one's neighbor than with someone on the other side of the aisle.

It is the summer of 1943 and the fate of the Russo-German War - the largest land conflict of the Second World War - hangs in the balance. A decisive victory for either side means a profound change in the course of the war.

Clash of Titans: The Tank Battle for Kursk, 1943 is an operational simulation of the battle for Kursk which took place during July 1943. On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht attacked with 435,000 men in fifty divisions and 2,700 tanks and assault guns (including the new Panther and Ferdinand types). The Red Army was able to field 1,550,000 soldiers and 4,800 armored vehicles for this battle of titanic proportions. Operation Zitadelle had begun... Clash of Titans comes with two more scenarios, one featuring a hypothetical early German attack in May (favored by some German generals), the other simulating the historical Soviet summer counteroffensive in August. One side represents the German forces of 9th Army, 2nd Army, 4th Panzer Army, and Armeeabteilung Kempf while the other side controls the Red Army forces of Southwest Front, Voronezh Front, Central Front, Bryansk Front, West Front, and Steppe Front. It uses the highly popular Ring of Fire /Eastwall game system and is suitable for two or more players or solitaire play.

Ruled by the Councils of the four Cliques, the city is spilt into two prosperous disctricts. Players are in control of one of these two districts, and by drafting and playing cards depicting the city's Characters, they attempt to secure the support of the councils and have the best inhabitants.

The game begins with players drafting the 64 character cards to form two 32 card decks, one for each player.  During the player's turn, the player gains actions to play Character cards into his district.  Each character belongs to one of the four cliques, and many have special abilities, called Traits, that occur when they are placed into a district from a player's hand.  Additionally, at the end of a player's turn, the player will place a card from his hand face down on one of the council cards.  When a Character with the Ksari trait is played in a district, the corresponding Clique Council is convened, and the player with the highest value of face down cards wins the support of the convened council.

Players score points for the Characters in their districts, as well as points for the Council support they have received.

180355,Visby,2015,6.65328,61,1.25,2,2,20,30,,Bluffing Card Game Economic Medieval ,Commodity SpeculationSimultaneous Action Selection,"Visby is a short, but challenging game. Each player has an identical set of eight cards, each of them with a special effect.

At the beginning of a round, the common supply on the board becomes more attractive by adding seals (victory points) and wares and by improving the ratio to change wares into seals. All players choose one card from their hand simultaneously and place it face down in front of them (two cards in a two- or three-player game). Then the cards are revealed and the effects become active:


     Knights and Troops take victory points;
     Blacksmith gets wares for each Knight/Troops played by other players;
     Ships and Fleets get wares; Tollkeeper gets seals for ships and fleets;
     Merchant changes wares into seals;
     Monk gets wares for merchants and number of cards already played.


Players with a monk take all cards back to their hand, while others proceed with their remaining cards.

The specific issue is that the more efficient cards become effective only after those which are not that strong. For example, a fleet gets you three wares, but the ship gets you all the remaining ones. If there are ten wares and one opponent played a fleet, you get the seven remaining wares after he has taken three. If three other players play a fleet and take three wares each, you gain only one for your ship. How effective your card is depends on what the other players do  but you cannot be sure of what they'll do because all decisions are made simultaneously. Perhaps, though, you remember which cards the others have already played...

Visby comes in a basic set for two players and can be enlarged with one or two expansion packs that contain material for two additional players each (to the maximum of six players).

In a time long forgotten, the cruel Fomori rule over rin, the green island. They praise their king Balor, who reigns from his fortifications in the north with an iron fist. Old paths and ruins spread over the island's face, which will be called Ireland many generations from now. But new tribes arrive at the island striving for permanent presence. Who will control rin's fate over the next centuries to come?

Each player in The Arrival represents a tribe leader who tries to gain predominance over the mythical island of rin while pushing back the demon-like Fomori. But the players are facing a dilemma, for spreading too quickly means becoming more and more corrupt and strengthening the Fomori in their power...

Over 4-6 rounds, the players determine their resources by means of a unique game mechanism, which will be used later on profitably. During a first phase (Earning Phase), players draw four cards, each showing three sections of different resources. Two of these sections are gradually blocked by the player, thus leaving one section. The resources shown on this section are the ones the player gets. During this phase, they have to decide which section is the best one; while the upper section of the cards offers many resources, it also results in unwanted Corruption Points. The middle and the lower sections offer fewer resources, but also less Corruption.

After that, the Action Phase takes place and the players must use their resources wisely while having the choice from different kinds of actions in order to get Fame Points.

The game ends when a certain number of rounds have been played or somebody reaches the corruption limit.

The winner is either the one with the highest amount of Fame Points or the one with the fewest Corruption Points. This depends on the scene of the board at the end: Do the tribes (players) control more locations on rin than the Fomori do  or is it the other way around?

Variants for more are easily devised (last wizard standing, teams, etc.).

The two opponents perform 6 magical gestures with their hands to cast spells - each spell created by performing a specific sequence of gestures.  As gestures for the 2 hands are written secretly, then revealed simultaneously, there is ample ground for feinting - starting a sequence leading to a certain attack, then switching to a different sequence, hoping your opponent doesn't call your bluff.

The 40 different spells allow you to attack, defend, summon monsters, enchant your opponent (limit her play in different ways), and more.

To win, you need to make creative use of the many options, and keep an open eye towards your opponent's schemes.  This is a game of almost pure skill.

8402,The Great Pacific War,2003,6.67391,69,4.1111,2,7,360,360,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Chit-Pull SystemDice RollingHex-and-CounterSimulation,"Description from the publisher:

Great Pacific War is Avalanche Press' strategic-level game of the War in the Pacific. The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.

The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.

The facts:


     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34 x 22 maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.
     The game system is built around players drawing impulse chits to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).


The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.

In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japans lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.

In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.

Components:
Three 34 x 22 maps, 
560 playing pieces, 
rules, 
three scenario books, 
political events and charts.


Note: 
The maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. 
 The game marries up with JP's Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.

203270,Gorechosen,2016,7.58654,52,2,2,4,25,75,,Dice Fantasy Fighting Miniatures ,Deck / Pool BuildingDice RollingGrid MovementTake That,"From the publisher:

Are you ready to prove yourself Khornes mightiest, most ruthless champion? Gorechosen gives you the chance! This brand-new boxed game from Games Workshop lets four players slug it out for brutal supremacy in brutal pit fights. The box includes four plastic multi-part Citadel miniatures: the Exalted Deathbringer of Khorne, the Skullgrinder, the Slaughterpriest and the Aspiring Deathbringer with Goreaxe and Skullhammer  four iconic champions of Khorne.

The game itself is a simple, cunning and laugh-out-loud mix of subtle strategy and straightforward brutal combat, and four players can play through a game in about an hour. 24 action cards let your chosen fighter pick from a variety of painful attacks and gambits (our favourite being the humble Shove, should your victim happen to be standing next to one of the fire pits present on the games board) while 16 injury cards present, in gruesome detail, the inevitable results of standing in a spiked pit with three other crazed madmen. And the fun doesnt stop with the feuding  players who have been knocked out can still influence the game thanks to special Fate of the Slain rules. Full rules for these fighters are presented on four fighter sheets, and rules for four more (with miniatures available separately from Games Workshop) are included inside the games rulebook.

Each fighter has a unique Kill Zone which dictates what they can hit, and how powerfully. The Slaughterpriest in the box, for example, has enormous reach forwards with his axe (because its flipping massive) but is weaker when to the sides. (You can imagine an overhead chop, rather than a sweep around him.) Each fighter also keeps track of his wrath using the Wrath Track. Wrath can be spent to make actions, and is usually accrued when fighters are wounded  injury cards, which are received when combatants are damaged, affect wrath in this way.

Wrath also has an effect on who goes first, because the angrier fighters are, the more chance there is they will act first! Each turn, fighters put in a number of initiative cards equal to their wrath (each player has a unique design of initiative card), then the top initiative card is turned over, dictating who will act. After that player has made an action, the next initiative card is turned over, and so on and so forth.

It mostly follows the rules of traditional chess.

The whole chessboard has 10x10+4 squares: it consists of one large expanded 10x10 square with ten rows and ten columns of squares, as well as four additional squares which are located diagonally to each corner.

Those outmost corners are the opening position for the Wizards, one new kind of piece in Omega Chess. The other new kind of piece are the Champions, which are located in the corners of the 10x10 square, with a Pawn in front of them (there are ten in total) and a Tower to their side. The remaining pieces - that are also found on a traditional 8x8 square - are between the Champions and their Pawn, arranged as usual.

Similarly to the Knight, the new pieces are classified as leapers, which allows them to jump over pieces. A Champion can jump two squares in all eight directions. The Wizard can either jump three squares straight and then one square to either side, or move one square diagonally. Except for Pawns, standard pieces move as usual. Pawns are also allowed to move three squares from their initial position. As with moving two squares at once, they can be captured en passant when doing so.

162480,Rise of the Kage,2015,6.77746,71,3.125,2,4,60,60,,Adventure Dice Fantasy Fighting ,Co-operative PlayDice RollingModular Board,"In a game of Rise of the Kage, 2-4 players can choose to play as the ninja of the shadow wind clan; deadly warriors tasked with a variety of missions all ultimately focused upon taking down the Takashi clan, the Jwar Isles' ruling family. Or you can choose those that have sworn their lives to protect their Daimyo; the brave guards of the Prefecture of Ryu.

The ninjas play cooperatively discovering weapons from shuriken to poisoned rice, dispatching guards as they seek to complete their goals.

The guard boss employs all the resources at hand to bring their deadly foe to a halt. If they can hold them off until sunrise or raise the alarm then all will be safe for another night.

Ninja or guards, players face difficult decisions. Do the ninja recklessly force their way through their opponents whilst undoubtedly raising the alarm level, go too slowly and stealthily though and they face losing the advantage that night brings, dawn ultimately bringing an unreckonable force down upon them. Do the guards throw themselves in the way of their more deadly rivals or strategically attempt to slow them down? Rise of the Kage offers a great blend of sneaky skills and gobsmacking kills.

The silent Grayking, brooding upon his throne in the Tower of Ash, is a far-reaching shadow upon Lassadar. We feel his presence in each of our days. His servants grow bold, stealing into our cities, inhabiting the alleys and dark places of our streets. They jeer at us from our mirrors, shaming our reflections.

The books of the Council of Wardens, handed down to us across the years, say that the era of broken barriers is upon us. Omens tell us, by winter, the Grayking will break through the few defenses we have remaining, cross to Lassadar, and our lands will fall to despair.

We few who are left, who remember the Graykings original imprisonment across the Barrier Planes, struggle to keep his power from growing further, but we have little time and far too few disciples. You are young but have proven to hold the strength of our teaching inside you. We have trained you in the arcane arts of ice, oak and flint magic and have taught you those powers are capricious and can damage your spirit if relied upon too much. We wish we had more time to train you further. We do not.

Go now into the wider world, with our blessings, and seek a means to defeat the Grayking. Find the three Warding Keys stolen by his servants and re-lock the gates to force him back behind the Barrier Planes forever. Our agents, spread thinly across places still untouched in Lassadar, will aid you in your quest as best they can.

Go now, and save us all

Shadows Upon Lassadar is a solitaire fantasy quest game. You play a young magic adept who has been charged with finding three lost keys to lock the gates between the Barrier Plains and prevent the Grayking from reaching the world of Lassadar. You will journey to different cities using a deck of cards; other cards list spells you learn during the game. Magic in Lassadar is, however, a two edged sword and if you use powerful spells you may end up corrupting your own spirit in the process and lose the game. Three specific cards lead to expanded battle maps where you fight the Graykings servants for possession of the keys. The game uses a variety of AI mechanics to simulate an enemy that learns and adapts as the game progresses.

Needed to play:
the 48 game cards + the 4 last battle cards
9 six sided dice
25 black eurocubes
and 3 eurocubes: one each in red, blue and yellow.

This Print and Play game can be assembled as a deck of cards or as cards and a series of mini game boards.

There are several types of quests in the game that will need to be completed. These quests are encountered by turning over cards from the draw deck:

City Quest cards showing the name of the city youve journeyed to, win and loss table reference icons and event instructions for the battle in that city. As you win battles in these cities you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles.

Council of Wardens Quest cards always have a white top. Their event instructions will help you gain spells and refresh your Mana and Spirit. These cards will always be placed on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game.

Three Warding City Quest cards, each with a colored band and a numbered Warding Key icon across the bottom will signal when you use the Expanded Battle Maps (wargame hexmap style). On the Expanded Battle Maps you will encounter AI driven servants of the Grayking. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles. As you win the battles in these cities, and gain the Warding Keys, you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile, to be shuffled back into the game.

Winning or losing the game:

Draw cards one by one working your way through the quest. If you gain each of the 3 Warding keys you may cast the Oaken Spell: Barrier Lock and lock the gates of the Barrier Plains. The Grayking is instantly drawn back to the Tower of Ash and you have saved Lassadar and won the game.

If at any time your Spirit falls below [1] on the Character Stats card, or if the Grayking reaches Lassadar on the Progress Track, you have lost the game.

111999,Pharaoh Code,2011,6.12229,157,1.4444,2,5,20,20,,Dice Educational Math Number Party Game Real-time ,Dice Rolling,"In Pharaoh Code, you're trying to claim as many scarabs as you can by solving the aforementioned codes. To set up the game, you divide the number tiles into four piles based on the number of scarabs on them, with more scarabs typically signifying larger numbers. To create the number pyramid, you lay out one tile with four scarabs, two tiles with three, and so on.

On a turn, one players rolls the three dice  an octahedron, a decahedron and a dodecahedron  then all players try to use the four fundamental arithmetic operations to transform the numbers on two or three of the dice to match one of the numbers on a tile. For example, amongst the cards on the board is a 72 and you rolled two 8s and one 1; you can calculate 8 x (8 + 1) and the result is 72. As soon as a player has reached a target number, she takes that tile off the game board, then flips the thirty-second sand timer. Everyone else can grab one tile during this time, then once time expires the players must demonstrate how they reached the number in question. If a player calculated correctly, she keeps the tile face-up; otherwise she flips it face-down as a penalty.

Players then fill up empty spaces on the game board, then roll the dice again to start another round. As soon as a row cannot be filled, the game ends. Players then tally the scarabs they collected, subtract penalty scarabs, and see who has the highest score.

Newtown includes a three-tiered movement system that simulates the individual nature of Indian warfare.  Small war parties often acted according to their own will rather then following orders from commanding officers.

The game includes two decks of opportunity cards.  Each player starts the game with one card and, while the Indian player can earn one more by actions taken in the game, the American player may use momentum to purchase additional cards throughout the game.

Pre-game Indian Enhancement and limited American intelligence help provide play balance to an outnumbered Indian army.  Optional Indian reinforcements are also available.

Newtown also includes rules for Indian honor, resolve under artillery fire, ferocity and evasion.

In Oriskany, the Indian players secret pre-game selection of the ambush hex and the American players turn-by-turn choice for Herkimers rate of march will have profound effect on the course of play.  Proximity to Ft. Stanwix is not the only thing that must be taken into account.  If the column is ambushed while moving at an accelerated rate the ambushing Indians receive advantages.  On the other hand, if Herkimer approaches cautiously he can better defend against an ambush but risks losing army morale for progressing too slowly with the rescue effort.

Herkimers Tryon County Militia is made up of special 2-step, 1-strength point units permitting each unit to take a step loss and continue to fight.  This expedient is used to reflect the intensity of the fighting that occurred between the two forces.  Militia at Oriskany fought like veteran line units, giving and asking no quarter, for nearly six straight hours.

Oriskany also includes pre and post-ambush Sequences of Play and rules for laagering and limbering the American supply wagons, looting, detaching American garrison artillery and the possibility of storms.

2 errata counters are included in C3i #27 (2013)

Press your luck against other hunters in search of fame and fortune!

Hunters of Arcfall is a quick-playing dice and card game for 2-6 players. You start the game with players choosing a bounty hunter to play as. Players then take turns rolling dice to capture bounties; these bounties are shared amongst hunters so only the hunter who deals the final hit will capture the bounty. Only bounties that have been claimed are worth any points. You can claim bounties by ending your turn or continue the hunt and try to capture even more at the risk of losing anything you've earned. Each bounty is worth Fame and Fortune. You need Fame to win the game, but fortune will net you currency to purchase much needed Item Cards that help you manipulate the odds in your favor. Use your hunter's special ability to gain an extra advantage and press your luck if you think it's safe  you never know what lurks around the next corner.

A typical game of Hunters of Arcfall lasts between 15-45 minutes depending on the number of players and the point limit.

The expansion Tools of the Trade was initially planned as a separate item, but through Kickstarter funding, every copy of the game now includes this expansion. With Tools of the Trade, Hunters can purchase tools and items to help capture bounties or hinder their competitors.

The game board is 55 square fields large.

Each player controls 6 playing pieces i.e. stones with the numbers 1 to 6 marked on them.

The stones of player 1 are set up in the six fields of the upper left corner of the board and those of player 2 in the six fields of the lower right corner of the board so they face each other diagonally.

During his turn a player rolls a die, if he still has the stone with the number corresponding to the rolled value on the board he must move this stone. If the corresponding stone was already removed from play (see below) the player may choose to either move the stone with the next higher or the next lower number.

In his move player 1 may move the stone one field to the right, downward or diagonally to the lower right. Respectively player 2 may move the stone one field to the left, upward or diagonally to the upper left.

If a player ends his move on a field occupied by another stone, be it one of the opponent or one of his own stones, then this stone is removed from play.

To win the game a player must occupy the corner field of the opponent with a playing piece.  A player loses if he has no more playing pieces left on the board.

144460,Cycling Party,2014,6.98918,61,2.1,2,6,60,60,,Racing Sports ,Roll / Spin and MoveVariable Player Powers,"Cycling Party is a game for 2 to 6 players, which reflects the essential features of road cycling. Each player will select a cycling team and take responsibility for managing the movements of 5-6 riders in their team. The aim of each team will be to secure victory at the end of each stage or in the general classification.

The course is built from hexagonal tiles.  Each hexagon tile is divided in turn into three spaces, with each space representing a kilometre of the race. Mountain sections, intermediate sprints and the finish line are shown using indicator tokens placed at the kilometre points agreed upon by the players at the beginning of the race.

This game comes in three versions: Junior, Senior and Master.  Each version builds on the rules of previous versions.   In the Junior version each rider is moved by rolling two six-sided dice.  Riders in a peloton (at least five riders in the same space) may choose not to roll and instead move five spaces.  A rider in the peloton may choose to roll in the hope of raising its pace or of breaking away (roll of 10-12).  The difficulty of the mountain sections is represented by rolling just one dice.  Each team has five water bottles that can be spent to move a rider an extra space (cost of one bottle on the flat, 2 bottles in mountains).  The rider furthest across the finish line at the end of a turn is the winner.

The Senior version introduces different categories of climb and gives each team member a role (climber, sprinter, rouleur, domestique (flat or mountain), and lantern rouge).  Each role has particular abilities.  Each team may launch one attack by rolling four dice instead of the normal two.  Falls, fast descents and falling back to join a team-mate are also represented.

The Master version makes use of software accessed through the publishers website to enable whole tours to be run.

From the game's introduction:

Hue was the site of the January, 1968 battle between the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and its guerrilla allies, the Viet Cong (VC), against the 1st Division of the Army of the Republic of South Viet Nam (ARVN) and, the best combat troops in the area, elements of the United States Marine Corps (USMC). Vietnamese General Giap directed his communist troops in a concerted attack during Tet (the lunar New Year), successfully overrunning [sic] Hue and starting a bloody battle to retake the city.

The battle for Hue was unique, in that it was a medieval city being attacked with modern weapons. The moats and walls presented new sets of tactical problems. The battle was a combination of World War II street fighting and medieval siege warfare, with almost all participants carrying [sic] a fully automatic weapon. If the rules seem peculiar at times, remember that it was a very peculiar battle.

As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators Schwarze Kapelle, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?

Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing an historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).

But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.

On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions  at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling Conspire action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.

After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.

To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator  fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of Target symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any Eagles rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.

Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of it's cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.

9504,Corteo,1979,6.97143,56,3,2,8,120,120,Wargames,Political Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Corteo is a simulation of a demonstration in a city. A huge mass of people goes across it trying to occupy the most important spots: from embassies to the TV Station, from the government palace to the court, from the prison to the most fashionable shops.

Counters have traditional movement and combat scores. The Demonstration player has a lot of slow units plus some quicker and deadlier ones (from anarchists to marxist-leninists); the Power player has policemen and Carabinieri with heavy vehicles (some of them shooting gas) plus a few lousy city council policemen.

The huge city is finely depicted (graphics by Piergiorgio Maoloni, that later became one of the best well-known art directors of Italian newspapers and magazines) and it has funny names on streets and squares. A hex grid is of course impressed on it to rule movement and combat. A humorous Yellow Pages booklet is included to help finding the best places to score points around.

There are several scenarios, including a totally different Black Out scenario inspired by a New York black-out: up to 6 players go around sacking the city, while up to two players try to stop them with policemen and Carabinieri. Those two can fight each other to get the goods they seized to the pillagers, but only if it is a dark turn so they can pretend not to recognize each other.

This is the first boardgame published by C.UnS.A. when they were still Comitato Un Sacco Alternativo, before becoming a company and a successful team of game designer (for boardgames, radio and TV games, advertising games, training games, magazine games and so on). At that time, C.UnS.A. was composed by Massimo Casa, Giulio De Petra, Alvaro Lojacono, Piergiorgio Maoloni and Sergio Zoffoli.

In 1980 Mondadori Giochi made a second edition with a heavier map and counters, but without the Black Out variant: there was rumor that it could become a separate game, but this never happened.

For each expedition, players have to plan the amount of oxygen they want to share, the depth they want to dive to, and the duration they will spend scavenging for treasure. The deeper the player dives, the more treasure the player can scavenge, but the more perilous the expedition. As each player descends into the dark murky waters, they will have to watch out for nasty sharks, earthquakes and worst of all, the other Divers!

D3 puts a new twist on push-your-luck games, because like a co-op game, your planning and actions determine each others' success, but unlike a co-op game, all players scheme to get more treasure than the rest. This coupled with the very interactive Event Cards will create an engaging playing atmosphere that will keep everyone on their toes. It has shown to be a good game for families, girlfriends and wives.

As the dive unfolds and the oxygen drains away with every gasping breath, will you remain as just another Lara Croft wannabe, or will you return with rich sunken treasures and maybe even the fabled Lost Jewel of Zakarra? It is all in your hands, or fins.

After the success of City and Guilds, Steve's new game Kings Progress was inevitable. This game is based upon the typical life of a late medieval English court. Many Kings came under the influence of a select inner group of courtiers who used their influence to gain gifts of land, titles, money etc.

This game recreates the desperate race to get the best and the most gifts for yourself. The game is played over three rounds; each round the King visits a royal castle or house (The Kings Progress). Your aim is to gain the most prestige for your family by collecting courtier cards, melding them to build your influence and thus gain control of the courtiers, advancing those courtiers to the royal castle and then using the courtiers to select various gifts for yourself. Gifts and courtier control gain victory points at the end of each round. As the game progresses gifts become more valuable. Each courtier also has a character ability which can be used by the player in control to gain extra actions or other advantages.

Brute Force highlights three pivotal campaigns from the West Front: 

    Norway,

In each, both commanders are faced with numerous operational decisions. Proper allocation of the limited air and naval support is just as important as deciding manpower assignments. Both sides have opportunities to make numerous decisions affecting the outcome of the campaign. For the Allied commander, deciding where and when to commit the small but powerful BEF in 1940 is a choice as difficult as that facing the Axis commander concerning his limited panzer forces in 1944.

Units are Corps, Divisions, and Brigades. One hex equals 30 miles. One turn is about 2 weeks.

Can the British and commonwealth prisoners escape? Only one of them? None?

During the game, players have to play cards in order to make the tunnel or play the action on the card in order to know who's who. In turn order, the active player has to play a card (if possible) and pass the turn until all the cards of the game are played. There are two ways to play cards:

1) FACE DOWN: Place a tunnel card in the center of the table to complete the word SCAPE. If another card with same letter has already been played this way, you have to play it on top.

2) FACE UP: Play the action indicated on the card, then discard it, showing the letter and identity of the card.
 Finish your turn by drawing until you have four cards (if able), then the player on your right becomes active.

When all the cards have been played, the first card of each tunnel pile is revealed. If the SCAPE word is not complete, the SS player wins the game. If there is any card with the SS identity revealed in any heap, the SS player wins; otherwise, the team (RAF/USAF) with most heaps with its affiliation wins the game.

The villains are captured by way of die rolls.  Each girl has an identical die, so the more of the girls you have present to combat a villain, the better your odds of capture.  ...of course, the better your odds of getting some of them knocked out for the rest of the turn.  Since everyone shares the girls, having the earliest time card, and getting the girls knocked out will impact everyone.

In an atmosphere of pessimism and charged paranoia, the citizens of Salem are at the mercy of demons  not demons of the soul, but demons of the mind. What began as a devout Puritan community devolved in a matter of months into a people torn apart by fear, lies, and fanatical orthodoxy. The residents of Salem quickly discovered that they could find Hell all around them.

Salem incites the atmosphere of paranoia that held the village of Salem captive. Players act with the assumption that there are witches among them (and, in this case, there will be). Each player controls six residents of Salem, three of whom are witches. Game play is simple: try to rid the village of witches and keep the identities of your own residents secret.

The game plays over the course of four rounds representing the four months (JuneSeptember 1692) in which the hysteria was at its height. Each round has two parts: a Witch Hunt and a Witch Trial, followed by hangings (the dates of which correspond to the four actual hangings that took place in Salem that year). During the Witch Hunt, players send residents to jail and provide alibis for their own jailed citizens. At the end of each round all jailed citizens stand trial. Players then collectively decide who is hanged and who is spared. The player who is most successful at discerning witches from villagers wins!

While the story surrounding the Salem witch trials has become something of a legend, every character in this game is based on a real person whose life was directly touched and in some cases torn apart or taken away by the events surrounding the Salem witch trials. Extensive research has been done to craft the real-life stories of all 42 residents in the game.

While this game focuses on the people and events specific to Salem, Massachusetts, similar witch hunts were taking place as far north as Maine and as far West as Connecticut. Surely, the devil had come to New England.

The game takes place in Britain, around the 9th century. Each player represents one people fighting for occupying space and developing their civilization.

To gain victory points you must build temples and cities. For that, it is necessary to generate resources that come from the conquest of new territories and from the founding of new cities. And to conquer new territories you must also build troops and buy cards.

The troops move through the territories and also by ship, which gives them more mobility. The battles are fought with dice, affected by cards played with the face down and revealed at the same time. The presence of a leader also affects the result.

The end of each round is marked by a Viking attack, the Vikings being the most feared warriors of that time and of the game. After that, there comes the scoring and each player receives victory points markers that he hides from the other players.

At the end of 8 rounds, the player with more points wins the game.

The challenge is to balance economic and military development, aiming at gaining the most victory points.

From the instructions:
For 2 to 5 players ages 9 and up.

You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity.

During day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, youll try to keep it warm.

Upon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).

Your goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough). Survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.

TWOM The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from the electronic version of the game 
and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices.

The boardgame significantly broadens the original games universe and emphasises the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.

The project aims to omit the usual boardgame threshold - TWOM the board game is an INSTANT PLAY game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.

Experience the simulation of a struggle for survival as a group of civilians facing a blind and merciless war.

In war, not everyone is a soldier.

Some proposals lead to love and happiness and some to financial prosperity, but some are nothing more than shallow seductions. Whatever happens, you must ensure that your characters come out on top!

When proposing, if a Gentleman's Charm is lower than the Lady's, he must discard cards to make up the difference. If he wants to really impress her, he can discard additional cards to boost his Charm. If the Lady accepts, the players exchange characters and whoever has the higher Wealth draws cards equal to the difference. If she declines - paying cards if necessary to counter his Charm offensive - the Gentleman returns to the player's hand to brush up on his manners.

Declining a proposal from a Gentleman with a higher Rank will earn you additional cards, and if you have more Ladies in Society than anyone else at the start of your turn, you get an extra 'go'. This can help you to dominate the matchmaking scene but will doubtless draw the ire of your rivals. It's good to be protective of your Ladies, but don't let them get left on the shelf...

When the deck runs out, the game ends and players tally up the Virtue of their married characters, then subtract the Virtue of their 'old maids' (Ladies left unwed in Society). Whoever has the highest Virtue total wins!

If you stop you can take a safe card on which all code numbers are covered by markers.

There are two identical maps, one for each player each hidden from the other.  Hexes are 10km, each turn 3 days, counters are from regiments to divisions.  Each turn consists of multiple movement and combat phases for each player.  Movement into enemy territory is done by stating the hex you wish to enter.  The opposing player must state if he has a unit in that hex, if not movement succeeds and may continue.  If so, an attack may take place if desired, and may involve multiple units on both sides with the attacker coming from one or more hexes.  Units are only revealed during combat.  Combat losses are in steps (7-8 becomes 5-8, then 3-8, then 1-8, then elim, etc) and determined by dice on a CRT.  Supply, fortifications and air power rules are included.  Victory is determined per scenario and is based on liberating cities or for exiting the west edge of the map.

Ah, but these Curses are fun, not malicious, something along the lines of You can't bend your elbows or You must declare eternal love to anyone who rings the bell during this game.

After that, each turn in Curses! the active player takes two actions in this order:


    Draw a Challenge card. This card presents you with an action you must perform  a role to act out, a story to tell, an opinion to explain.
    Draw a Curse card and give it to another player. You, bark like a dog whenever the player on your right reads a card!


So where's the game? You must obey the Curses placed upon you at all times  and if someone notices that you're not barking or declaring eternal love or doing whatever else it is you're supposed to be doing, then that player rings the central bell and reveals you for a louse and a nogoodnik. As a penalty, you must turn the Curse card you violated face down. And while you might think that lifting a Curse is good, break three Curses and you're out of the game.

It addresses former Midgard RPG players, who don't find the time for role playing anymore, as well as fans of fantasy boardgames. As the complexity level is rather high and the game offers multiple options for players, Midgard is rather successful in achieving it's goal. The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.

The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.

Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.

Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too. The goal of the game is to get 3 treasure rewards, rise to character level 3 and find 2 artifacts first. If you deliver the treasures and artifacts to the correct city you have won the game.

Included are pre-generated characters like Sorcerer or Warrior but players will be able to create their own characters in the final release version.

     Some of the spaces are holes.  The first piece to land on a hole is lost from play, but it also fills the hole.  It is flipped to its other side, which is colored as a regular (safe) space.
     A piece scores more points the later it arrives at the finish, so it behooves the player to delay for as long as feasible.  Pieces that don't finish score nothing, though, so the waiting game must be judged carefully.

In the 2 player version, one player controls the Spartans and the other player controls the Persians. In the 3 player game, 2 players compete for the most Glory as the Spartans, and in a 4 player game, 2 players also compete as the Persians for the most Spartan kills.

At the start of the game, the battle forces (represented by round cardboard Units) are already lined up and ready to fight at the border of the Hot Gates. Each time a Persian Unit dies, the Spartans score Glory Points on the Glory Track that surrounds the board. Spartan Units die permanently, while most defeated Persian Units can enter the game again as reinforcements.

The Object of the Game for the Spartans is to score 100 Glory (or 50 Glory if there are 2 Spartan players). The Object of the Game for the Persians is to wipe out the Spartans before they can achieve their Glory, or to delay the Spartans long enough for Ephialtes to reach the end of the Goat Path (6 rounds of play). If there are 2 Persian Players, then the player with the most Spartan kills wins this game.

The game uses cards and dice to simulate the action from the film. Spartan Heroes include Leonidas, Stelios, the Captain, Dilios, and Astinos. Persian Leaders include Xerxes, the Uber Immortal, and the Persian Generals. Each card simulates the action associated with a quote from the film, such as I Would Gladly Kill My Own Men For Victory (Persian) and Tonight We Dine In Hell! (Spartan).

The game plays quickly (20 - 30 minutes), and is meant to be a fast diversion with a good share of both tactics and luck.

69587,Get Nuts,2011,5.97191,178,1.6667,3,6,30,45,,Animals Card Game Humor ,Action Point Allowance SystemHand Management,"Get Nuts is a fast-playing tactical card game for 3-6 players that puts you in the role of a determined squirrel, trying to get hold of a stack of nuts to get through the cold winter. But other enemy rodents will do anything they can to stop you from climbing that tree and snatching those precious snacks.

To claim a nut card in Get Nuts, a player must move his squirrel down a trail composed of four cards in order to reach the nut stash in the center of the table. Squirrels don't just saunter down shady paths, however, so you need to play tree cards on the path to give the squirrel a way to navigate toward the nuts. On a turn, a player has four action points available, with which he can play cards from his hand (which cost 0-4 points) or advance his squirrel down the trees on his trail, with each space costing a point. At the end of a player's turn, he can discard any number of cards he wants, then refill his hand to five cards.

Cards can either help you or attack opponents. Use a sacred tree to provide a safe haven that others can't destroy, and place the Divine Nut on your path, a special treat that can be claimed only after taking a nut from the stash. Take chainsaws and flamethrowers to opponents' trees, or send a bullzoer up their trail to demolish trees one by one over several turns. If your squirrel sits in a tree that's felled, it moves back down the trail and will remain injured until you take the time to administer first aid and get the little guy up and running once again.

If you claim a nut, your squirrel scampers back to the start of the trail, and you must remove trees from your trail equal to the value of that nut. (Trees wither from loneliness when they lose their nuts.) The game ends once the last nut card has been claimed, and the player with the most valuable stash wins.

Cross-Country Demolition Racing in the 21st Century (or Armored Leapfrog as its adherents refer to it) brings visions of Mad Max in all his infinite glory to your tabletop in an easily played card game format. Each player competes in an armored racer equipped with an assortment of accessories not commonly found in your average Auto Parts store. Road hog won't let you pass? No problem debate the right of way with a burst of your front machine-guns. Annoyed by that tailgater? a few well-timed grenades should scrape him off your bumper. Reckless passer? well, if your smoke screen doesnt discourage him, a nudge from your scythe-blade hubcaps should do the job. And these are just the standard accessories. In the Advanced Game, you can customize your car into something even James Bond would envy.

Running low on fuel  better pull into the next Rest Stop, but beware of sabotage or theft. Only losers nap during RoadKill. Besides, what better time to salt the track with tire spikes or change a road sign or two. Everything goes in Roadkill, an uproarious game of highway combat more vicious than the Santa Monica Freeway.

Players vie for the lead so they may lay the next section of the course. For example, a player with a Nuclear Fuel Cell will want to lead the others on a merry chase through mountainous terrain to sap their fuel. However, someone already running on fumes will opt for a desert straight-away to finish the race before he must pit and relinquish the lead. But pole position has its price - attracting more than its share of misfortune, while slipstreaming provides opportunities back in the pack.

As if the players don't heap enough mayhem upon each other, the game throws an endless series of monkey wrenches into play as cars breakdown, the road widens and narrows or comes to a temporary stop in a blizzard, rock slide, or drawbridge (or does it?). You never know what is around the bend in Roadkill.

This game, released by Fabryka Gier Historycznych (Historical Games Factory)in cooperation with Fundacja Niepodległości (Foundation for Independence), takes place throughout the entirety of World War II, with the players taking the roles of commanders of the Polish forces that are fighting on numerous fronts: Eastern and Western Europe, Africa, etc. By allocating their troops in different regions of the world, they aim to carry out missions (including the most famous battles of WW2) and earn victory points (VPs). The players do not own or control the soldiers, which are represented by neutral cards, moved by the players around the board, and activated only when it is the time to play a mission card in a given region; that said, their particular specialization may increase a player's chance to win a mission. The player with the most VPs at the end of the War (May 1945) wins.

The game presents true historical characters, events and places. First to Fight shows the scale of various activities that took place during the war  but it is not a wargame. Over its 40-70 minute playing time, a player will get to know many people and places that played an important role in achieving the victory over Germany. Among the soldiers to command, you can find Antoni Chruściel ps. Monter, August Emil Fieldorf ps. Nil, Jan Kozielewski ps. Jan Karski, Zdzisław Jeziorański ps. Jan Nowak, Stanisław Maczek ps. Baca, Jan Piwnik ps. Ponury, Zofia Rapp-Kochańska ps. Marie Springer, Stanisław Skalski, Elżbieta Zawacka ps. Zo, Witold Urbanowicz ps. Kobra. In order to win the game, you will have to train your soldiers and send them to various fronts  from the cold regions of Northern Europe, through the sun-baked deserts of Northern Africa and peaceful (only in theory!) Western Europe, to Warsaw, always fighting to the last bullet and the last soldier! All characters and events presented in the game were real.

Iwo Jima was a critical point on the flight path of US bombers from their Saipan bases to their Japanese targets. The island would be a refuge for malfunctioning or damaged bombers coming or going. An obvious target for a US amphibious assault, the Japanese had reinforced the garrison and dug miles of tunnels the length and breadth of the island. Their goal was to inflict maximum casualties on the Americans to force them to reconsider the seemingly inevitable invasion of Japan. The resulting battle was brutal, even by the standards of the Pacific War.

Pilots are represented by ratings which are embarked on the aircraft when launched.  The carriers move with a special die which gives each carrier a 50-50 chance of either moving forward one or turning 60 degrees.  The aircraft move with a normal d6.  If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.

An amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.

The game Koplopers en Dwarsliggers puts the players in charge of their own railway company. These companies may use all railway tracks in the Netherlands. Their only goal is to transport as many passengers as possible to their intended destinations. For these passengers the journey from Rotterdam to Amsterdam may well go via Eindhoven.

Sometimes there is a sudden change of direction when the train has picked up more passengers, and a majority of those want to go to another part of the country. At other times trains may well skip stations when no passengers need to be there. And when a train does call at a station the passengers enter quickly hoping that they will arrive at their destination today. Is your train the one to be in? How many times they must change trains in order to arrive at their destination? Or will they not make it at all, because of those annoying obstructions?

Introduction to the game
In Koplopers en Dwarsliggers every player may construct up to three trains and each of those trains can transport up to 500 passengers. During the game you pick up passengers at stations and put their tokens at your train organizer card in the corresponding box. And then you try to transport your passengers to their destinations, after which you collect their tokens in your tray. Each turn you may spend five action points that you can use for constructing or scrapping trains, but you may also combine trains, split them up again, or reverse them. You can pick up passengers, transport them or have them change trains, and finally you can play obstruction cards or perform an emergency repair. The player who has brought the highest number of passengers to their destination wins the game.

Some interesting facts

        Koploper is a Dutch train type (see game box), but it also means front runner. The railway meaning of dwarsligger is sleeper, but it also is Dutch for an obstructive person;
        The game board is based on the actual railway lay-out in the Netherlands;
        The abbreviations used to denote stations are the official abbreviations used by the Dutch railway companies;
        The designer of the game works for Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the main passenger railway company in the Netherlands.

But don't be too quick to roll for the highest value because Alea iacta est; the dice might no longer form a valid Roman numeral. What's more, the results you roll must be placed in ascending order on the scoresheet.

In Rmisch Pokern, each player gets six action cards. On your turn, you first roll a die. After each roll, you must decide whether to stop or to continue by rolling an additional die. You may continue to roll as long as your results can still form a Roman numeral. If you end your turn with a valid number, this number is noted in your column of the scoresheet. You can decide in which of the seven rows the number gets written. The only restrictions are that the numbers must be in ascending order from top to bottom, and you cannot repeat a number.

If you rolled an invalid number, or the number is already in your column of the scoresheet, your turn ends. All is not lost, though! You can still use your action cards to turn a bad roll into a good one; however, you must make this choice carefully because each action card still unused at the end of the game provides bonus points! The game ends when someone has seven numbers in their column of the scoresheet, and the player with the most points wins.

173770,Swamped,2016,6.42889,90,1.75,2,4,15,30,,Card Game Exploration ,Action / Movement Programming,"Swamped is a semi-cooperative game of adventure, peril and treasure in which players move through a swamp searching for a rare herb that can cure diseases. Each player takes a turn steering the boat to find the herb. But the swamp has many other treasures as well, so players may try to steer the boat away from its intended goal to increase their own wealth.

Swamped is a game for 2-4 adventurers that plays in about 30 minutes and expands the vibrant world of Antidote. In addition to a one-of-a-kind theme, there are five core elements that make Swamped incredibly fun and a surprisingly unique gaming experience:

1. Player-shared pieces: All players share ownership of the same tiny boat in the swamp, so the actions of any one player impact every other player directly.

2. Secret and shared objectives: Everyone knows the main objective, but each player also has a hidden goal that might lead the whole expedition into deadly peril!

3. Player controlled game-length: Players can speed-up or slow-down the game down depending on their preference. Some will try to get out of the swamp quickly, while others will delay until they've collected precisely the right combination of treasures.

4. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty who has won the game before each player's secret objective is revealed, leading to an exciting reveal at the very end!

5. Efficient use of physical components: Despite its small size (35 cards and two pieces), most cards have multiple uses and orientations leading to a surprisingly deep set of decisions each player can make. Furthermore, as players move deeper into the swamp, the swamp expands from the action card deck, opening up greater adventure, while at the same time triggering a built-in game timer.

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.
If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.

Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this aint no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because its full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.

At the turn of the last century, South America seemed poised to make the same economic leap as the northern half of the hemisphere. Fueled by booming exports of grain, cattle, coffee and rubber, Brazil and Argentina saw their economies grow rapidly and at one time both stood among the world's ten wealthiest nations.  All that cash led their leaders to seek the prestige symbols of the day: dreadnought battleships. Argentina, Brazil and Chile all built dreadnoughts just like the Great Powers, but none of them ever fired a shot at a foreign enemy.

Cone of Fire is a boxed game for both the Second World War at Sea and Great War at Sea series. The fleets of Argentina, Brazil and Chile plus those of Peru and Uruguay are added to both series, along with ships from Germany, France and Britain. Most of the scenarios, or game situations, are based on hypothetical situations arising from the actual war scares between the South American nations and sometimes European interlopers, and the war plans with which they addressed them.  There are also scenarios based on the actual conflicts which took place in South American waters: the hunt for Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee's German cruiser squadron in 1914, and the hunt for the cruiser that bore his name 25 years later.

Alongside the ships actually operated by the South American naval powers, there are also ships they ordered and did not receive, or contemplated but did not order. The Brazilians have several projected classes of battleships that they never completed, as well as the modern warships they sought from the U.S. Navy during World War II. Argentina and Chile have their projected battleships, carriers and cruisers as well. And there are the actual jet aircraft flown by Argentina and Brazil.

There are six maps, three at Second World War at Sea scale, and three at Great War at Sea scale. These cover the region from south of Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the Americas, to well north of Rio de Janeiro. There are huge stretches of ocean as well as the narrow, winding channels of the Chilean coast.

The game plays in rounds, and each round consists of a separate money-making deal. Each round, players play cards in clockwise order in turns to give them the right to a cut of the current deal, the value of which depends on the cards played. When a player has passed twice, he can no longer influence that round. After everyone has passed twice, the round ends, and points are totalled to calculate the value of that deal. Players then earn money for each cut or piece of the action that they have, which represents their share of that deal. While playing cards, players can negotiate in order to encourage other players to make plays that are favorable to them.

After a fixed number of such deals (rounds), the game ends, and the player who has the most money wins.

An Axis attack was met by a furious Allied counter-attack which then developed into a grinding battle of attrition and maneuver that finally ended in massive Axis victory.

Alternating random activation by formation provides player with uncertainty and high re-playability as no two games will be alike. Each turn player receive a varying number of activations to represent the supply levels, command confusion, fatigue and intelligence of their armies and this leads to an ebb and flow to the battle as each side is dominant at different times. After units move, strengths are educed to simulate fatigue and lack of defensive preparation making counter-attacking key to the game. Minefields, airpower, anti-tank abilities and the armor versus infantry conflict are all modeled in a simple and effective set of rules.

There are two scenarios with a playing time of 3-7 hours.

131568,Codinca,2012,6.55802,81,1.25,2,4,30,30,,Abstract Strategy ,Tile Placement,"Deep within the rain forests of the Yucatan, rival teams of treasure hunters have recently discovered the lost city of Codinca. In the center of the once great citadel stands a stone temple. Local legends tell of great treasures that lie buried beneath the temple, but despite many weeks of searching no doorway has been found.

On the top of the temple stands a square stone altar. A small totem stands in the center of this, surrounded by a pattern of sixteen carved tiles. Examining them closely you discover an intricate series of mechanisms which allow the tiles to switch places and turn over, which reveals that each tile has a stone side and a gold side. Carvings on each side of the pillar indicate that a sequence of four key patterns must be made with the tiles to open the temple. Can you be the first to unlock the secrets of Codinca?

In Codinca, each player has control of a set of four matching symbol tiles: Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Players take turns attempting to move their tiles into a series of four specific key patterns indicated on the key discs drawn at the beginning of the game; those patterns are a block of four, a line of four, four corners (can be four corners of any nine tiles as well as outside corners) and a diagonal line of four.

On each turn a player must either switch and flip one of their own tiles with any adjacent tile, or switch one of their tiles with any adjacent tile and switch the same or another of their tiles with any adjacent tiles or flip two tiles, one of which must be one of their own tiles. In addition, players are allocated three Spirit Card that gives them the bonus move choice of Line Push or Rotate Four. This allows players to disguise their planned moves. On the back of the Spirt Card is a Trap Pattern. This can be used to change a set display of tiles from gold to stone and visa versa to match the pattern on the Trap Pattern. Players can match their required patterns in any order, and the first player to match all patterns wins.

In 1477, the French king Louis XI created the royal mail service. Within a century it evolved into a complex postal and merchandise delivery system.

The main stream of commerce and information flowed through the Loire Valley, located in Central France and the middle stretch of the Loire River. It was a period of development and wealth for the villages and cities that bordered this body of water.

Who will become the richest merchant or messenger in the France of the 15th century? Who will cover all the streets along the Loire Valley? Who will build the richest palace, the more prosperous abbey? Who will have at his service the mightier personalities?

Your objective is to be recognized as the most prestigious monarch by producing the most admired art and culture, lead the continent in scientific innovations, spread or resist the spread of Catholicism, and attempt military expansion beyond your historical borders. All of this is accomplished by marshaling 134 historical luminaries  important historical figures covering every relevant domain of human achievement during the period.

Additionally, each luminary has a unique Action, Enhancement, or Response based on their real historical achievements to be brought to bear in service of your nation.

Consider the difference between Rembrandt and Vermeer: Both are important and wonderful artists, but in the real-life Dutch Republic, Rembrandt was famous and well-patronized, composing hundreds of celebrated portraits in his career. Vermeer was obscure and produced an order of magnitude less art in his career. In Road to Enlightenment, Rembrandt has higher ratings and gives you a benefit every single time another luminary is removed from the game, reflecting the influence and nature of his portraiture. On the other hand, Vermeer provides only a modest benefit to reflect the limited impact his career had at the time.

Invading other countries in the 17th century was a complex mix of cultural, religious, and logistical considerations. These have all been baked into the various territories on the map, making it quick and easy to make decisions around where to try to attack:


     You can attempt to invade only those territories that have your nation's colour on the top of the circle. Those are the only nations that could have even possibly successfully invaded that territory in real-life.



     The number associated with each nation's colour indicates how difficult it would be to successfully conquer. In the case of London, it is very difficult for Spain, France, or Sweden to conquer it.



     The religious symbol in the lower left corner lets the player know whether the territory is primarily Catholic, primarily Anti-Catholic (Protestant, Russian Orthodox, and other Christian branches), or primarily Islamic. If it is successfully invaded by a nation with a different religious affiliation, it has an impact on the continental struggle between religions.



     The lines connecting into London, and the anchor with an A in the lower right corner, indicate which territories need to be held by a player before they have access to attack. The anchor with an A indicates that any player who already owns another Atlantic port territory is connected and could choose to attack over the water.


With Road to Enlightenment, all of the intricacies related to managing military expansion have been baked into these easy-to-use board mechanisms.

In order to create a game that simulates the battle between nations for prestige  covering war, politics, religion, science, and art  while focusing on many of the diverse people of history, we've mashed up aspects from wargames, Euro games, deck-building games, and statistical sports simulations. While it is an eclectic mix, this broad spectrum approach to the game's design enabled this diverse and richly detailed set of conditions to come together in a game that is epic in scale but doesn't take all day to play.

The full game is for 3-7 players; the pocket version is for 2-4.

Warzone Resurrection is a fast paced, exciting and tactical miniature game created by Prodos Games Ltd. and Paraodox Entertainment.

The Warzone Resurrection project brings the tabletop game well and truly into the 21st century. Lovingly, we have taken essence and best bits from the game, art and prose of previous editions to produce all new miniatures, a background re-imagining (by Warzone mega-fan and writing genius, Andy Hoare) and an exciting innovative gaming system.

The gaming system involves both miniatures and cards. The minis are your skirmish force and the cards represent game resources, additional wargear, global and local effects on the battlefield etc.. In a real battle it is likely that a soldier wouldn't know his opponents wargear, whether they have grenades or a laser-sight for example. Both sides might be surprised by a Martian earthquake or Mercurian solar flare. The Venusian jungle cover you are in might be better (or worse) than you thought! War is rarely predictable, especially when it takes place on the planets, planetoids and asteroids of the solar system! All these and many more variables are represented by the cards you and your opponent play. Making Warzone Resurrection a truly novel, realistic and exciting tabletop miniature skirmish game!

The game brings 7 factions among the Bauhaus, Capital, Cybertronic, Mishima, Imperial, The Brotherhood and the Dark Legion

The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.

The French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.

The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.
At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.

By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, altering the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.

Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French. No one suspected that on such decisions hinged the last moments of glory for Napoleon and his Grande Armee.

Between the islands are fish to move in one direction (to the fish's mouth). One side of a fish shows the player's color (only this player may move) the other no color (any player may move). After every move the fish is turned to the other color.

The gods help the player who gives the most fruit; to move (turn direction or color of a fish), to steal (of course from another player), to determine a volcanic eruption (the players near the volcanic eruption lose a turn) or to pick up better fruit.

The rules are developed from the theme (character of Hawaiian gods, building small stone temples), but it's not historical. The theme and design is similar to Kahuna / Arabana-Ikibiti, but it is more for gamers than for families, and does not require the building of connections.

Confusingly, Tilsit re-named another game by Günter Cornett with a similar island-theme Kanaloa in 2003, but it is different, and more closely related to Kahuna.

Nations in Arms brings one of the most famous periods in history to your gaming table: the French Revolution and the legend of Napoleon in Europe, from 1792 to 1815. This epic treatment of the Napoleonic period covers 24 years of warfare at the strategic level.

Nations in Arms uses a extensively updated, modified and streamlined version of the Le Grand Empire game system from Pratzen Editions (that game covered the 1800-1815 time period). The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer François-Stanislas Thomas.

Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game. Players are challenged with strategically managing their annual national production, diplomacy, and most importantly, war.

The game systems emphasize the military importance of lines of communication, the command and control ability of skilled leaders, quality of troops above quantity, and the impact of battle, epic sieges and attrition on a nation. You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.

Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns. A Chit Activation system is used to recreate the chaos of war, and events occur using an Historical Event card deck. This combination of variable chit pull and card play ensures a high replay value of the ten (10) scenarios. Nations in Arms features a one-turn tutorial scenario , four epic campaign scenarios, and five smaller scenarios.

Now its your turn to either fan the flames of The French Revolution throughout Europe, or to preserve the Old Order

The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.

Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.

Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.

Theomachy lets you take the place of a high god  lord of a group of devoted followers. Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.

Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.

The game is quick to play  typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)

Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.

Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.

Use your gods power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more. Even the Lovecraft pantheons have myth cards and their own dark miracles. Place Wilbur Whateley in the forefront of your fight, or wield the Pallid Mask!

2236,Streets of Stalingrad,1979,7.31889,45,4.5714,2,2,180,180,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"The game models the fight for the city of Stalingrad, September-October, 1942, at the company level. It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.

The most luscious wargame ever produced (OK no more editorializing). This game has possibly sunk more companies than Hasbro. The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.

The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is the designers used the actual designators used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.

The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.

There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.

There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.

The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.

74311,The Hardest Days,2011,7.53438,32,2.5,1,1,240,240,,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"The Hardest Days, designed by John Butterfield, is a purpose-designed solitaire wargame of intermediate complexity covering five critical days in the Battle of Britain, the five days that saw the heaviest air action in the sky over England in the summer of 1940. Each of those days is presented as its own scenario. THD puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to air raids launched by the Luftwaffe, which is controlled by the game system.

Each one-day scenario represents up to 14 hours during which the Luftwaffe launches raids against targets in southern England, defended by the squadrons of RAF Fighter Command. German raids include bomber Gruppen (groups), attempting to hit specific targets, and fighter groups protecting those bombers and attacking British fighter squadrons. The German goal is twofold: inflict damage on targets and destroy squadrons to gain air superiority in preparation for the invasion of England.

The game system controls German strategy and tactics. You use your fighter squadrons to respond to the raids in an attempt to destroy or turn back the raiders and prevent their effective bombing of their targets, while minimizing your own fighter losses. Your fighter squadrons and German fighter groups may participate in several raids in a given day, while German bombers, flying from distant bases, participate in only one raid per day. To track the passage of time, as measured by the sequencing of raids and the turnaround of squadrons and groups during each Raid Day, the action is divided into seven two-hour time segments, from 0600 to 1800 hours, inclusive.

One inch on the area map equals 10 miles. British squadrons are composed of 10 to 15 aircraft. German groups possess 20 to 30 aircraft.  Each time segment represents two hours. Each Air Action Phase represents 10 minutes. The turn sequence is as follows.

I. Raid Approach Phase
 1. Raid Region Determination
 2. RAF Patrol
 3. Raid Effort  Coast Crossing
 4. British Detection
II. Air Action Phase
 1. Interception  Combat
 2. Targeting  Bombing

III. Airfield Operations Phase

36612,Great War at Sea: Pacific Crossroads,2010,7.2461,41,2.5,2,2,30,30,Wargames,Nautical Wargame World War I ,Hex-and-Counter,"During the first half of the 20th century, the United States and the Japanese Empire constantly made plans for a naval war against the other rising power. Each believed that the U.S. Navy would fight its way across the Pacific Ocean, with important clashes taking places in island chains like the Marianas and the Carolines.

Pacific Crossroads is the new introductory boxed game for the Great War at Sea series. It's based on the actual plans of both the United States and Japan for naval conflict at the close of World War I and immediately afterwards. Players try to seize and hold bases to either enable or stop the American drive across the Pacific.

While the game is intended for new players, there's plenty here for old salts, too. New ships like the American 1910 battle cruiser design are present, as are the battle cruisers the Americans feared Japan would acquire from the Royal Navy. There's a lot of naval warfare in this small package, which also ushers in a new edition of the series rules.

The 22x17-inch operational map covers waters around the Mariana and Caroline Islands and the coast of northern New Guinea. Players maneuver their fleets on this map and search for one another with aircraft, submarines and surface ships. When contact is made, player moves to the tactical map.

The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ships capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.

A new count has been given dominion over the settlement of Blankenburg. People are coming to the town from the surrounding countryside in hopes of a better life. You have seen an opportunity to make your fame and fortune as the town is built.

In Builders of Blankenburg you are competing to construct the town and earn the most prestige while doing so. Each player takes on a persona which provides a unique benefit during the game. You begin the game with some basic resources and a small amount of silver. While all structures can earn you prestige, only building what the town's citizens demand will earn you the silver necessary to bid for and purchase more resources. Each turn consists of four phases:


    Bidding (the primary means of gaining resources)
    Building (constructing and occasionally demolishing)
    Income (gaining silver for the structures you own)
    Marketplace (an opportunity to buy plans and resources)


The game introduces the citizen track, a growing group of town folk that allows all players to see which structures will earn them income. It also serves to signal the end of the game once the town is full. The town is split into four districts, each limited in size and awarding bonuses at the end of the game for anyone who controls more of a district than their opponents. If there are no other plots on which to build, the game also ends. Beware, while the citizens are known, the best laid plans can be ruined by events and visitors to the town. The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game is declared the winner.

If too many bombs try to leave at once, though, the armory guards could force them back to work.

In game terms, each round you reveal a guard card that shows a number for each of the five colors of bombs in the game. Players have a hand of bomb cards, and they first simultaneously reveal one card, then they simultaneously reveal two cards. After this, players now compare the sum for each color of bombs played. If the sum is equal to or lower than the guard's value, then whoever played the highest block of this color earns points equal to the value of the cards played and everyone else scores one point per card of this color; if the sum surpasses the guard's total, then the player with the highest sum throws away his cards of this color, then you recheck the sum. After checking each color, you reveal a new guard, then continue play.

The game ends when at least one player has played a certain number of cards from his hand, at which point the player with the most points wins.

A total of 1400 counters represent various units and game effects. Game turns represent the passage of a week of real-world time, with cycles intervening during which players carry out such routines as production, blockade, construction, politics, etc. Each game turn is divided into two player turns, during which one player or the other may move his ground and naval combat units on the map and attack his opponent.

The game can be played as a huge campaign using all three maps and simulating the entire war from beginning to end. That requires hundreds of man-hours.

During the game, the players have a team of heroes with which they will fight against an ever increasing amount of powerful enemies. As a general rule, the game has a duration of five rounds, with one wave per player each round. Each wave is divided in four phases:

1. Lord Morth's phase: The starting player rolls the enemy dice into the portal board to determine in which path the enemies enter the boards. To do this, the player rolls as many enemy dice as indicated on the turn track, and a 12-sided die to determine the exact position of the portal. Also, the players receive cards to trump their opponent's strategies.

2. Portal phase: The players may pay gold to turn the portal, modifying the initial enemy distribution. In turn order, each player may pay as much gold as they want to move the portal in any direction. Once all players have moved the portal or have passed their turn, they take the enemy dice that ended the phase in their zones of the portal board, placing them in the corresponding paths.

3. Heroes' phase: Players move and attack with their team of characters, trying to eliminate all threats from their boards.

4. Assault phase: Enemies advance, trying to exit the player's boards. The starting player rolls a three-sided die, and each player has to add the resulting number to the initial movement value of each enemy. If an enemy escapes a player's board, the player takes damage.

Once all rounds are finished, the game ends and the player who has the fewest damage points wins!

Each round, an array of characters is laid out, with normal and mirrored images alternating.

The next player takes 1-2 cards, but if he takes two, the cards must be adjacent. From the third player on, each player takes 1-3 cards; again, you can take multiple cards only if they're adjacent.

The roles are hidden, so you don't know which players are predator or prey. Be careful not to end up on a boat with the wrong animal, or you'll end up as its lunch! Use your feral cunning to trap your prey on the same boat for a tasty treat while you cross the river. The player who scores the most points by crossing the river, eating their prey, and avoiding being eaten themselves wins!

In more detail, Ravenous River includes seven animals, with each animal (e.g., horse) having a predator (bull) and a prey (hound). At the start of each round, each player secretly receives an animal card, and they want to feed that animal and get it safely home. Shuffle seven animal cards, then place them face down in a row on the riverbank. Place two boat cards near this bank; each boat can hold at most two animals. Deal each player two action cards. On a turn, a player either:


    Places an animal: The player looks at animal card, then either places it face up on a boat or discards an action card and places it face down on the riverbank again.
    Moves an animal: The player discards an action card, then either moves an animal from a boat to the bank or from the bank to a boat.
    Plays an action card: The player discards an action card and performs that action.


If a player has no cards in hand at the end of their turn and both boats are full, players simultaneously vote on whether to end the round or not. If they do end it, players first see who eats whom on the riverbank, then who eats whom on each boat, then they unload the animals at home on the far side of the river, then again see who eats whom. Each animal scores 1 victory point (VP) for each animal eaten, unless it was eaten in turn in which case the point passes to its predator. Surviving animals score 1 VP on the bank and 2 VP at home.

If a single player has 6 or more VP, the game ends and that player wins. If no one has more than 6 VP or multiple players are tied with 6 or more VP, then the game continues for another round.

Your job is to build a network of roadways around San Andreas proper. But San Andreas is rather prone to earthquakes, which have a tendency to destroy the beautiful stretches of pavement you've been laying. After all the asphalt is put down, which road crew will end up connecting the most highway in between quakes?

In Seismic, players place hexagonal highway tiles to build long, complete sections of highways, scoring points for each tile as well as bonus points for the ending intersection tiles in their routes. Scores aren't tallied until the end of the game, because at any time, earthquakes can occur, destroying tiles along the most-built direction leading out from the central San Andreas tile. Players constantly need to be claiming as many long roadways as possible while ensuring that their highways aren't the ones that are going to be destroyed if and when an earthquake occurs.

He decided to hide them in his pyramid to prevent then from being stolen.  Unfortunately he is no longer sure where he has buried what.  With luck you will be able to help him find his treasure again. The player that finds the most of the Pharaoh's treasures and thereby collects the greatest number of search cards is the winner.

After chips have placed in the game board, pyramids placed on top and the board spun around a few times in the hopes the players wont know where treasure chips are located, the first player chooses a treasure card which assigns the number or points that the treasure will be worth would the player find it. The treasure cards have been separated into three piles marked 1, 2 and 3. Once pile 1 is exhausted, game continues with pile 2, etc. Then the player slides a pyramid into an empty space on the board. If no treasure chip is found, the player moves another pyramid. If the chip does not match his card, their turn is over. If the treasure is found, the player keeps the treasure card but the token stays where it is.

Mixed in with the treasure cards are event cards as follows:

Sandstorm: Turn the board through 180 degrees and take the next pile from the card.

Gift: Move to one of the twelve treasures.  Each player that has one or more search cards depicting this treasure must give you one of them.

Risk: Nominate two treasures that are not currently displayed on the board.  Move first to one and then to the other.  If you succeed - well done!  If you don't then you must give one of your opponents' one of your search cards.

Mirage: You draw a search card from your right hand neighbor's collection.  If you are able to move to this treasure without making a mistake then you may keep the card.  If you do not manage it then you must give your right hand neighbor one of your cards.

Desert Poker: A player of you choice must try to find a treasure that you nominate.  If he succeeds then he can take one of your search cards.  If he fails then you can take one of his.

End Game: The Pharaoh is happy because all the treasure has been found.  As soon as this (Pile 3 only) card is turned over the game ends and the players total up the points that are shown on their search cards.

After each player has found a treasure the board is rotated through 90 degrees in a chosen direction.

Once all the search cards from the second pile are used up then pile 3 is used.  In this final round all the treasures on the search cards are worth 4 points and anyone who has not yet been particularly successful can, with brains and luck, overtake all the others.

When a player finds a treasure chip that is not the one that he was looking for he is out of the game.  The remaining players continue.  Play continues until all the players are eliminated or the End Game Card is turned over.

All the players total up the points that they have showing on the search cards they have collected.  The player with the greatest number of points is the winner.

News spread around the world and the era of the 49ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.

As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as Old Dry Diggins was established. By 1849, it became known as Hangtown.  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streetsan act of swift justice, as they say.

In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangmans Tree!

The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feelsuch as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.

Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing ones own scheme and cunningly playing the players. A standout theme in the game is Boom or Bust. If a player can get out of phase for a turn, he or she will profit from a Boom yield and get bonuses, while the other players may go Bust and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork

The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.

Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.

After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a Final Shootout! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaws bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery

The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic Events feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.

Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settingsfrom light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.

The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.

Little Red Riding Hood, is the fifth entry in Purple Brain Creations' Tales  Games series. In one game mode, the players co-operate to try to reach Grandma's house before the wolf can spot them; in the second game mode, one player takes on the role of the wolf.

During the first game mode, the players will help Little Red Riding Hood reach Grandmas cottage before the wolf gets there. In this mode, the wolf is managed by the game. To start, the youngest player flips over the first card of the Path card deck. Count the number of flowers on the card. Place as many face-down Gathering tokens on it as there are flowers. This will be the first card for Gathering. Then, this player takes the first turn of the game as explained below.

In the second game mode, a player plays the wolf. Unlike the first game mode, the Wolf chooses the Path cards, instead of players drawing them randomly from the deck. The other players play as the characters helping Little Red Riding Hood reach Grandmas cottage before the Wolf arrives.

Marrakesh is an odd amalgam of backgammon and cardplay which works remarkably well. Each player sets up six pieces on their board based on the roll of six dice. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards from a special deck, and then try to collect two card tricks, using the card values to bear off the pieces. Points are awarded for bearing off pieces in various combinations, such as 2 on each of three turns, or the legendary Marrakesh itself, when all six pieces are borne off on the same turn. Defensive points are earned for keeping the opponent from removing many pieces from their board. Play continues for 12 rounds, which goes by quickly. This game is long out-of-print, but well worth it if you can find it.

What they're looking at on the table is a 6x6 grid of cards, with half the cards numbered 1-14 and the other half bearing mathematical operators. To set up the game, these cards are placed randomly checkerboard-style, with numbers and operators placed adjacent to one another.

Everyone plays simultaneously, with players trying to find a five-card formula that results in the number shown on a goal card, with goals ranging from 1 to 40. The solution must consist of orthogonally adjacent cards, though not necessarily in a straight line, and a player can't use a card twice in a formula. If a 12 is turned up as the goal, for example, one might find 8+4x1 in the grid, then shout out Got It! Players can mentally insert parentheses into a formula, so 7+2x3 can result in (7+2)x3 (=27) or 7+(2x3) (=13).

The first player to shout with a correct formula  and the grid might contain many  claims the goal card. The player who collects the most goal cards wins!

An easy version of Got It! can be set up for younger players, with a 5x5 grid that contains only the numbers 1-9 and only addition and subtraction as mathematical operators.

73361,Partizan,2011,7.2,38,2.3333,1,2,240,240,,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-CounterSimulation,"Partizan is a two-player, intermediate-complexity, historical simulation of the struggle between the Communists and the Axis occupation forces for mastery of Yugoslavia from 1941 through 1944. It starts with the first uprisings against the Axis in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro in late 1941, and ends in late 1944 just before the Soviet Army entered the country. The game is won by the Partisan player by waging an aggressive guerilla war: harassing the occupiers and destroying infrastructure that may be of use to them: warehouses, fuel dumps, bridges, dams, depots, railroads, viaducts, motor pools, etc (each represented by variably placed counters). Resource hexes represent strategic mineral deposits, such as bauxite, copper and chromium, which the Axis player must protect, along with routes from them back to Germany, while also guarding possible invasion beaches along the coast.

During the game, the exact strengths of Partisan units are mostly unknown by the Axis player (via tried and untried counter-sides). He must attempt to head off Partisan operations while never certain exactly where theyre headed. The Partisan player must select his targets carefully in order to disrupt the occupation enough for him to win the game, while avoiding becoming surrounded and destroyed by the Germans in the process.

The counter-mix includes the full German, Italian, Hungarian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Ustashi orders of battle, as well as all the Partisan forces and Marshall Tito himself (the Chetniks are handled abstractly). The Partisans may even expect support from the Anglo-Allies if the guerilla war against the Axis is going well, including possibly an amphibious invasion by the Anglo-Americans (Operation Armpit). In fact, most of the main Axis' operations in Yugoslavia historically pertained to the protection of their coastal flank. Their primary anti-partisan offensives were intended to clear the guerrillas from the coastal areas where an Allied invasion was possible. In game terms, the Allied Landing Scare rule simulates the reality of German strategic fears in the Balkans.

Axis forces, especially the Germans, are generally stronger than the partisans, but the partisans are elusive and difficult to catch, often forcing the Axis player to spread thin his forces. Partizan has been designed by Javier Romero (Triple Alliance War, Spanish Civil War) and developed by Eric Harvey (AETO, APTO  AOI). It contains one 34x22 extra-large-hex map and 228 iconic and NATO-style counters. Units of maneuver are brigades and divisions. There is one grand campaign scenario, which can be completed by two players in about five or six hours. Solitaire play is doable.

The game is set around the British 1st Infantry Division's defense of the Campoleone Salient, Anzio, 3-4 February 1944. The German counterattacks against the Anzio beachhead were some of the bloodiest of World War II. To those involved, the fighting was reminiscent to WWI trench warfare. A Raging Storm covers the first of several German attacks. The brunt of this assault fell on the British 1st Infantry Division, whose defense demonstrated the tenacity and fighting qualities of the British Soldier.

The period covered is 1936-46, and the players can make (or choose not to make) many of the decisions that led to the war.

The game is very detailed in its political aspect, and is more a political game than a wargame. Each country affected by the war is represented on an ideological chart which tracks the movement of the powers into the different spheres of influence: Fascist, Communist and Democrat.  Where each country lies on this chart is vital to which country controls their decisions and forces.  Political decisions are chosen from a large array of IPOs (International Policy Options) and a number of Political Options available only to the country that you're playing.

The game is based on the original Days of Decision (I) but is almost a new game. The old one had 4 million possible outcomes, this one has over one hundred trillion (according to the game designer).

Naps most famous Battle was fought on December 2, 1805 between the French Army under Napoleon and Russian-Austrian forces under Prince Kutusow, also known as the three- Emperor- Battle.

The game is part of the La Bataille series, designed by Monte D. Mattson and Dennis A. Spors based on the Award winning system of Larry Groves / D. Spors. This simulation is a game on battalion/ regimental scale, a true monster with nearly 1000 counters.

192802,Days of Ire: Budapest 1956,2016,7.79063,32,0,1,4,60,90,,Card Game Political Wargame ,Action Point Allowance SystemCo-operative PlayHand Management,"It's 1956, and waves of protest in Poland are once again showing cracks of the Eastern European communist bloc. Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organize a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.

One player takes charge of the Soviet forces trying to shape the headlines to his liking and uses the militia and snipers of the State Protection Authority to stop the revolutionaries at all cost. The other player(s) (from 1-3 opponents) co-operatively play as the ringleaders of the revolutionary forces collecting resources (represented as icons on their cards) and recruiting other fighters to ensure the revolution's events end up in favor of their side, while fighting off tanks and soldiers in this exciting, historically inspired card driven game.

Days of Ire: Budapest 1956 is played over seven days  the last week of October 1956. The Soviet commander plays headline cards at the beginning of every turn, gathering Command Points and triggering effects that sometimes help, sometimes hinder the revolutionary effort. This card-play, reminiscent of well-known card-driven wargames (CDG) such as Twilight Struggle or Labyrinth: War on Terror, is what drives the tempo and the strategic thrust of the game. The other player(s) form the revolutionary side. They collect cards and fighters for two reasons: to resolve events for boosts to their side, and to fight off militia, snipers, and Soviet tanks in a drastic fight for survival. They have to manage their positions while spreading across Budapest, carefully dividing their actions as a team and always keeping an eye on their morale lest they run out of cards. This team-playing aspect  reminiscent of highly successful cooperative games such as Pandemic  guarantees ease of access to players who would otherwise be more intimidated by a traditional CDG.

If any of the revolutionary ringleaders suffer too many wounds, or if they fail to resolve enough events by the end of the game, history changes and the revolution falls. But if they keep the streets of Budapest free from oppression, the revolution lives on, to fight another day.

Historical Note: In real life, the revolution succeeded, and Hungary was free for less than a week. On the 4th of November, the Soviet forces quickly recaptured the country, but that is a subject for a different game...

Middle East Campaigns covers all three Ottoman fronts (Trans-Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Palestine) plus an addition to the Serbia game extending it south to Salonika and covering the rest of the war in Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria extending Der Weltkrieg Series to the Ottoman Empire. Four maps, three counter sheets.

Five separate scenarios:

Kalfas Cephesi - Caucasus: 1914-17
The Ottoman Empire joins the Central Powers in the World War. The Turks stop a premature Russian offensive and then launch a disastrous counter invasion. Thus begin three years of fighting in the desolate Trans-Caucasus mountains.
 Sina-Filistin Cephesi: 1915-18
The Ottomans attempt to seize the Suez Canal. The British advance across the Sinai wastes to invade Palestine. Both the desert and determined Ottoman resistance impede British efforts to seize the Holy Land and threaten Turkey from the south.
 Irak Cephesi - Mesopotamia: 1914-18
The British move quickly to secure the Abadan oil fields with the Indian Army. The Indian colonial government lobbies to push further into Mesopotamia, with Baghdad as the objective. The British led forces move deep inland and encounter serious difficulty.
 Canakkale Cephesi- Gallipoli: 1915
The plan was as brilliant as it was simple. Rapidly seize the Dardenelles and place Istanbul under the guns of the Entente fleet. This simple plan proved difficult to execute. Poor planning, difficult terrain, and dogged Turkish resistance bring the amphibious invasion to a standstill. Gallipoli becomes the birthplace of Australian and New Zealand national identities, as well as that of modern Turkey.
 Makadoya Cephesi - Greece: 1915-18
Serbia's imminent collapse causes the Entente to occupy the Greek port of Salonika. Combined British, French, Serbian, and finally Greek forces fight against Bulgarians and their German and Austro-Hungarian allies on this strategically important front.

Dont forget to bring some antidote when playing Raise Your Goblets!

In Raise Your Goblets, players take the roles of nobles at a banquet, each one with their own agenda of personal vendetta. Each player has wine, poison and antidote tokens they can pour into the goblets, trying to poison their enemies while staying alive themselves! Each noble also has a special ability that allows them to bend or even break a rule.

In more detail, each character has a plastic goblet, and each goblet is primed in secret at the start of the round with either wine, poison or antidote. On a turn, you take two actions, with actions being to peek inside your goblet, rotate all goblets left or right, swap your goblet with someone else's, or secretly add one of your wine, poison or antidote tokens to any goblet. Once someone has served all of their wine, they can call a toast on their turn instead of doing anything else. Each player, including the toaster, takes one more action, then everyone drinks. If you have more poison than antidote, you die.

What's your goal in doing all of this? Well, at the start of a round you are given a target to kill, and everyone knows who is targeting whom. If at the end of a round, your target is dead, you score 1 point; if you're alive, you score 1 point; if both of these things are true, you score a bonus point (3 total). Also, whoever has the most wine in their cup scores 1 point. If someone has died, they receive a new noble card, and at the end of three rounds, whoever has scored the most points wins.

The American player has plenty of well-trained infantry at their disposal.  What they do not have in abundance is time.  The island and its vital airfields must be conquered quickly to allow the 77th Infantry Division to be transferred to Okinawa as soon as possible.  Even so the American side must achieve its mission with no more than a modest number of casualties otherwise the 77th will be in no condition to relieve the 96th Infantry Division on Okinawa as it did historically.  An economy of force approach must be adopted and assets such as air power, armor, artillery, and the American Navy all used to maximum efficiency.

The Japanese player has a mixed bag of forces ranging from regular army units to airfield construction personnel to island civilians.  Defeating the invasion at the landing beaches isnt the goal so much as making the invaders pay as high a price as possible.  With this in mind the Japanese player must focus their defense on the best terrainprimarily Mount Gusuku and the urban areas adjacent to itbut always be on the lookout for opportunities to upset the American timetable with judicious placement of machine gun nests and pockets of civilian resistance behind American lines.  The islands artillery possesses the capability to inflict attritional losses on the invaders, and the threat of a kamikaze attack on the 5th Fleet is something the American player must account for.  The arrival of night each turn opens the door for small Japanese assaults which, along with satchel charges, might produce a local victory as happened historically at Bloody Ridge, or at the very least see the American player surrendering control of the advantage marker to demand a reroll.  Changes in the weather are random, but the arrival of rain benefits the Japanese side, as does the appearance of rubble in urban areas.

An optional rule allows players to experience the uplifting presence of Ernie Pyle being close to the front and the leadership provided by Major Igawa personally joining the combat, though at the risk of seeing these historical figures killed in action.

Two variants ship with the game: Pure Skill, removes all luck from the game, and Advanced, introduces a new banana skin playing piece, adding a new twist to the game.

Monkey Dash launched at the UK Games Expo 2009, where it received the public vote for Best New Strategy Game.

745,War of Resistance,1998,6.894,50,4.5,2,2,0,0,Wargames,Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which cronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.
Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.
War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.

Game Components:

    One rules booklet.
    Two Orders of Battle booklets. One for the Japanese and one for the Chinese orders of battle.
    A Battle Scenarios Booklet
    Four full-sized maps (Maps G1 thru G4) and 2 half maps (Maps G5 and G6).
    Two map overlays

130548,Vorpals,2010,7.05109,46,2,2,5,30,30,,Card Game Fantasy ,Card DraftingHand Management,"Vorpals is a card drafting game. It is played in four rounds, with each round representing 25 years of game time. They players are princes seeking power over an island.  Over a period of 100 years, each prince will organize their army, expand their territories and fight neighbouring lords.

The goal is to accumulate more victory points than anyone else by earning the devotion of the people. There are three main ways to do this. The first is to win wars with neighbouring lords. Second, it is possible to construct buildings to produce wood and ore. The third is to use the special powers of each unit or building. You are free to choose which of these strategies to pursue, individually or in combination.

Each round is composed of the following four phases:
1.    Deployment phase: acquire a unit card by drafting and place it by paying the cost.  Units come in three basic varieties; military (e.g. veterans, knights), development (e.g. workers and farmers), and allies (e.g. dragons, goblins) 
2.    War Phase: Players make war with neighbouring players, the winner gaining victory points.
3.    Production phase: the production of income and resources, which enable buildings (e.g. treasury, barracks, castle) to be constructed.  Every building starts at level 1 and can be improved to level 2 by spending more resources.
4.    Aging phase: people and monsters die two rounds after they are deployed. So, you can feel the generations change and you must carefully plan how to maintain your forces.

Game number 9 in the Napoleonic 20 series (#1 in sub-series Germany 20)

After his disastrous defeat in Russia in 1812, followed by a halting campaign in early 1813, an armistice with the Allied Coalition is about to end. But Napoleon has been busy using this time of truce to build up his logistical base at the city of Dresden. When war resumes in August, the focal point of maneuvers centers on this French central position.

Dresden 20 presents a Deluxe Edition treatment the Napoleonic 20 Series, and launches a new sub-series of Germany 20 1813 games (all of which will ultimately link into a campaign of connected battles with the results from one affecting the next in the series). Dresden 20 includes a bit more of everything than other games in this series (map size, counters and exclusive rules), thus allowing players to gain a deeper insight into the campaign around Dresden during those fateful days. Important decisions weighing up all of the principles of war must be made to win this campaign!

Can you maintain French dominance with a coalition-ending smashing victory? Or as the Allies end Napoleons ambitions in central Europe by storming your way across the map?

121429,Ascari,2012,7.45833,36,1.8333,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Post-Napoleonic Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"Ascari is a company-level game based on the stories of loyal solders who fought for Italy in Eritrea, the first Italian colony. The game depicts four battles in which the Italians were the protagonists: the two battles of Agordat against the Dervishes, Amba Alagi, and Coatit against the Ethiopians. A bonus scenario depicting the battle of Metemma between the Dervishes and the Ethiopian Emperor Johannes IV is also included.

Here are the description of the Scenarios:
S1 First Agordat:
A raiding party of Dervishes are caught by the Ascari troops commanded by Captain Gustavo Fara in the plain of Agordat.

S2 Agordat:
2200 native Askari and some Italian national soldiers, led by Lt. Colonel Arimondi, encounters in the plain of Agordat around 12,000 Mahdists, led by the Amir of Ghedaref, attempting to invade the Italian Colony of Eritrea. An astonishing Italian victory and the very first one of the young nation.

S3 Coatit:
The Italian Army in Eritrea, led by General Baratieri, wins its last victory before Adowa, attacking the overhelming Ras Mangashas Army at Coatit, fighting two days and performing a perfect redeployment under enemy fire. Tactically a draw, but stra-tegically a victory.

S4 Amba Alagi
The political quarrel between Gen. Arimondi and Eritrea Governor Baratieri led the IV Native Bat-talion to be put in the advanced position of Amba Alagi, just in front of the full Negus Menelik Ethiopian Army. Arimondi wanted to repeat Agordat, when with few troops managed to win the day, and therefore, despite Baratieris order to withdraw the Battalion, he didnt forward it to Lt. Toselli, condemning hime and his men to sure death it will be the prelude to Adowa!

S5 Metemma
After the sack of the historic capital city of Gondar in 1888, Negus Neghesti Johannes IV gathered an army to repel the Mahdists from the city of Metemma. While on the way to victory, the Ethiopians melt away demoralized by the killing of their Emperor during the final assault.

I know they do because I've seen the little critters fighting over nuts, drooling over nuts, taking other animals hostage while demanding nuts as ransom. In short, they'll do almost anything for nuts  and since you are a squirrel in Nuts!, you must now be as equally nut-crazed.

To start the game, each player receives one nut card  which come in values 1-5, with a single 7 pointer  and five cards from the play deck. The play cards go in your hand, and the nut is placed face up on the table in front of you. Play cards come in four types:

 Grab cards let you grab a nut from another player's stash in various ways, for example, Grab any one nut card worth 4 or less.

 Defense cards can prevent your nuts from being grabbed, e.g., Stop someone from grabbing one of your nuts.

 Mayhem cards are bad things that can happen, e.g., Choose two other players. They must both miss their next turn.

 Antics cards are ways that things do not go as planned when grabbing nuts, e.g., Draw the top card of the nut deck and put it in your stash.

On a turn, you first reveal the top nut card and add it to your stash. Then you play one Grab, Mayhem or Antics card on another player; that player may play a Defend card to possibly prevent your action. Instead of playing a card, you can discard any number of cards from your hand, then draw replacements from the play deck. As soon as someone has more than 20 points worth of nuts, the game ends and this player wins.

It covers the Allied attempts to push convoys through the Norwegian and Barents Seas while German aircraft, submarines and surface ships try to stop them. Famous convoy operations like those of PQ12 and PQ17, British carrier raids, German-Soviet destroyer skirmishes along the Arctic coast  all of these and more are included. Like all games in the series, this one come stuffed with scenarios and variations on them.

Most scenarios are very straightforward  each side knows what the other must do. The Allied player has large convoys of vital merchant shipping that must reach their destination. The German player has bases in Norway well-placed to intercept them, with submarines and aircraft that can hit them almost continuously. As in Bomb Alley, aircraft are drawn in a semi-random fashion so neither player has perfect intelligence about their numbers and location. German surface ships are few in number, but there's a lot of open sea in which they can hide and strike the convoys at vulnerable moments. And with war raging simultaneously on many other fronts, the convoy escort forces are stretched very, very thin.

There are two maps, covering the Norwegian and Barents Seas from Iceland in the southwest to Novaya Zemlya in the northeast, from the Norwegian coast to the Arctic pack ice. It's one of the larger play areas in the Second World War at Sea series, and unlike Leyte Gulf's three maps, both of these are in use in almost every scenario. Players quickly get a sense of the huge and desolate oceans in which they must operate.

The game features various scenarios in which the average infantry squad would become involved.  Typical scenarios simulate meeting engagements, ambushes, raids, snatch missions and assualts on fortified positions.

Sequel to the game Sniper! (first edition) Popular tactical combat system.

As in Sniper, each player controls the equivalent of a squad of 5 to 15 men depending on the period, the scenario, and whether you attack or defend. One scenario corresponds to a few (one to five) minutes of real time action. The scale is a little larger than in Sniper (5 meters/hex, 5 seconds/turn vs 3 and 3 in Sniper), and there is no facing. The game system (though rated 7.1, ie pretty high, on SPI complexity scale), is quite straightforward and easy to learn. In the beginning of each turn, players secretly buy actions for all of their men. A normal man has 10 Movement Points to expend per turn. Fire, direct or opportunity, consumes all MP, as reloading one's weapon, or rearming (ie readying to use it after throwing a grenade or shooting a rifle grenade). Standing up, preparing a grenade, throwing it, cost 5MP. And movement costs MP depending on terrain...
After all actions have been plotted, players check for panic: a certain percentage of all your men, depending on their hex number, have their actions canceled, or move randomly. (although very annoying, this rule does wonders at simulating low level control problems). Then, all remaining actions are performed: combat, movement, and finally grenade and artillery impacts. Rules cover a large variety of equipment: weapons like rifles, MP, MG, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and flamethrowers, but also barbed wire, pillboxes, artillery, mines, and up to one vehicle (APC or tank) per side. Five kind of combat situations are covered: patrol, reconnaissance, ambush, raid and assault. Some lending themselves quite well to solitaire play. A large number of scenarios (from WWI to modern) are provided, and you can easily design your own. A standard scenario plays in a couple of hours. Altogether, I think the system is pretty good for such a man to man combat situation. However, be warned that this very detailed scale has a peculiar feeling, which not all tactical game players (ie players used to ASL or Gamers TCS, which focus on company/battalion level units) will like:
in Patrol! the player is a sergeant, not a captain.

These include German, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Romanian units; the latter two will eventually switch sides.

The game contains 8 scenarios that place various combinations of aircraft, surface ships, and submarines at the players' disposal. The map is broken up into irregular spaces containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).

Pieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.

Each side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 = detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.

Combat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.

They need to reach the Sacred Island to present offerings and prayers to the gods, but the irascible Poseidon will use all his power to prevent them from getting there.

In Odyssey: Wrath of Poseidon, one player takes the role of Poseidon, God of the Sea, while the others become navigators in search of the Sacred Island. Gameplay takes place on two copies of the same game board that are separated by the game box so that they are not visible to one another. The Poseidon player throws powerful storms against the Navigators, driving them off-course and confounding them so that they cannot reach the Sacred Island in time. Only Poseidon knows the real position of the ships as indicated on his copy of the game board.

The navigators must sail through endless storms, blind to all around them, trying to gather clues to their whereabouts to stay on course. They also track the position of their ships on the game board, but the positions indicated are only a best guess  and they can become increasingly inaccurate as the game progresses.

The navigators must use their wits to stay on course and reach the Sacred Island before the end of the game, while Poseidon wins by preventing them from reaching their destination.

Compete against rival teams to patent inventions and work to improve the knowledge of your inventors. The inventing team who has patented the most inventions or who has the smartest inventors wins.

In more detail, the game takes place over three ages, with each age representing a different period of technological advancement and those inventions becoming more complex in each subsequent age. On a turn, you either send one of your inventors to work on an invention or refresh your inventors to make all of them available again. When you send an inventor to work you apply that character's skills  Albert Einstein has a starting skill of four Physics, for example, while Johannes Gutenberg has a starting skill of two Mechanics  against the needs of the invention, marking off what you've done with colored cubes.

When an invention is complete, the three players who have contributed the most reap the rewards of its completion! Players can choose to acquire and patent the invention by placing the invention card face up in front of them, or they earn reward tokens to upgrade their inventors, gain extra victory points, and even add additional knowledge to an invention.

As soon as all but two inventions in an age are complete, that age ends and a new one begins. After the third age, the team of inventors with the most victory points wins!

After the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, the university was closed and the professor lost his job. He came up with the idea to sell the game to financially support his family. In occupied Warsaw, Hodowla zwierzątek (Little animal farm)  as the game was then known  became extremely popular. After the end of the war, the game was forgotten and it reappeared on store shelves only in the 1990s through Granna.

Rancho, designed by Michael Stajszczak, was made to honor the memory of Karol Borsuk and to commemorate the success of Hodowla zwierzątek, a.k.a. Super Farmer. Rancho expands the possibilities which Karol Borsuk's original game presented to players as now farmers must not only exchange their animals well and breed them, but also plan purchases of pastures on which to graze their herds.
 In more detail, you breed animals in order to have the best ranch in the region. You buy pastures so that your animals will have a place to live. Your animals breed and this brings you profit. You can convert animals to other types of animals if you decide it's worth it, or you can buy more pastures to have space for more animals. To win, you must be the first to collect a herd consisting of at least a horse, a cow, a sheep, and a rabbit. But all your plans can go awry if you are not careful because in the nearby forest there are prowling predators, specifically a wolf and a fox. Your animals can easily become their prey...

In Micro Monsters, four races of horribly cute aliens  Autogators, Bigbears, Finbacks, and Turboturtles  face off, with each race wanting to close the rival monsters' dimensional gates. Using dexterity-based game play similar to that in MicroMutants and X-Bugs  and more commonly seen in Tiddly Winks  players in Micro Monsters shoot their monster tokens across the playing area by pressing on one edge of them with a monster shooter to send them flying. Land on an opponent, even with the tiniest bit of your monster, and you capture that opponent's token, removing it from play. Land on an opponent's gate, on the other hand, and you remove one of that opponent's energy tokens; take an opponent's final token and she must flip her gate to the damaged side. Land on a damaged gate, and that opponent is out of the game!

At the start of a player's turn, that player first rolls a die. If he rolls a monster, he takes his normal turn; if he rolls his race's special symbol, he uses his special alien power:


    Autogators move two separate monsters on the same turn.
    Bigbears move one monster, then place a trap on an opponent's monster to immobilize it until the next Bigbears turn.
    Finbacks move the same monster twice on the same turn.
    Turboturtles move one monster, then place a shield on it that prevents it from being captured until that player's next turn.


The last player to have an open gate  whether damaged or not  wins!

767,Keywood,1995,6.89149,47,2,2,5,120,120,,Civilization ,Voting,"from Game Cabinet Review:

2 - 5 players attempt to settle and govern a new land of six villages. Each player may only introduce two new villagers per turn across five or six turns total. Villagers start as farmers earning a fixed income. Part of that income may be spent to purchase trade licenses which allow your villagers to set up as traders. Traders earn an income based on the population of their village. Each village must also elect a representative to government each turn. These councilors move to town and have no income for that turn (so much for realism - there is no provision for special interest groups or political action committees!). The government must decide whether to tax the farmers, tax the traders, or revoke one type of trade license. When this session of government breaks up councilors can either pay their own way home or pay a small fee and remain in government for another turn (well, at least that sounds realistic!). Each turn a new marketplace is opened which doubles the income of the host village. The villages bid fiercely for the right to host the new market each turn. Finally, the villagers and traders earn income and pay their taxes. The player that has the most money after the last round of play inherits control of the lands of Keywood and wins the game.

Keywood is Richard Breese's first game in the key series.

First installment in Moments in History's T3 series, which has subsequently become the Schwerpunkt series for GMT Games LLC. Hallmarks of the system are ease of play and the fog of war element.

Contrary to the playing time above this game takes about 6 hours to play unless their is an earlier sudden death decision.

Features C3I points used to generate the number of units that can be activated to move and the number of attacks that can be made during each segment.  There are three segments per turn in which each player must begin by deciding whether they will move and then attack or attack and then move.  Not only is combat strength compared but also a unit's tactical rating when resolving combats.  The side with the higher tactical rating gets to draw more random chits most of which have beneficial drms for that side. To a limited extent combat losses can be converted into retreats and enemy retreats can occasionally result in an additional advance for the attacker.  Occasionally, extreme die rolls allow additional spontaneous activities.  ZoCs are hard except friendly units allow tracing supply through them.  Loss of supply reduces unit effectiveness and can result in attrition.  Victory is determined mostly by units losses but also the Soviet control of objective cities and the presence of even one friendly unit on the other players side of the Donets river provides a healthy number of VPs.  Both players begin with units in this position and so cancel each other out.

All in all it is a tense game.  The Russian player with the benefit of hindsight can avoid many of the hazards of the original campaign by not over extending himself.

Power uses this same general concept, only minus all the devil-inspired backstabbing that makes Diplomacy what it is.  In this game, players are given equal forces consisting of ships, planes and other weapons of modern warfare, including a 'nuke' of sorts.  Each turn, players can move a set number of their pieces based on the chosen piece's movement.  The board is a painfully simple system of orthogonal squares.  Once all moves for a given turn have been written down, all pieces are moved simultaneously.  If more than one force's pieces occupy the same space, then a superiority check is made with each type of piece contributing a set number of strength points (usually inversely related to movement).  The largest force then takes possession of all opposing pieces, making the shift in power quite significant, and the central theme for the remainder of the game.

195232,Red Poppies Campaigns: The Battles for Ypres,2016,7.9578,30,3,1,2,120,1440,,Wargame World War I ,Hex-and-Counter,"Red Poppies Campaigns (RPC) enables players to game WWI battles from the perspective of battalion and regimental command posts.  Players unleash opening bombardments and then maneuver infantry companies against machine gun fire to fight battles on historically accurate maps of actual battlefields.  The streamlined system for fire and movement enables a rapid ebb and flow with minimal dice rolling and lots of historical chrome.  Generally speaking, units can move or fire once per turn  machine gun fire is the notable, unpredictable exception  and can initiate melee after a move.  Fire resolution requires only one dice roll, made by the target and modified for the relevant circumstances such as incoming firepower, terrain, visibility, etc.  Throughout, players must effectively manage the dynamic tension between top down control and bottom up initiative to get their units onto the objective before their ever-eroding control crumbles to nil.

A tragic irony of WWI unifies all aspects of game play.  For most of the war, effective command and control of tactical units required a degree of concentration which threatened their survival.  In other words, the game illustrates the inverse relationship between a units responsiveness to orders and its durability.  So players must form infantry units to get them moving and then disperse them at the right moment to hold the ground gained.  Enemy fire can force premature dispersion which must be remedied to get an attack moving again.  For infantry, the formed condition represents troops arrayed for the convenience of top down command such as those deployed in skirmish line or a column-of-march while the dispersed condition represents troops spread out and hunkered down for their own survival.

The game illustrates the evolution of tactics during WWI.  In time, gas wafts across the battlefield, unit statistics change to show better performance while dispersed, a new method of tactical command and control (the blob) emerges, mortars pop up like mushrooms after the rain, and artillery becomes more responsive.  In addition to short, standalone scenarios, RPC has a campaign mechanism so players can link a series of interdependent scenarios to simulate battles that spanned days, and nights.  During these campaigns, the results of one scenario affect the start of another so conservation of force, supply lines, and replacements all become issues.  Players will get a sense of slogging forward in yards per day - at great cost  as they plot days of grinding combat.

Napoleon at the Berezina is a solitaire game of the last major action of the 1812 campaign.

The winner for the round gets to place both beams as a part of their frog's tongue. The player who was second, gets to place the shorter of their two beams as part of their frog's tongue. The owner of the frog that first touches the princess, who is a couple of board lengths aways, with its tongue is transformed into the Frog King and wins the game.

169795,Haithabu,2015,6.25672,128,3.4,2,4,0,120,,Economic ,Pick-up and DeliverTradingWorker Placement,"Haithabu is named after an important trading settlement located at the southern end of the Jutland Peninsula (on what's today the border of Denmark and Germany) that the Vikings used from the 8th to the 11th centuries. Its location on the Baltic and North Seas and on the trade routes between Scandinavia and the Frankish Empire led to goods from around the known world  such as the Baltics, Baghdad, and Constantinople  being traded here.

The subject of constant wars and changes of power, as well as the progressive Christianization of those in the north, Haithabu  known as Hedeby in English  had a rich history that ended in 1050 when the Norwegian king sacked and burned the town in a conflict with Denmark.

As Vikings, players trade with all the known world while also living through the changes and dark days at the end of the Early Middle Ages. In the game, players take turns performing individual actions on an action rondel, and what's most critical in the game is the timing of the actions because in each round each color of action can be selected only once. Players must react to market price changes and event dice that can cause complications.

Once again, the Napoleonic 20 game system expands, this time to a Portuguese pursuit where a delicious battlefield puzzle awaits both sides as armies and personalities clash in Bussaco 20. It is (literally) an uphill fight to the French, but the British are outnumbered and all is within the grasp of Marshal Massena -- but will he grasp for victory or his mistress?

Featuring only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of story-driven random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and friction of war that gives players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!

25841,Le Grand Empire,2007,7.173,50,3.7,2,7,0,0,Wargames,Napoleonic Wargame ,Chit-Pull SystemHex-and-CounterSimulation,"Le Grand Empire simulates the Napoleonic wars from 1800 to 1815 at a strategic level. Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the players will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.

The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.

The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.

At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their units production and maintenance. Diplomacy is the key point in creating alliances with other powers, major or minor. Moreover, many random events improve the Napoleonic flavor of that time.

The overall purpose of the Grand Empire is to provide a strategic Napoleonic game that takes into account historical, military and diplomatic sights, and that can be played in a short period of time (one year is four turns and can be played in two hours) with a reasonable amount of rules.

Contents :
 * Two maps
 * 3 countersheets (260 double sided counters each).

9077,La Grande Armée,1972,6.65227,66,2.9375,1,2,150,150,Wargames,Napoleonic Wargame ,Hex-and-Counter,"La Grande Armee is an operational wargame covering three distinct Napoleonic campaigns in central Europe. There are scenarios covering the 1805 campaign against Austria, the 1806 campaign against Prussia and the 1809 campaign against Austria (again). The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario. The game includes a 22 x 28 map, a 400 counter sheet (although there are a number of blank counters) as well the rules (accordion format), and separate sheets for the scenarios and tables. The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI. La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders. Note this game is totally different from the later TSR remake of the same title.

Displeased by his children, the Pharaoh favors his pets instead. He has decided to alter the lines of succession and will bequeath his entire kingdom either to the feline goddess Bast or to the canine god Anubis, but which one?

In Heir to the the Pharaoh you and your opponent play as Bast and Anubis, each one vying for the Pharaoh's affection  and for his throne! Impress the Pharaoh by digging your mighty paws into the sand. Build majestic Shrines, Sun Temples and Obelisks! Use Animal Magic to unleash the power of the gods, who will help you win the favor of the Pharaoh!

In more detail, the game combines intense card play with a spacious and colorfully illustrated game board. It mingles multiple mechanisms, including civilization-building (with tile placement and network building), bidding, set collection, area control, and hand management (with players required to exchange all used cards with their opponent at the end of each round). Seven separate player abilities re-combine each round, depending on the favor of the gods earned that round by each player. For example, earning the favor of the god Ra lets you add a Player Disc to the current Sun for area control around the edges of the board. Ptah allows you to claim the current Monument Card for set collection scoring. Seshat lets you place the current Monument Standee on the board to add to the network of Monuments in play. Geb and Nut let you claim and rotate this Monument Standee and aim it at other Monuments to score points. The Pharaoh lets you secretly contribute cards to the construction of the Pyramid, awarding the greater contributor many points at the end of the game.

Over a series of eight rounds, players work to build a Pyramid and a series of smaller monuments to impress the Pharaoh. By performing actions unique to each god, players build monuments and align them to point at other monuments, gaining influence over the Pharaoh as they do so. Once the Pyramid is completed, the player with the most points is declared the Heir to the Pharaoh and wins the game.

2427,Skirmish,1975,6.0932,147,1.7778,2,2,60,60,Wargames,Age of Reason American Revolutionary War Wargame ,Dice RollingPoint to Point Movement,"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games, highly prized by collectors.

This one is the American War of Independence game. The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special Continental Army unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.

The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.

A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).

A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).

Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.

The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.

The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.

In Wizards Gambit, players become wizards who take turns placing Magical Components on Spells in a common Spell Pool in the center of the play area.

When all of the required Magical Components have been placed on a given Spell, the wizard who completed that Spell claims it as their own, creating a Spell Book face up in front of them. Once the Spell is added to their Spell Book, a wizard may immediately apply the effects of the Spell, giving him more power to defeat his competitors.

Wizards can further affect the course of play by casting Incantation cards during their turn, which can provide advantages in playing the game. Additionally, wizards can invoke the highest power, the Wizards Gambit, to thwart other wizard competitors and increase their chance of claiming powerful Spells for their own.

Each Spell has a point value, which adds up cumulatively to represent their Spell Books score. The first wizard to reach a Spell point total of ten (10) points wins the game and is proclaimed Grand Siege Magus.

Wizard's Gambit is a light-hearted game for the casual gamer and for family play.

Instead of the full campaign game, players may also choose to play the shorter scenario that ends in 1779.

Each inch on the area map, which covers all of North America from the Mississippi River east, including the Caribbean, equals 100 miles. Each brigade-sized unit represents two to four battalions (about 1,500 to 4,000 men). Each game turn represents one year. All the games charts and tables are printed on the mapsheet.

The rules contain a total of 13,000 words, which works out to allow two experienced players to finish a game in four to five hours. The system can be fudged for solitaire play.

Rules cover such things as: initiative, rabble rousing, revolutionary political progress, colonial loyalties, the European balance of power, mobilizing new units, forced march, supply and forage, enlistment expirations, leaders, fog of war, fleets, French and Spanish alliances, Hessians, Indian sovereignty, fortresses and sieges, partisans, militia, overrun, massacre, political vs. military victory, frontier warfare, honors of war, grenadiers, light troops, detachments, regulars, and much more.

But the world of Munchkin is also sad and benighted, a place where those very same Munchkins are all too often backstabbed by buddies, dined on by dragons, and discovered by doom ducks. Heroes delve too deep, plummet down pits, and lose their loot  and that's before they die.

This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.

Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).

For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.

During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player loses his shirt i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.

It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place  Show and Undercover (a.k.a. Heimlich  Co.).

Tactical 4X thematic action  Burning Suns is not a traditional 4X game. It takes the 4X actions and gives you complete tactical control. This means you'll have to adapt and improvise on the way to victory. A strategy can only take you this far; in the meantime you'll have to rely on your ability to analyze the situation and calculate the best possible moves ahead of you. Being able to force, trick and outmaneuver your opponents is key to success. Seize opportunities as they arise and don't wait for the perfect moment  because it doesn't exist! It's about being proactive and reactive according to your chances and the risk you're willing to take!

Create an Empire  You'll be able to create no less than 1000 possible empires, using the three elements of Ideology, Race and Framework, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.

Galaxies in motion  Galaxies can be created just as you see them fit  and they might evolve during a game.

Immediate actions  The order in which actions are executed changes every turn. All actions in Burning Suns are carried out immediately and players are therefore involved throughout the game, bringing downtime to a minimum.

Your empire, your strategy  In Burning Suns there are many ways to victory depending upon your empire, how you use abilities, leaders and agents, whether you choose to ally or conquer worlds, and how you choose to engage your opponents with the many various units.

Days of Decision consists of 2 games in 1. The standard 1936-1939 game requires not other components than those provided in this game. It is played on the map of Europe and the Pacific and uses an abstract combat system to represent the conflicts occurring in this period.

Finally, there is also a World in Flames mini scenario of the Spanish Civil War which requires some components from World in Flames.


This game can be played alone or as a pre-game of 1930s politics for World in Flames also by ADG.

The game is about who will (if any) declare the Second World War, how the production of the Major Powers are at the time of war  and how the many small nations will align (Axis or Allied).

Your job? Picking refurbished or out-of-date parts to build robots that meet eager buyers' requirements. Sell your completed robots to earn points and achieve certain bonuses to earn even more points  but hurry because other players may be building a robot to sell to the same buyer first.  Can you outsmart your opponents and assemble a four-wheeler robot with two heads, or a robot with six eyes and four hands before they do?

In Robots on the Line, robot parts move down two conveyor belts. Players take turns pulling robot parts (heads, bases, arms, hands, batteries, antennas and magnets). Not all robot parts can be taken, however. The line you're pulling from must be switched to ON. Robot parts that aren't taken will be discarded onto the junk pile. Players can pay a dollar to go through the junk pile or they can pay a dollar to turn ON/OFF switches. As players take robot parts, they build robots in front of them. Players can build up to four robots in a game. Trading is always allowed.

To finish a robot it must have a torso, a head, and a base with all other segments off the torso ended with the other parts. While you're building, you'll want to look to the buyers to meet their requirements. A requirement might be a robot with four eyes, or a robot that has no wheels, or a robot with three hands. If you meet a buyer's requirement, you sell it for money. If you meet the bonuses, like medical, war, or cleaning, you get even more money. The game ends when all tiles are off the line or when a player has built 3 robots. The player with the most money wins.

Age of Thieves is a fantasy board game of strategy and adventure set in Hadria, a port metropolis located on the northern fringes of a mighty Empire. Each player becomes a master thief about to commit the most daring burglary of his career. During the game players may use unique abilities of their thieves as well as various action cards, which represent maneuvers, alchemical potions or complicated devices inspired by visionary ideas of Renaissance inventors. The players choose cards to play and then use available Action Points to plan the order of their activities. This makes the game very dynamic, with each resolved action dramatically influencing the turn. The players order changes dynamically depending on the number of Action Points placed on each chosen card.

The goal of the game is to break into the vault inside the Emperor's palace and steal the Emperors' Jewel, the symbol of power very precious to the ruling dynasty. However, this is hardly the end, because thieves must escape from the city with their loot. This is no easy task - the streets are patrolled by vigilant city guards and veteran captains well versed in all criminal tricks. Additionally, time is running fast for the thieves - event cards introduced each turn control the flow of the game, escalating its pace and difficulty of challenges for the players to overcome.

The thief who will manage to escape through one of four city gates taking with him the Emperors Jewel or other valuable loot will be the winner of the game. Anyone who will stay inside Hadria after resolving the last event card will be caught and mercilessly thrown inside the city dungeon, their names erased from the annals of the omnipotent Guild.

Depending on the age of the players, players decide if they play with the 36 wooden pieces, or with the 25 picture tiles.  The other pieces are not needed in either case.

The 36 wooden pieces or 25 picture tiles are mixed up and laid out in a circle.
The game figure is placed on any of the wooden pieces or picture tiles.  
The 36 (or 25, respectively) small gold coins, and the large gold coin are placed in the center of the circle.

On a players turn, he or she moves the game figure forward either one, two or three places clockwise along the circle.  The player then takes the wooden piece that the game figure is standing over, and places the piece in front of themself so it is visible to all players.  The game figure remains in the empty space.

When a player takes the last piece of a color (ie. yellow) or the last of a shape (ie. triangle), the game is interrupted, and scoring takes place.  Every player who has a piece of this color or shape in front of them receives a small gold coin for each of these pieces. When playing with the picture tiles, scoring is based on the colors or animals. (with only 5 gold coins)
If the taken piece is the last one of a color and shape, there is a double scoring: 6 (or 5) small coins for the appropriate color and 6 (or 5) for the appropriate shape (or animal) are distributed.

Two players  Black and White  begin the game with 24 stones each, disposed initially on the red band, and take turns to move one stone at a time. Stones enjoy the freedom of chess Queens, except that with every move they must come to rest on a band closer to the Throne. A stone flanked by two adverse stones (either orthogonally or diagonally) is captured and defects to the other player. The aim is to capture the Throne for one's own King by completing a 'frame' (i.e., a rotationally-symmetrical arrangement of four stones) around it at any distance. The Throne may change hands any number of times in the course of play, but whichever side's King is in occupation at game's end (i.e. when one player, on his turn, has no available move) is the winner. If the Throne remains neutral throughout, the game is drawn.

     (Designer clarification) Neither Ming Mang nor Othello.  That's to say: one can see (sort of) why these supposed similarities were posted - initial board set-up resembling Ming Mang (though not really any longer since the May 2015 update), custodial capture as in Othello (though even then with major differences) - but actually these analogies are not very different from saying that soccer = American football = hockey because all are ball games played by teams of 11 on rectangular fields of similar size.  You may or may not be a fan of Morelli, but either way there's no escaping the fact that in its gameplay it's just about as unlike any other Abstract as you can get.

Each turn they roll their dice and arrange them into two sequences of three dice (with one re-roll to try to change unwanted dice into something else).  These sequences are then compared to those of everyone else.  Higher difficulty dances (sequences) like the Tango or Tap Dance impress the judges.  Less accomplished dancers move down in ranking.  If they hit the bottom of the chart, they are out of the game.  Certain sequences also convey special abilities such as not having to move down in ranking even if you are out danced by your competition.

The last dancer still standing wins!

A game of single combat...between the Gods and Heroes of ancient Greece and Troy.  To the mundane scholars of academe, the Trojan War was fought for control of the ancient Black Sea trade routes.  To the Romantic, it was fought over Helen of Troy, 'the face that launched a thousand ships and burned the topless towers of Ilium.' Whatever the cause, romantic or commercial, the war raged ten long years and involved the greatest warriors of that ancient age.  Behind them stood the Olympian gods who, although forbidden by Zeus from intervening decisively, nevertheless gave what help they could to the side they favored.  The Iliad is a fast-moving game of the entire ten-year war which has formed the basis for Homer's epic Iliad.  Features include -


     Every important Greek and Trojan hero is individually represented
     Heroes face each other in single combat as they vie for superiority
     Olympian gods may receive appeals and aid their chosen heroes
     Special rules cover the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles: if the quarrel is set aside, Achilles joins the battle, much to the dismay of the Trojans.

Squadron Strike takes between 5 and 10 minutes per turn with 6 ships per side, and combines fast play with more tactical depth and scalable detail than any other 'construction ready' space combat game. Its suitable for Ages 12 and up.

In Squadron Strike, ships move in one of three movement modes, named for the number of Newtons Laws being obeyed; with these options youre not stuck with whatever movement mode the game designer liked - you can pick the one that works best for the setting youre trying to run in. You even have optional fuel rules (for both interstellar and tactical movement) to simulate the setting or TV series to whatever degree you like. You decide what reality level is appropriate for your level of fun.

You can design nearly everything in the game, from missiles, to beams, to fighters, to torpedoes. An original setting includes pre-built ships and weapons for people who dont want to get deeply into the customization process, but if you want it, you have complete control.

Automated tools do complete SSD generation for you, in Excel format, or with higher end features via web applications.

Squadron Strike comes with a complete, integrated campaign system, including web apps that automatically generate campaign maps, victory decks, and system maps. Just enter the campaign turn in the web app and the positions of the planets on the system map update automatically!

The boxed game will have two map sheets, a bag of tilt blocks, two bags of stacking tiles, box miniature sheets, a rulebook, an SSD book and a setting book. The ship design tools are available as a free download in Excel; the web applications (including a nicer ship design tool set, and campaign support) are behind a subscriber login.

After 'The Little Prince' comes this year's The Little Ghost, based on the book by Otfried Preussler. The game picks up the storyline about the players, on the stroke of midnight, spending the witching hour flitting through the dark halls of Castle Eulenstein with the little ghost. Whenever the great clock in the city hall marks the passing of another hour, a picture shows up in one of the viewing windows. Whatever is shown on the picture is what the children must now find behind the closed doors of the castle. They accomplish this with the help of a mysterious magnetic set of keys that, as if through the hand of a ghost, opens the doors of the old castle. For each correctly-opened door one receives a gleaming cannonball. How many of these balls will be required for victory is decided only by the final dexterity game in the knight's hall.

Each Player earns Coins by selling crafted Gems and Jewels. The game is divided in Turns, every Turn is completed when each Player completes his Round.

At the start of the game the cards are placed in two rows, Characters and Gems, for a total of seven columns. Each column represents a City. Every city has two slots one for a Character one for a Resource.

During his Round a Player can execute three Actions from a list of six:

    Travel to another City 
    Buy Gems or Gold 
    Craft Jewels or Gems 
    Interact with a Character: Sell a Jewel or a Gem, hire a Mercenary or fight a Monster 
    Refill City slots if empty 
    Earn a Coin




The Player can travel between the columns, which represent Cities. Traveling between Cities costs Coins.

The Player can buy a Gem from his current City and add it to his hand.
Before a Jewel or a Gem can be sold, the Player has to spend a crafting action to lay the cards down. To craft a Jewel the Player needs also the right combination of Gems and Gold. So each Player always has a round to plot against the seller.

Selling a Jewel or a Gem to a Buyer means discarding it and earning its value in Coins. Mercenaries and Monsters can hinder or favor the Players. After a Player interacts with any Character, the card is added to the discard pile.

At the beginning of each turn the Cities are repopulated with new Characters and Gems. At this time many Events can be triggered.
The game ends when a City cant be refilled at the start of the Turn.

The Player with most Coins wins the game.

The object of the game is to collect the most prestige points. The further you advance your Captain, and the more men who survive the Antarctic winter at the end of the game, the more prestige your expedition receives. This requires careful management of crates, food and camps: without supplies, your explorers will not survive.

Play proceeds over a series of rounds. Within each round, players may make as many moves as they like, from those available, with each additional move becoming increasingly dangerous. In more detail, each turn, players may take an action (which involves taking a risk die from the action board, adding the die to their dice pool, then taking a corresponding action), or they choose to pass. Actions include moving explorers and crates, hunting for food, collecting research, and building camps. After completing an action, the active player rolls all the dice in their dice pool. High numbers result in exposure, the loss of supplies (crates and food), explorers being incapacitated, and even death. Exposure results can be offset by explorers remaining together (company) and the building of camps.

A round ends when all players have passed. At the end of the round, a weather card is drawn that may cause additional attrition, then the next round begins. When the pack ice card is drawn from the weather deck, one last round is played and the game ends.

A contender advances to the next round when they receive a majority of the votes of the players. The players vote based on a question asked. For example, the contenders in the first round might be Dolly Parton vs. street mime. The question might be, Who would you rather be for a day? All the players debate the match-up and then all openly vote on it. Play continues like this for each match-up.

Each player makes their picks, and gets their points based on what contender they believe will win the entire tourney(4), who will make it to the championship round(2 for each pick), who will make it to the final four (1 for each pick), and a bonus pick(4). The bonus pick is where each player tries to guess what one of the other players will choose as the winner of the tournament. The points for each pick is in parentheses.

The contenders are drawn randomly from 500 tiles and placed on the bracket in four categories (including an example of one contender from each.)
Arenas - aka Places - Jamaica
Contenders - aka People - Mark Twain
Moves - aka Actions - Showering
Gear - aka Things- Cocktails

After all the tiles are placed, a player draws a random Knockoutcard. This Knockout card is the question for the final, championship round. Once every player sees that question, they make their picks and place them in an envelope until the end of the game.

The object is make accurate picks as well as secretly convince the other players to pick your choices.

75809,Pocket Pro Golf,2010,6.808,50,1.9286,1,4,30,30,,Dice Print & Play Sports ,Dice RollingModular Board,"Tee up for the opening drive!

Pocket Pro Golf brings you the best aspects of real golf--club selection, careful aim, and shot consideration--in a pocket sized game that will fit in any golf bag.

One to four players can play anywhere from a single hole to a full round of 18 holes.

Unlike many other golf games, Pocket Pro Golf shows you the narrative of each shot as it works its way down the fairway. Watch as your ball comes perilously close to each hazard. Did you plan the shot well enough to keep your ball on course?

Each hole is created using a series of modular game cards. Hazards and features can be set up at random or arranged to resemble any hole from any golf course in the world.

Once the hole is assembled, players must choose the right club, aim carefully (taking wind into account) and hit the ball with the right swing tempo. Too fast and you'll lose control of the ball. Too slow and your ball won't go far enough.

The core of the game uses a clever movement mechanic that combines loss of control with distance. You use a number of dice to represent swing tempo (one two or three for slow, moderate and fast). Doubles and triples represent the effects of wind and slope, causing your ball to make semi-random deviations from a straight shot. Roll more dice and you're more likely to lose control and have your ball drift off course!

The terrain analysis includes rivers, woods, rough, mountains, karst, swamp, and impassable mountains. Six-hundred die cut counters represent the military units of the nine mations that took part in the campaign. Units are deployed as individual battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions - each with its historical designation, strengths, and capabilities.

For each hairpin, gentle curve, and straightaway on the track, players play a speed card, attempting to be the fastest car through that section. Higher speeds and more dangerous sections of track, however, will increase the wear and tear on your tires, fuel, and engine. Drop below zero in any of these and youll blow a tire, run out of fuel, or burst into a ball of flame. The player who crosses the finish line with the most speed points is declared the winner. Famous 500 is the third game in Famous Games Companys line of World’s Smallest Sports Games and has earned a reputation as the most strategic and cutthroat title in the series.

In Ghostbusters: Protect the Barrier Game, you have to keep your eye on the number of ghost figures on the board.

In more detail, players roll dice to determine how many spaces they move this turn and whether a new ghost is added to the board. Players may move up to the number of spaces shown on the die. If they end their movement in a space with a PED, they may pick it up. If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die. If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board. If the players must add a third ghost to a room, it transforms into a haunting.

This game on the Battle of Sanluri uses is the same as that of Guelphs and Ghibellines published by Europa Simulazioni.

In the game, each player takes the role of the Commander-in-chief of  one of the two armies. Each army consists of various battaglie, with each battaglia' composed of various units. The players are given the  task of choosing and issuing specific orders for their battaglie. The game system emphasizes the progressive deterioration of the battaglie efficiency during the battle and tries to simulate the  entropy on the field of battle and its effects on the chain of command  and the victory perception. The game includes rules for historical, alternative or free scenarios.

The game includes basic rules and advanced rules, and more complex aircraft managements rules. The 2 maps use hexagons to regulate placement and movement of units, and have overlays for the hills creating a 3D effect. The smaller map represents the area around the Golan Heights: the frontier region between Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The Jordan River crosses the map from north to south, with the Galilean Sea in the middle. The big map represents the Sinai, focused on the area around the Suez Canal.

The basic game is only played on the Sinai map. Each turn corresponds to 2 days and is subdivided into 10 phases. The Egyptian player goes first, taking 4 phases. Then the Israeli player takes 6 phases. During each phase players can move their units. Combat takes place, using a calculation based on the number of units a player has.

The advanced game is played on both maps by 2, 3, or 4 players. The aircraft combat rules are introduced. The aircraft are divided into 3 categories: bombers, interceptors, and fighter-bombers. Each turn is divided into 9 phases. Arabian player turn has 4 phases and the Israeli 5.

Victory is calculated by comparing victory points:
- for Israel, 20 points if Damascus is occupied, 5 points for any other Syrian city occupied, 2 points for each intact bunker, 1 point for each reduced bunker, 5 points for each unit standing west of the Canal, 2 points for each Egyptian bridge destroyed.
- for the Arabs, 10 points for each Israeli city occupied, 2 points if the Syrian bunker remains intact, 10 points for each controlled pass, 1 point for each unit exiting along the coast road to Israel, 1 point for each Israeli unit eliminated. If less than 16 units are standing east of the Canal, the player has to remove (16 - number of unit) to the score.

					In the Beginning

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. It took him six days to complete his work, assisted by a host of heavenly angels doing his divine bidding. On the seventh day God rested and examined the result. Seeing that it was good, he praised the angel who had contributed the most.

Genesis - In the Beginning gives you the chance to become that angel. By gathering the essence of creation - chaos, matter and life - and turning it into seas and mountains, birds and beasts, you hope to win Gods approval - and the game! But the way to victory is wrought with hard decisions. You must gather essence when it's most advantageous, move at the right time and do your days work where they count the most. And beware of the dark angel who's trying to outshine you all.

					Gameplay

Before the creation, the players angels are gathered in the void with God. When God starts the creation with the words let there be light, the angels start their monumental task. Theres a lot do to and only seven days to get it done in, so every action counts. Throughout the game, God moves over each of the seven days on the game board, stopping morning, midday and evening, allowing the players 21 rounds to act. During their turn, players can choose to collect the essence of creation (chaos, matter and life), to do a day work on the current day using the different kinds of essence they have collected, or to follow in Gods path to another day.

When players move from day to day, theyre positioned along the essence track. The essence track determines both the order of play and the type of essence a player can gather. The first player to move to a certain day gets the first position, the second player the second position, and so on. As different positions yield different kinds of essence, the players must plan their movement to get the right kind and the right amount of essence. If theyre not happy with their position, they can spend essence to swap positions with a neighboring angel, thereby also thwarting other players plans.

When God creates a new day with new tasks for the angels, players can move to that day. The first player to do a day work on a certain day is awarded the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. As the week progresses, the points earned for doing a day work increase, which affects players long-term strategy.

As the seventh day is a day of rest, God looks favorably on angels that retire from their hard work. The first player to retire their angel on the seventh day earns the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. When God reaches the evening of the seventh day, the game is over. All points will be tallied and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.

To make things even more challenging, a dark angel is mixed in with the players angels, doing his best to snatch as many points as possible. The dark angel follows a pre-determined pattern of actions that the players can predict and delay but never stop. If the players arent careful, or if theyre too caught up in their own plans, the dark angel will surely outshine them, making all of them lose the game.

The mechanics of the game are quite simple: the sooner you do a day work on a day, the higher the points you score, making it a good idea to keep close in Gods wake. Unfortunately, simply following God throughout the creation might not give you the exact essence you need to do your day work. Eventually you must stop to collect essence, preferably in the right position, making you lose momentum. In the end its always about choices: when and what to collect, when to move and when to do a day work. The winner, God willing, is the player who makes the right choices at the right time, a task easier said than done.

131060,Ready to Rock!,2012,6.43,84,1.8333,3,9,20,20,,Card Game Humor Music Party Game Racing ,Area MovementCard DraftingPoint to Point Movement,"Ready to Rock! is the first party game set at a concert, and everyone wants to be the first rocker who reaches the stage. To maximize the concert feel, pictures taken at real concerts are used on the cards and guitar picks are the player pawns!

While Ready to Rock! is a pure card game, it also uses mechanisms of placement games. The rockers play their route cards, which represent the audience, then they move in different directions through the crowd so that in each match rockers will reach the front row through different paths.

Moreover to advance in every gig, rockers must obstruct other players' progress, perhaps pushing others back by using a special card or blocking their way with a wall card. What creates walls at a concert? Obviously the Mosh Pit, the Hell's Angels, and the Headbangers! A rocker once blocked should not despair as he can always change the direction of the crowd to open up new paths to move in other directions. In addition, Body Surfing might help you pass the obstacle and run toward the stage!

In the game, each rocker starts with four cards and can draw one card each turn. During his turn, he can play at most two cards. Cards are divided in three types: routes and walls  which have already been explained  and instants. The latter are bonuses he can use for himself (e.g., if you get beer, then you can draw two cards, or with flashing tits a player can use three cards in a turn) or against one opponent, such as ear plug (which makes him skip a turn), and smashed beer (which makes him discard two cards). There are also Ready to Rock! card, special cards that activate one of the stage cards to generate unforeseen effects on all rockers: special guest forces every rocker to draw one card, while shitty weather makes everyone discard one card and fire explosion muddles everything up by rotating all the path cards 180.

Ready to Rock! is a game with a unique real setting and is easy to learn, although some strategy tips are essential to win the game. Given the content of some cards, the game is not suitable for children: for instance, in lots of beer there's a guy drinking two beers at once and in flashing tits a girl shows her tits to the entire stadium. It's perfect, however, by the age of 14!

Wagram 1809 simulates one of Napoleon's greatest victories. After the troubling defeat at Essling on 22 May 1809, and still holding Vienna, Napoleon needed to renew his confidence and finish the campaign.
For the second time, Napoleon crossed the Danube to meet the force of Archduke Charles. This time, however, preparations for the crossing were better and during the night of 4-5 july he managed to get most of his troops across.
The battle of Wagram could then commence, and it would last for two days.

The game is at divisional scale and uses a plotted system of moving army corps with alternating activations of units during the turn. There is no CRT and units become progressively weaker during the battle.
For Wagram 1809, Laurent Martin has used an adaptation and evolution of the system he has already used for the battle of Bull Run and Cedar Creek, which appeared in Vae Victis.

The Island of D is in great danger. The Black Knight has seized the Dark Castle, and he wants to rule the island by chaos. The Black Knight seals the castle gate with a strong magic so no one can go in, and he prepare the Dark Ritual in the castles tower to open the portal to the dark world. Goblins, Orcs, and Goblorcs slowly spreading in the Island of D. The Black Knight just needs another 4 weeks to complete his ritual, to pour those creatures into the island. 
The village of Dew, the nearest village to the Dark Castle has called upon all heroes on the Island to defeat the Black Knight, since the Village Elder can help only one person a day enter the Dark Castles gate.

Hexes are 2000 yards and turns are 10 minutes.  Each player controls one or more ships, each of which have a Ship Systems Display (a la Star Fleet Battles or Car Wars).  The game contains statistics for most major classes of ships from Destroyer to Battleship from 1901 through WWII for several navies worldwide.  Ships are moved in impulses and may fire one or more weapons each impulse.  Hits are determined by dice, followed by checking armor penetration (which falls off by range).  If a hit penetrates, random ship systems are destroyed (rolled on a Damage Allocation Table).  Victory is by scenario.

Battlewagon was originally released as a Pocket Game in 1981.  It was later released in a Folio Second Edition in 1984.

345,Prairie Railroads,1999,7.02439,41,3,3,5,120,120,,Economic Trains ,Route/Network BuildingStock Holding,"from session report:

Action chits drive the game - on your turn you can play an action chit from your pool, or draw one from the cup and playing the drawn action.

Actions come in three flavours:

Offer Stock: a share stock is auctioned off. There are six companies, five shares per company. In order to make money you need shares in companies, then get those companies building crayon track across the laminated board. A very nice mechanic makes the money paid for the stock go into that company's coffers. It is these funds that the company must use to build track, so while you may get a bargin share for $1, that's not much use as it costs $5 to build a track segment. Very clever, and it certainly adds a twist to the old bidding mechanic.

Construct Track: a company's coffers are plundered for funds to build track. More track segments built, the more the payout per share when the next action is played.

Pay Dividend: each company pays the dividend bonuses to all shareholders. The total dividend is based on the value of towns connected by track, with bonus $1 for towns that experience growth. This total is divided by 5 (shares per company) then each shareholder receives this amount per share. A bit mathematical, but by keeping records as you go, it is pretty painless. As there are only 8 Pay Dividend chits in the game (well, 3 player game), it is a reasonably rare occurrence compared to the other two actions. 
The game ends when the 8th Pay Dividend is played, with a slightly different tweak on the final payouts.

Using the popular Zombicide system as a starting point, Massive Darkness adds all the richness of a dungeon crawl RPG. Pick your hero, choose a class, decide on which skills to spend your XP, and get loot by searching the dungeon or killing special enemies that can use the equipment against you! Face a multitude of different enemy types, coming in all shapes and sizes, whose behavior is resolved automatically...or you can try to sneak around enemies by taking advantage of dark areas of the map.

Players begin their adventure in Massive Darkness by picking a Hero  each with two special starting skills  and pair them with a Class of their choosing. Depending on the combination, another skill can be unlocked, giving players a wide range of choices and play styles. In Massive Darkness, the created Heroes go on Quests, killing monsters, collecting loot, and gaining XP. Players spend their XP to unlock new Skills, growing more powerful as the Quest progresses.

Throughout the game, players encounter different monsters, including Minions, Agents, Roaming Monsters, and Bosses. An unique mechanism of the game is the Guardian. Any of the monster types have a chance of spawning as a Guardian, meaning it will use a random piece of equipment in the fight against Heroes. However, if players are able to overcome this difficult encounter, they will acquire that piece of loot!

12067,Little Wars,1913,6.87083,48,2.6,2,12,90,90,Children's Wargames,Action / Dexterity Fighting Miniatures Wargame ,Simulation,"Little Wars was first published in 1913, but has been published many times since then, including editions from MacMillan publishing and Dover Press.  The rules portion of the book can be read for free online at http://www.gardenwargaming.com/wargame/sitemap.html.

The full book includes a fairly extensive history of the game and socio-political discussion of wargaming.  Wells (the famous historian and science fiction writer) was a pacifist, and the book makes for interesting reading, as wargaming was his favorite hobby.  He considered the generals he played with to be reckless buffoons, and was worried for his country should war break out.  (WWI broke out the year after the book was published, and given the massive casualties of WWI, he seems justified in his opinions.)

The rules themselves are fairly simple, as miniatures games go.  There are rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, terrain setup, prisoners, etc.  There are three types of units: cavalry, infantry and artillery.  The toy soldiers of Wells' day were fairly large, so the movement factors are also large, and it's made to be played on a floor.

Ranged combat results are entertaining, but hard to recreate in today's world.  In Wells' time, toy cannons fired little pellets and were actually tooled to be quite accurate.  The game calls for aiming the cannons and firing them, and any figures you knock over are casualties!  The best recreation I've seen was at a convention where we used toy pistols that fired plastic disks: the player had to place the butt of the pistol on the floor next to his artillery and fire from there.

Melee combat does not use a randomizer.  (In the book Wells discusses how he started with a coin flip but was turned against it when one soldier won over twenty battles!)  Instead, compare sizes of units, add in supporting units (within a certain distance), and each side takes casualties proportionately.  The remaining smaller force is then taken prisoner and may be escorted to the rear lines - or freed on the way by a rescue attempt.

Although modern miniatures rules are more complex and realistic, this is still a very fun game to play, and is a big hit at conventions.  It's also free online!  It is best played on a floor with one-foot tiles for ease of measurement.

The COHCCG was designed to be a quick game. Rather than using a turn structure where each player takes multiple actions in a row, the game used an alternating action structure. This lead to faster and more interactive games. Each player was represented by a Hero card, which began play with 2 starting powers. As their action, a player had many choices, including:


    Play a card, being:
         a Sidekick
         a Power that can be used by the Hero or a Sidekick
         an Enhancement on a Power already in play
         an Edge card with the keyword Action or React
    
    Activate a Power already in play
    Move the Hero or a Sidekick
    Search your draw deck for a Sidekick
    Recharge your Powers
    Play a Mission card
    Use the Defeat text on a mission to complete it
    Draw 2 cards


Unless otherwise specified by the cards played, play continued until only one Hero remained, who was declared the winner.

In addition to the 33 Heroes available in Arena and the 22 Heroes available in Secret Origins, players could create their own hero using Paragon Hero cards. These cards allowed a player to create new combinations of powers that were not available on existing Hero cards. Players could either play solely with the Paragon Hero cards available in the Arena set, or go online to access the HeroBuilder which allowed players to create Hero cards in the same template as the already available Heroes, including a picture uploaded by the player. Although the generic Hero cards listed all power sets available to the archetypes at the time, it wasn't until The Hamidon set was developed that many of those power sets were codified for use.

4842,Monster Derby,1994,6.13204,103,2.2857,2,10,120,120,,Fantasy Racing ,Variable Player Powers,"A race game between eight fantasy monsters selected at random from a deck of 25 (e.g., medusa, cyclops, vampire, zombie, centaur, dragon, griffin, djinni).  Players get secret agendas, listing the order they want the monsters to finish according to colored mover bases for the cards.

On each player's turn, they move a monster toward the finish line. All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).

A monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom wacky die shows sword or shield icons.

The game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.

The race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.

Note that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.  The original used regular dice, counters rather than cards, scored all eight finishers and had players set their own agendas (both of which stretched out the game considerably).

28944,Harzbahn 1873,2011,7.17917,36,4,2,5,300,300,Strategy,Economic Industry / Manufacturing Trains Transportation ,Auction/BiddingRoute/Network BuildingStock HoldingTile Placement,"1873 Harzbahn is an 18xx variant set in the Harz mountain range in northern Germany. It simulates not only the (narrow-gauge) railroads in that area, but also mines and other plants. Mining in the Harz mountains suffered a major crisis in the end of the 19th century and the theme of the game is to end this crisis by connecting the mines and other plants to the railroad network - and of course by proper management of the 7 public railroad companies, 15 private mining companies, and up to 5 public mining companies.

1873 has a bunch of fundamental differences from the usual 18xx game, which makes it one of the more distant members of the family (most prominent are the totally different systems of train operations, route determination, and revenue calculation).

---

The game presents an interesting dynamic. Mines are static and need rails to move product.

The game starts with 15 independent mines struggling with horse drawn delivery. Rails are just beginning to extend track through the difficult terrain with weak and puny engines hardly better then than horse drawn wagons.  What do you invest in? The rails or the mines?

Soon however some mines are connected and the profits begin to roll in. But not very efficiently for the mines as they are too fragmented and cannot get good prices for their product. The mines then join forces into mining companies. The mining companies pay better then the independent companies but have limited capital. Do you continue to reap Okay revenues or take it public. Public mining companies move quickly to acquire additional mines from their owners who reap huge profits.

New rail companies are also forming but have to struggle with purchasing routes and difficult terrain. But the mines need the track so once connected to the mines, they start turning a profit. But how do they protect their market or extend and try to expand to new markets?

Some may fail, overextended by mismanagement and greedy owners. Others with prudent management and extended routes can reap huge profits for the shareholders.

Each supply card shows one to three apples, carrots or nuts. During their turn, the active player can uncover in sequence up to four cards from the pile. If the same kind of fruit appears one after the other, then all cards uncovered in this turn are lost for the player. Since there are only three fruit sorts, this occurs regularly, so this provides tension both for children and adults.

If a player has more than six of a set, then he loses everything that he collected so far from this set.

If the player has exactly six pieces of a set, the player then receives a gopher trophy in exchange for the set. The first to get his third cup wins the game.

This game is not only pure gambling, but also offers tactical choices so children take part enthusiastically. The minimum age indicated by the manufacturer seems applicable as long as the child can count over six.

France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.

Complexity is rated as low, and solitaire suitability is medium.  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.

For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.

The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).
Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.

118177,Connections,2012,6.39529,70,1.7143,1,4,20,20,,Abstract Strategy Puzzle ,Tile Placement,"Kreuz  Quer is a Take it Easy-like puzzle game with players laying down tiles on a individual player grid to connect everything as well as they can.

Each player starts the game with 24 tiles showing various combinations of thick and thin pipe and a 5x5 player board that has a plus connection of pipes in the center square and numbered exit pipes on most of the edges. One player shuffles her tiles face down and will be the caller for the game.

The caller draws a tile, names the object on it (so that other players may locate the same tile), then each player places the tile on her own player board. A tile must be placed next to the midfield or to other tiles, and pipes must connect only to pipes of the appropriate width; exit pipes are considered to be both widths. Pipes can't connect to empty edges, and if you can't lay a tile (or don't want to), you can place it on the board face-down with the spiral back showing.

After all 24 tiles have been placed, players score points: 1 point for each spiral tile showing, and 1-3 points for each exit pipe not connected to the grid. The player with the fewest points wins!

Players start the game with their three pieces in the center of a 3x3 grid of tiles, with each tile divided into four spaces and each space showing an icon of some type (chocolate, sun, cookies, etc.) or an octagon or a portal. Players each start with three cards in hand, and the overall goal of the game is to collect 3-6 goal cards, with the exact number possibly changing during play.

On a turn, a player draws one card, plays one card, then moves one space, with all of those values being subject to change during gameplay; depending on what's currently allowed by the rules, you can also use movement points to rotate or move tiles in the play area. If you have a piece on each icon shown on the topmost goal card in play, you claim that card and are that much closer to winning. Players can also claim goal cards they have in hand by, again, placing their pieces on the appropriate icons. Other cards in the game allow players to change the rules, the game board, the ownership of player pieces, and so on.

The Hunnic empire has fallen and old empires are returning to power in the Mediterranean. Hordes of Nomads continue to invade Europe through the eastern steppe. They cross the rivers Rha, Tanais and Danapris to enter the lands of the Eastern Roman Empire, known as Byzantium. The settlers of the Slavic tribes are moving south from the northern forests and swamps. They will soon inhabit Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

Three young states have emerged: the Bulgarian Khanate, the Khazar Khaganate and Kievan Rus. They will struggle against each other and against the powerful Eastern Roman Empire for the right to exist and dominate the region.

Ruthenia is a classic two-level historical strategy game set in Eastern Europe in the 8th to 10th centuries.

You lead one of four states building fortresses, markets and temples, using fleets to trade, rob and transport troops, conquering new territories, commanding armies and conducting high politics.

In each battle, you lead your army personally. Cards are used to represent the soldiers lined up in medieval combat. Your army has four basic troop types  line infantry, heavy infantry, light cavalry and heavy cavalry  as well as support troops such as archers, garrisons and sailors. You can enhance the performance of your forces through the play of military action cards.

Rules govern the movement of non-player factions, including tribes and hordes as well as the states not taken by players.

175592,The Village Crone,2015,6.00556,162,2.625,1,6,90,90,,Fantasy ,Modular BoardWorker Placement,"Description from the publisher:

Become a witch and enter the medieval world of Wickersby in this worker placement, resource management game with spellcasting! Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.

All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.

The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)

The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.

The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.

At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.

The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.

Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.

When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.

The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.

Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.

The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.

This groundbreaking technology allows players to compete individually against the game and try to earn the highest score possible.

Three unique games can be played with Scrabble Flash. In the Flash game, players try to find as many three- to five-letter words as possible using the letters shown on the tiles. Five seconds are added to the play clock for every five-letter word formed. Five Letter Flash has players rushing to find the one five-letter word that uses the letters shown on the tiles. The game continues if the correct word is unscrambled. Play Scrabble Flash with a group in Pass Flash where players take turns forming five-letter words.

96765,CardFight!! Vanguard,2011,6.57022,89,2.8571,2,2,0,0,,Card Game Collectible Components Fantasy Fighting ,Hand Management,"ヴァンガード (Vanguard) is a Japanese trading card game published by Bushiroad. It was created in collaboration between Akira Itō (Yu-Gi-Oh! R), Satoshi Nakamura (Duel Masters), and Bushiroad president Takaaki Kidani. The game was also released in conjunction with a TV anime series, カードファイト!! ヴァンガード (Cardfight!! Vanguard).

In the game, players ride a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.

As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can drive check whereby they check the top card of their deck for triggers which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a damage check.

At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the vanguard circle and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a drive check or damage check.

Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:

1. Stand up (only at the start of the game, and both players perform this action simultaneously whereby they flip over their vanguard)
2. Stand and Draw
3. Ride
4. Call
5. Attack
6. Guard
7. Drive Check
8. Damage Check
9. (more attacks? Go back to 5)
10. Turn end - change to other player and go back to 2

It's worth noting that strategically, taking damage early in the game can be beneficial as you can use cards in the damage zone to counter blast (flip the cards over to activate special actions on certain units).

One player takes the role of Julius Caesar and controls the Roman forces, their Gallic allies and German mercenaries. The other player takes on the interests of those Gallic tribes trying to defend their independence.

Bellum Gallicum contains several independent scenarios and a campaign game which covers the whole of the Gallic Wars.

Each of the 9 scenarios covers one annual campaign in its historical context.

The campaign game covers the whole of the Gallic Wars and runs as a series of annual campaigns. For each of these the Gallic player may choose to lead a revolt or to remain at peace. Victory is decided by the accumulation of campaigns won by the Roman player. The game may however stop at any moment if the conditions for a decisive victory are met.

The present version of Bellum Gallicum is a development of the original game which appeared in Casus Belli, issues number 68 and 69 (1992). It contains new developments of the rules, in particular in those chapters covering combat.

Chaos Arena is a tactical simulation of armed conflict (war) made within the great tradition of classic two player beat-em-up board games like chess and hnefatafl, but set in fantasy world (quite possibly a disc).
Chaos Arena has, unlike the static and linear chess, a random factor added to it. This takes the form of dice, chaos cards and a choice of spells to alter the flow of the game. Because during conflict - just as in life - nothing is static and linear. And so, while playing, you'll have to learn to change your tactics to suit the altered conditions of the game as it progresses.

Following on the success of No Retreat! where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up yet again to present the third chapter in this game series, No Retreat 3: The French Front.

The Phony War ended in May of 1940 as the German Army unleashed blitzkrieg attacks into Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg in preparation for their audacious plan to invade France. Dubbed Case Yellow (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.

In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.

Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940? His research yields a resounding, Yes!, and the simulation elements of No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.

Game Data:

Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale
Solitaire Suitability: 3 on a 9 scale
Scale: Each unit is one army: The German forces or the Allied forces (French, British, and Neutrals) Each hex is about 30 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents four days of real time, except the first turn, which is only two days.

Players must protect their areas from the rampaging monster by deploying units of the national guard while at the same time evacuating tasty populace units.  As key production units in each sector are destroyed by Godran, the players resources dwindle.  Perhaps only a hastily-developed super weapon can save the day!

Players have many options in Oh No, There Goes Tokyo.  Each turn, their remaining production centers generate a number of Mega-Yen to be spent in a variety of ways.  First, players bid Mega-Yen to control Godran.  Each turn, Godran could be controlled by a different player.  Victory point incentives will keep Godran rampaging - but if you win the bidding, Godran will rampage someplace other than your back yard!

Mega-Yen can also be used to activate defense units, to evacuate panicked yet recalcitrant citizenry, and to develop super weapons to combat the mighty Godran.  Jury-rig a Death Ray and hope for a quick knockout punch, or undertake the longer and more expensive, but more sure-fire, process of researching Godrans origins to find his weakness. The Mega-Yen is an imaginary currency whose value, for the purposes of this game, is ridiculously high.

Oh No, There Goes Tokyo! plays essentially the same with two, three or four players.

Oh No, There Goes Tokyo! (Also known as ON,TGT!) contains a fold-out map that represents a hypothetical section of downtown Tokyo.  It could be any city, but Tokyo seems to be the most attractive to monsters.  Players are encouraged to substitute cities they particularly dislike if the urge strikes.  The game includes a set of counters representing Godran, destroyed buildings, the national guard in four colors and populace units in four colors.  Also included are a small selection of cards -  representing potential origin points for Godran and hair brained schemes to control the beast.  Relevant charts are included in the back of the rules for ease of access.  Play requires the use of multiple six sided dice to resolve combat and scrap paper for record keeping.

Its compact size makes it easy to put in your pocket and take it anywhere. Its simple rules make it easy to introduce new players to the genre of worker placement.

Players will use these mint tokens to earn more tokens, take first player or buy and build plans.

Plans are how players earn points. Some plans will only give points, others will give extra powers to the owner.

Once any player has at least 7 points earned (or if there are not enough plans to refill the stock) the end of the game is triggered. The game will then be over at the end of the current round.

Whoever has the most points provided by plans they have built wins!

The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.

Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.

Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. Optional rules include the politically charged issue that has reverberated down over the centuries, that many of the contingents of allies called in by Hungarian King Lajos did not arrive in time for the battle. Some were never going to do so; some were held back - specifically the charge leveled at Johann Szapolyai, Voivode of Transylvania because of his ambitions for the Hungarian throne (which he did get after Lajos' death and some deals reached with Suleiman).

The story of Lineage II : The Boardgame precedes the original Lineage by far. It goes long back before the history of the usurpation and the revenge between the rightful heir Deforge and the usurper Ken Rauhel. The age of the mighty Titans has ended. The human who are the most prosperous, the noble elves who protect nature, the strong orcs who worship power, the evil dark elves who are driven by vengeance, and the dwarves who are the skillful tradesmen - these five races compete to dominate the world. You will become one of them in this game. Although they want different things, their paths are already laid out by the fate. It is the way of becoming the strongest in this world of grave adventures, glorious victories, oaths of blood and evil treacheries; in order to leave your footsteps in this time of war and chaos.


Lineage II : The Boardgame is based on a simple roll and move mechanism, played on a small hex map. Players move around the board to hunt monsters, hire mercenaries and fight castle sieges. VPs are collected by winning siege battles. The first player with 10 VPs will become the victor.

There are thousands of games - virtual spaces, in which people willingly spend time... or their entire life. A shadow looms over this digital utopia in the form of hacker attacks. The only ones able to defend the sensory worlds are Gamedecs: hardboiled private detectives specializing in the mysteries of the virtual worlds. Become one of them and investigate cases in sensory worlds, gather clues and equipment, conduct corporate investigations and cross them or cooperate with them. Watch out though - your reputation is your ticket to better jobs. But beware - every passing second leads closer to a total crash of the virtual net.

Gamedec is an adventure game themed around Martin Ann's Gamedec novels. Players try to solve cases connected to the global hacker attacks. Each player choose one from 10 available game-detectives and, during the course of the game, upgrade his/her character by collecting equipment cards, acquiring skills (which helps solving cases) and improving reputation (which provides more case-cards). The game ends either when one of the characters collects enough clues to stop the hackers, or when the Net is too damaged and need to be shut down (all players lose).

The vampire is invisible, so there's no vampire pawn, but he IS somewhere on the map. The only clues are from radars. When a human uses a radar, the humans get to know how far the vampire is from the radar. With the clue from the radar and guessing his moves, humans shoot their guns blindly, trying to damage the vampire.

Before all bullets are spent or all humans are killed, if the vampire's life is reduced to zero, the humans win. The vampire wins when he kills all the humans or when the humans are out of bullets.

The second edition of Vampire Radar has nine 2x2 tiles instead of 36 1x1 tiles, making for faster set-up, and it includes variant rules for the human players. Instead of each human player taking two actions, then the vampire acting twice, each human player takes one action, then they pass the starting marker clockwise, then each human takes another action, then the vampire acts. This change rotates the turn order among the humans.

Game play is the same as the classic board game except for a few interesting twists:

 When you attack an opponents piece, the computer tells you whether you have won, lost, or tied.  So you do not know the exact strength of the opposing piece, only its strength relative to your own piece (and so too your opponent does not know the exact strength of the piece you used to attack with).  This feature makes the game quite a bit more interesting than standard Stratego.

 Instead of moving one of your pieces on your turn, you can probe an opposing piece to find its strength.  You will not be given its exact strength, but instead what class it is in (8-9, 5-7, or all else)

 Bombs are no longer playing pieces but are hidden features on your side of the board that are programmed into the game.  You secretly select six spaces in which to place the bombs.  Your own pieces can move through these spaces unharmed, but any enemy pieces (except a Miner) landing on these spaces will be destroyed!

 Scouts can move and strike diagonally, and can strike from a distance.

The player who finds and captures his opponent's flag first wins the game.

In recent years, the Sun has become increasingly unstable, to the point where experts claim it could go supernova at any moment. The various inhabitants of the planets in this solar system are launching one last effort to save themselves, which involves building a final Ark to propel a small selection of their people into deep space. This requires a great deal of energy, and in a final ironic twist, the only source of such great energy is the dying star itself. In the process of extracting and transmitting the energy required to save themselves, they will be compounding the instability of the Sun and hastening the end of their worlds.

Sol:  Last Days of a Star is a board game for two to five players where each player represents a different planetary effort to transmit as much energy from the Sun back to their Ark as they can to escape the solar system before the Sun explodes!

The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core).  The deeper you go, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased.  Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Harvest stations, and you use this energy to either activate Build stations to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit stations to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into solar Bridges which span the high energy membranes separating one layer from the next.

You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever.   With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!

On a turn, all of the characters on one team act first, one after another, then the opposite team goes. During your turn, use your action points to move your character and search on the island. If you meet someone from the other team, you can fight them, whether to steal the treasure or simply to set them back. When you search, you might find move and fight tokens to save for the future; flags that let you claim a dock on the island to make it easier to leave; or clues to the treasure. The clue tokens let you play cards, and those cards determine where the treasure will be found  ideally in a spot more advantageous for you than the other team.

Once the final clue has been found, the treasure is up for grabs, with a team needing to have one of its characters possess it on a dock to which they have access at the start of their turn. Thus, holding it isn't enough as the other team can possibly steal it away on their turn.

Depending on the challenge, you get between one and eight dice to roll. Some challenges are single-player, some allow you to challenge an opponent, and some include every player. Different challenges give you three rolls of the dice, or one, or an unlimited number to attempt your challenge. Various cards let you set dice aside and re-roll the remaining ones--while some cards dictate that you only get a single roll. If the dice don't go your way, you can cash in your chips for an extra roll, an extra turn, or perhaps a new card.  The player that successfully completes their challenges--while wisely using their chips and re-rolls--is crowned the Combo King.

It is played with 35mm miniatures and uses a system that relies on rolling 10-sided dice to determine results.  Players adopt a faction (such as Union, outlaws, and native Americans) and build their forces with a pool of points dependent on the scenario played.  A mechanic of the game allows players to use Influence tokens (generated by their forces) to re-roll dice.  The game's objectives are dependent on the scenario played and can include killing off all your opponents' forces or having the largest force (in terms of cost) at the end of 6 turns.

Those characters often take the human form with wings and we call them Guardian Angels or RAGAMI.

In this game, each player will play the role of a RAGAMI, winged human form, that travels around inside a city - the board. In this city, there are always people with problems, with their own internal conflicts, that need your help. There are also holy men and demons that can help or oppose to solving these conflicts.

The objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible number of Virtue Points (VP). There are several ways to get VP, and consequently there are several strategies one can follow to win the game: solve conflicts, cause demons to disappear, help other RAGAMI, to be the RAGAMI who has solved the highest number of conflicts, etc.

But helping people to solve their conflicts is what worths more VPs, and for this you need to have Points of Strength. As many as the strength of the conflict you're trying to solve, which can go from 1 to 6. There are several ways to get Points of Strength: white cubes, cards, holy men, the help of another RAGAMI, or a die.

There are Action Dies (which allow to execute a certain number of actions, and it's placement will be made by the last player in the turn order) and there are Action Cards (that may be acquired during the game). In his play, Player can do one of the following actions: move his RAGAMI, move the holy men and the demons, pick cards or solve conflicts.

Game ends in the turn when the places of conflicts ends or when a player hit's the 30 points score mark.

180599,Sly Dice,2015,6.88909,55,2,2,4,45,45,,Bluffing Dice Party Game ,Dice RollingSet Collection,"Sly Dice is a dice game in which you want to get as many points as possible by scoring various dice combinations. However, you can also bluff about having those combinations and hope that others will not call on you. At the end the player with the most points wins the game.

Each player has three dice, a shield and tokens for marking. There are several combination cards in the middle of the table as well as three common dice that will be used by all players. In each round the starting player rolls the middle dice and then all players also have up to three rolls for their own dice, which are rolled behind player's shield. However, if you want to make a roll after your first one, you have to set one die aside, visible to other players. However, if you roll three times your last roll must remain behind the shield - thus each player will have at least one die that is not visible to others.

When everyone is done with rolling, all players claim, which of the visible combinations they have. The trick is - you can also lie and try to claim a combination, which you don't have. When a player has claimed a combination then all other players in clockwise order have a chance to either accuse him of lying or pass.

1) If everyone passes then the player scores this combination and receives the points it provides. If he lied and didn't have this combination he can now reveal this fact to others - he still scores the combination as if he had it and he also receives one Successful Liar's card, which gives extra points.

2) If anyone accuses the player of lying, then he has to reveal his dice, which creates two possibilities:

If he was not lying then he scores the combination, but the player who accused him takes a False Accusation card, which gives minus points. However, if he was lying then he was accused correctly and doesn't get to score the combination, effectively losing his turn. The accuser doesn't get anything apart from the good feeling that he didn't let the lie slip through.

Thus each player in a round claims one combination. At the end of the round you add a new combination card from the draw pile and begin a new round. After certain number of rounds you tally up the score and the winner is the player with most points.

One player plays the Japanese Army and the other plays the Chinese KMT troops. The game is 13 turns long.

Simulates the most famous battle of the Second Sino-Japanese war 1937-1945 which the Japanese 10th division with 25,000 fanatical and well trained and equipped men and backed up by large numbers of tanks, armored cars, artillery and planes drove towards the town of Taierzhuang to pave the way for the conquest of the city of Xuzhou. The Japanese are opposed by the KMT 2nd Army group  20th Army consisting of 100,000 brave and tenacious soldiers with no tanks, little artillery and some aircraft defending behind heavy fortifications and trenches.

The battle eerily resembles the Battle of Stalingrad 4 years later and it is said that General Chuikov's tactics at Stalingrad was inspired by this battle (Chuikov was an military adviser to Jiang Jie Shi (Chang Kai Shek) in 1940.

The system used is a modified Storm Over Arnhem/Stalingrad system with added stuff like initiative, random events, tactical chit play etc.

But the players aren't working collaboratively  no, they want to make strong color connections for their own glory.

One player starts with a yellow tile, the other with a red tile. Twenty-one other tiles have some combination of red, blue and yellow on them, with each corner being a solid color. One tile is placed randomly on the table as a starting tile, and the other tiles are randomly distributed between the two players.

On a turn, a player adds one tile to the layout. The tile must be adjacent to at least one tile already on the board, and the colors of the just-placed tile must match all adjacent tiles, even if they touch only at a corner. The player scores points by adding to colored areas already on the board; he scores one point for each tile in a colored area that he adds to, while scoring no points for the tile just placed. (The starting player begins with five points.)

A player must add a tile to the layout on his turn, discarding a tile instead if one can't be placed. After all tiles have been placed or discarded, the player with the most points wins.

One source reports that it was the 8th edition which added sections on Quadrille, Piquet, and Backgammon; with the 11th edition adding Chess. At least 20 different versions of Hoyle's have been published over the years, making it the best-selling series of books about games in history and giving rise to the popular phrase, according to Hoyle.

The title page of an edition published around 1900 reads as follows:

Hoyle's Games. America's Complete Hand-Book of Games, containing all the card games played in the United States, with their rules, regulations, technicalities, etc., adapted to the American mode of playing, from the text of Hoyle, and the best modern authorities. Also comprising Backgammon, Chess, Checkers, Billiards, Pool, Bagatelle, Bowls, etc., with numerous diagrams and engravings. Complete edition. Revised, corrected, and enlarged.

One confusing aspect about this book is that there is no trademark on the name Hoyle (just like there is no trademark on the name Webster's for dictionaries), so referring to a book as Hoyle's Games could refer to a number of different volumes.  The popular Hoyle's Games was first published in 1907, with at least ten editions published in the twentieth century.  Each edition added to, edited, and clarified what had been presented in the earlier edition.

Shuffle the deck of cards, place them in the circle, then reveal the top card, thereby showing the animal that players will search for in the first round. Place 1-4 tokens in the circle to account for the animals of this type that aren't visible. (Two cards show woodland elves instead of an animal, and the plaeyr who draws this card chooses which animal players will search for.)

On a turn, a player flips over one of the discs to reveal the animal shown on the other side. If the player reveals the target animal, she earns one token from the circle; if the player reveals the fourth animal of this type, the player takes the final token, along with the animal card. Once all four animals of the desired type are visible, reveal the next card. Once all twelve cards have been used, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. Each token and animal card is worth one point, while the two elf cards are worth two points each.

Game play in Taiga is nearly identical to that of Findevier, with the differences being (1) that the game has only ten animal cards and no elf cards; (2) that a player who reveals an incorrect animal must return a token to the bank; and (3) that each token is worth one point and each animal card is worth two points.

These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.
   
This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.

This is the last event to enter the guild of magicians. It remains the ultimate lesson to master: the invocation of Gigamons. After this test, one that will catch more Gigamons be promoted to Elemage. Good luck and good luck to all!

Aim of the game
Find the pairs Elemons to the exchange against Gigamons.

Setting up of the game:

1-Mix all the Elemons tiles face down and create a 3 by 3 square!
2-Place the 7 Gigamons and the Rocks tiles on the side of the play area.
3-The remaining Tiles of Elemons form the deck.

How to play?

    The youngest begins.
    In turn, each player returns 2 face tiles.
        If the tiles are different, the player puts the face down (Polymon always forms a pair with any elemon)
        If the tiles are identical, the player wins and triggers the power the Elemon that is drawn (see specials ability of each Elemons. Then he replaces them 2 tiles from the deck without looking at them.
    




If a player has 3 identical Elemons, it can put them back in the box to catch the Gigamon associate. If an opponent already has this Gigamon, he can steal it.
Then it was the turn of the next player.

Elemon powers:


     Polymon: Functions as a wild, always forming a pair with any elemon.
     Floramon: The player takes a tile from the top of the draw pile and adds it to their group of tiles.
     Aeromon: Swap one of the tiles in front of you with a tile in front of another player. The player who gets the ability gets to choose which tiles are swapped.
     Pyromon: Choose a tile in front of another player and remove it from the game.
     Hydromon: While everyone else closes their eyes, look at four of the tiles in the 3X3 grid and then turn them back over.
     Geomon: Place a rock tile on one of the tiles in the 3X3 grid. No player may pick up the tile underneath the rock until the player who played it takes their next turn.
     Electromon: The player gets an extra turn.


End of the game
The game ends in 2 ways:

    When a player has caught 3 Gigamons;
    When the Elemons tiles deck is empty.




Who win the game?

Who ever has the most Gigamons is  promoted to Elemage!
In case of tie, who ever has the most Elemons wins.
In case of a tie, all tied players are  promoted to Elemages.

1593,Down with the King,1981,5.75514,393,3.098,2,6,120,120,Strategy Thematic,Card Game Fantasy Negotiation Political ,Role Playing,"Down With The King is a political game set in a fantasy world.

Players are nobles who plot to overthrow the king. Players must cooperate to defeat the king, but only one of them can take the crown thus backstabbing is always a concern.  The game is played through various decks of cards.  Players strive to gain prestige and influence points so that they can recruit characters to their side.  They also use natural disasters, plagues, interrogations, and other political problems against their opponents. Of 19 possible actions each turn, a player can only perform 2, thus creating a tension and need for strategy. Player interaction is very high because players can perform actions during opponent turns and because nobody is eliminated early from the game. A player who is killed just misses a turn and then returns as the former player's heir, usually with revenge in mind.

55031,Grand Slam,2014,6.40128,78,1.25,2,4,30,30,,Card Game Sports ,Card DraftingHand ManagementSimulation,"In Grand Slam, originally titled Love Means Nothing, each player has a deck of 24 cards, each of which depicts two parts of a tennis court: One half-court can be used for defense, returning a ball that comes your way; the other half-court can be used for offense, sending a shot across the net. You never use both halves of the card at once  either one or the other.

A turn consists of first playing a card to cover the shot your opponent played, then playing another card to dictate which of the six zones you'll hit the ball to. Finally, you play a preparation card, indicating which zones you're prepared to cover. The preparation card can be used to cover a shot if the appropriate zone is highlighted; otherwise you must cover the shot with a card from your hand, in which case the preparation card becomes the attack. Thus, by playing cards that your opponent cannot cover with her preparation card, you maintain control of the match because you'll see from where the next attack will come and will be able to prepare for that. Of course if a player cannot cover a shot at all, then the point is lost.

Combinations of cards can create special shots, which if not covered by the corresponding combination of cards, leave a player off balance, with her drawing only one card at the end of the turn instead of the usual two. This will leave her with fewer options and make it less likely that she'll cover your shots.

130907,Jungle Brunch,2012,6.08517,118,1.75,2,5,20,20,,Animals Card Game ,Hand ManagementSimultaneous Action Selection,"In the card game Jungle Brunch, everybody is very hungry, so what food can you ﬁnd for your animals? You need to ﬁnd the tastiest food, but watch out for dangerous predators that hope to eat you! Play your cards carefully, escape from the tigers, and keep an eye on the sky in case a vulture is watching you  after all, little animals make a great dessert!

Each player has an identical deck of 22 animal cards; at the start of the game, players shuffle their decks, then draw six cards as a starting hand. Someone shuffles the plant deck, then lays out plants until at least one (regular or famine) card is available for each type of plant and at least 3-7 plant cards are available (with the number depending on the number of players).

Each turn the starting player lays down two cards  one face-up and the other face-down  then each other player does the same. Players then reveal all their cards and work their way down the food chain: Bats attack herbivores, weakening them and making them eat more slowly; snakes scare away the strongest animal; elephants, tigers, buffaloes and monkeys then eat (one card) in order of their strength, from high to low; elephants eat nuts, or bananas if no nuts remain; tigers eat the highest-valued buffalo or monkey; buffaloes eat herbs, then bananas; monkeys eat anything but prefer bananas; warthogs eat last but consume two items; the animal young copy the animal they're played with and eat at the same time; vultures feed on buffaloes and monkeys that are forced to eat famine cards  or any such animal that fed. (They're not that choosey, really.) Animals can also be played in matching pairs, which prevents them from being eaten but restricts them to only one food card.

After the round ends, each player draws two more animal cards from his deck, the plant selection is replenished, then a new round begins, with the player who ate first in the previous round playing first now. As soon as players have only four cards in hand or the plant selection can't be refilled, the game ends, and the player with the most food points wins!

164760,Goblin's Breakfast,2015,7.33553,76,1.4615,2,6,15,15,Family Party,Card Game Fantasy ,,"It's a well known fact that Goblins are aggressive nasty little brutes, and that bigger goblins ALWAYS pick on smaller ones. It's also a well-known fact that the only way to get to BE a bigger goblin is to eat a good breakfast.  This makes breakfast in the Goblin Warren a highly competitive and somewhat dangerous meal...

In this card game, players take the role of Goblins at the Breakfast table, scrambling to eat as much food as possible and to prevent other players from doing the same.

Illustrated by Travis Hansen, the game plays from 2 to 6 players, (more with multiple decks.)  It takes about 5 minutes to learn, and 15 minutes to play.  It includes about 60 cards.

To start the game, a few cards are dealt out to the center table, and on each turn, players can do one of the following four things.

A, They can take a food or weapon from the center of the table.
B, If they have a bigger weapon than another player, they can steal another card from another player's hand.
C, If they have a food card in hand they can eat it, scoring it.
D, They can play a special action card from the center of the table, immediately playing its effects.

The result is a fast-paced, light-hearted arms race, with quickly shifting strategy and chaotic fun.  After the deck runs out, the player that eats the most food wins!

It should be noted that this game was a finalist for the 2014 Ion Awards at the SaltCon board game convention in Salt Lake City.

The new harbour game Antwerpen is a stand alone new boardgame with some specific game mechanics which differ from Rotterdam. The game play is more compact and dynamic and the variance in scoring is more diverse.

Belgians are worldwide known to enjoy life, thanks to the delicious products of their fatherland. The best chocolate, beer of high fermentation and of course the real Flemish French fries. But without cocoa no pralines, without potatoes no fries! In the Antwerp port the necessities for an enjoyable life are brought together from all parts of the world: cocoa, barley and potatoes, but also containers filled with games and toys.

The players are owners of a fleet who must compete on the busy channels in the Schelde. They need to find their way in the network of locks and bring their cargo safe in the inland harbour! Each player has several special assignments which they try to accomplish. The planning in Antwerpen is easier than in Rotterdam since the product cards available are visible from the beginning. And also exchanging products could be very helpful to get the right combination of products needed to score your bonus points.

					Introduction

In Mr. Card Game, you are Mr. Card Game, cousin to the (internet) famous Mr. Adventurer, the hero of the Kingdom of Loathing. Mr. Card Game is a rule-breaking, cross-classing monster killer on a tabletop quest to free King Ralph XI from the Naughty Sorceress. As you and your fellow tabletop adventurers chart a course through the Kingdom of Loathing, whoever buys the right skills, acquires the best stats and can take down the Naughty Sorceress first wins the game and the right to lord it over his or her friends (friends not included with game).

				
					Description

Mr. Card Game is the official tabletop game of the massive multiplayer online game Kingdom of Loathing. With a mixture of deck-building mechanics and tableau management, Mr. Card Game is a fantasy adventure themed character building card game for 2 to 5 players ages 13 and up which plays in less than an hour.

				
					Synopsis

Each player begins with a deck of one point stats and a set of basic newbie gear. On your turn, you have the opportunity to select one of the monsters on top of the location draft piles to kill. By defeating a monster, you receive a new item (displayed on the reverse side of the monster card) to add to your tableau, a new stat card to add to your deck and meat tokens you can use on subsequent turns to draft skills. Once one or more of the players thinks they have accumulated enough power from killing monsters, upgrading stats and training skills to defeat the Naughty Sorceress, they may call a March of the Tower where all players have an opportunity to kill her together. They player with the highest power and enough to kill the Sorceress, wins.

				
					Strategy

The gameplay in Mr. Card Game is a hybrid of deck building and tableau management. Mr. Card Game is a game of drafting, not only drafting items and skills, but also the stat cards necessary to use those items and skills most effectively. You want to plot a course through the locations in the game which maximizes the synergy of the skill and item cards you draft into your tableau with the stat cards you draft into your deck. All the while managing your level of meat, the currency of the realm you acquire from killing monsters, which you need to purchase the skills which make you better. Tactically, the game relies upon your management of your tableau, when to use or sell items, and how effectively you craft the hand of cards necessary to defeat your target or perhaps even win the game.

One player controls the Ottoman forces along with other Central Power units. The other player controls the various Allied contingents. TOTO has been designed by Joseph Miranda.

The concept and exploitation of victory points is central to play of the game. Players begin with a designated number of victory points, which they may keep, or expend them to gain reinforcements and execute other actions. Players gain new victory points as a result of achieving their strategic objectives. Players lose victory points when they suffer losses in combat. To win, you must have more victory points than your opponent; so play becomes a competitive balancing act between attaining new objectives without spending too many of your previously earned victory points to do it.

Each player has a range of unit types available: infantry, cavalry, expeditionary combined arms forces, early mechanized units, air and naval, as well as guerrillas and the major personalities of the era, such as Lawrence of Arabia. Logistics are also critical, as players utilize supply units to enhance their movement and combat capabilities.

The 34x22 large-hex map covers from Mecca and Medina north through Mesopotamia to the Caucasus, west to the Nile Delta, east to Persia, and northwest to Adrianople, at 87 miles per hex. Each game turn equals a quarter of a year.

There are 280 half-inch, NATO-style (and some iconic), unit-counters. Units of maneuver are primarily divisions, but numerous corps, brigades, regiments and battalions are also included in the orders of battle.

There are two short scenarios, one early war and one late war, along with a full campaign game. The rules run to approximately 15,000 words; so two experienced players can finish the campaign game in about six hours.

Each player builds 2 different subway lines, trying to go through the city and connect important places of housing, work, and leisures. After a construction phase, trip-tests verify the best and quickest lines.

The mechanism is easy: during his turn, a player puts 3 line counters on the board. If his line meets another line, a station is built where the two connect. The subway network is developed through this process. Because the grid on the board and the line counters are triangular, players have some real placement questions.

The game is very interactive, with players sometimes trying to cooperate and sometimes trying to stop other lines. They also choose, during the construction phase, the start and the end of the final trip-tests. But it's never the same player who places both start and end, so a player must anticipate and guess carefully.

The first product in our development cycle is the currently-in-playtest Campaign Game. What is a campaign? Simply put, its a chance to play an entire race (not just a ship or fleet) and conduct an entire war one step at a time. Youll colonize planets, manage resources, build ships, capture territory, and negotiate with your neighbors. The ultimate aim of a campaign can be as straightforward as galactic dominance. Although this can be achieved in other ways such as accomplishment of a set of predefined victory conditions.

VBAM has been designed in such a way that you can use any background setting for your campaign. The primary goal of the master book is to provide the basic structure and rules to handle campaign-level issues. The campaign guide is designed to offer the players a variety of choices in complexity and style of play. It can be played by itself as a stand alone game using our quick space and ground combat resolution system with the included source materials or used with more complex tactical combat systems with source materials that you already own.

Grande Arme is a set of rules by which players can use miniature figures of any size or basing system to recreate the famous, large-scale battles of the Napoleonic wars. In wargame parlance, it is grand-tactical in scope, in that players command entire armies, moving whole corps and divisions on the table. The basic unit on the table-top is the brigade, representing a few thousand soldiers. At this scale, of course, many things are abstracted. We do not concern ourselves with the actions of small groups of soldiers. Rather, we place ourselves in the roles of generals, ordering thousands of men to move, attack, or defend. And, like those generals of history, we don't know whether or not our officers and men are going to behave exactly as we hope or expect.

18835,Credit Mobilier,2005,6.03182,121,2.1,2,5,60,60,,Economic Trains ,Dice RollingStock HoldingTrading,"During the building of the transcontinental railroad, the owners of the Union Pacific Railroad Company set themselves up as the owners of a construction company  the Credit Mobilier. They proceeded to award themselves fat contracts, paid for by the U.S. Congress, to construct their own railway.

In Credit Mobilier, four fictional railways race to construct track and move goods westward while the players invest in the railways and the Credit Mobilier.

User review: There are five railroads; each of a different color. Four of the railroads have fifteen shares of stock, a treasury card, ten railroad tracks, and several blocks. The fifth railroad, Credit Mobilier, only has the stock and treasury card. The game board represents the United States. One block is put on each of the cities randomly. Each player begins the game with three dollars and a share of Credit Mobilier stock. A start player is randomly chosen and the game begins.

In turn, each player will roll the five dice. The player will then choose to lay track (which adds to the Credit Mobilier treasury), move freight (which may add to the treasury of the railroad that owns the freight and traversed upon track), buy stock of one railroad (if available) for one dollar each, or pay dividends to the owners of the shares of one company.

A players options are limited to which colors are rolled on the dice. Rolling orange is the only color that lets one pay dividends. Purple represents Credit Mobilier and it is also wild but it can only be used as a duplicate of any color rolled except orange.  
Players take turns in clockwise order until there are blocks of two colors which have yet to be transported to the Pacific Coast wherein the game ends immediately. The player with the most cash on hand is the winner.

96157,No Retreat 2,2011,7.4,33,2.7143,2,2,50,50,,Wargame World War II ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenDice RollingHex-and-Counter,"The African Front: 1940 - 1942

Deluxe Series #5

Following on the success of No Retreat! where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up again to present the second chapter in this game series, No Retreat 2: North Africa, this time taking the action to the African Front from the start of Operation Compass on 8 December 1940, through 1942 to the eviction of the Axis from Libya.

Building on the notion of a card assisted game and death-or-glory victory conditions, No Retreat 2 offers a narrative game rich in the feel for the ebb-and-flow of the campaign, wrapped around an exciting maneuver and combat system that harks back to the glory days of classic wargaming but includes all the modern features and plenty of innovations. Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 mini-maps located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating mini-games in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.

The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.

The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.

The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake. You must endure and prevail under the most surprising and grueling of circumstances, for there is No Retreat!

ON 6 JUNE 1944 the greatest armada the world has ever seen approached northern France. That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germanys veteran Wehrmacht.

ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourgs fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.

There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.

This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set thats been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.

The theme is horses racing in a steeplechase.  Each round represents a fence that the horses must jump.

Players bet and then place speed cards on each horse.  When all of the horses have a speed card on them, the one with the lowest speed card is eliminated.  When there are three horses left (which happens after 5 rounds), the players are paid for their bets on the surviving horses.  Earlier bets are worth more.

The game in each case is essentially similar to Titan: the Arena except:
-  There are no special powers, nor special cards.
-  The deck goes to 0-9, not 0-10.
-  There are no secret bets.
-  In four or five player games, each player gets 4 bets.
-  If there is a tie for lowest card when a round ends, the tied horse furthest on the left is eliminated.  (Play does NOT continue as it does in Titan: the Arena or G:tDA)

Stalemate on the Brussels Road

The crossroads of Quatre-Bras was of strategic importance because the side which controlled it could move south-eastward along the Nivelles-Namur road towards the French and Prussian armies at the Battle of Ligny. If Wellington's Anglo-Allied army could combine with the Prussians, the combined force would be larger than Napoleon's. Napoleon's strategy had been to cross the border into the Netherlands without alerting the Coalition and drive a wedge between their forces and subsequently to defeat the Prussians before turning on the Anglo-Allied army. Although the coalition commanders did have an overview of French pre-war movements, Napoleon's strategy was initially very successful.

The battle cost Ney 4,000 men to Wellington's 4,800. Although a tactical draw, the allies had been unable to send forces to the aid of the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny. Wellington's Anglo-Allied army, upon learning of the Prussian defeat, was forced to retreat north along the Brussels road further away from the Prussians, who retreated north-east towards Wavre.

There has been much debate of what would have happened if d'Erlon's I Corps had engaged at either Ligny or Quatre Bras. As he did not, Napoleon chose to follow Wellington with the bulk of his forces, and two days later met his destiny at Waterloo.

Quatre Bras is part of the Napoleon's Last Battles Quadrigame.  It was also sold separately as a folio game.

Folio version includes rules, a 17 x 22 map and 100 counters.

World War Two was the company commander's war, the front-line infantry or rifle company being the basic unit of tactical maneuver. Battlefront:WWII is designed to model this tactical level of combat. The basic organization used is the maneuver element, usually a company sized formation of units fighting as a group. In Battlefront:WWII each player takes command of one or more maneuver elements. A game involving several players recreates tactical actions between opposing battalion or regimental sized forces and can be finished in a single evening.

* Each miniature or stand represents a squad of men, specialized team, or 2-3 vehicles or guns.
    * Each game turn represents approximately 10 minutes of real time.
    * The rules are designed so that each player can handle one or two maneuver elements (a maneuver element is roughly a company).
    * Units of up to battalion size can be handled comfortably by experienced players.
    * Although designed for 15mm miniatures, play aids and rules allow miniatures from 5mm (1/285) to 20mm to be used comfortably.

Battlefront:WWII began life as a training aid for the Army in the 1980's. The rules are not only easy to play and fun, but also historically accurate. Poor tactics or 'gamey' gambits will quickly fail. Players who learn how to combine the strengths and capabilities of their units will be effective on the battlefield.

However, the police also has sent a team of undercover agents to infiltrate the triad. Ten years later, they are still undercover, but their minds have been twisted by the temptation of power, authority and money  and nobody is certain about their original roles anymore. Both groups learn that they have been infiltrated and want to ferret out the moles. Each mole has a secret code to lock their identity file, and once the code is cracked their identity is fully revealed. The battle of wits starts now. Either exposing the enemy or taking the chance to change the identity for good can save their lives as long as nobody knows who is who!

Internal Affairs is an intense elimination game between infiltrators from both the Triad and the Police Force Infiltrator. Each player has a set of secret ID cards which determine that player's allegiance. Each player also has a secret code, which when cracked reveals the player's real ID. At the beginning of the game, each player has five code cards and chooses three of them to be the secret code that locks the identity file. During their turn, players try to crack other players' codes to find out who is who and get their team to victory. Due to action cards, though, ID cards may be passed from player to player and this may change each player's allegiance. Players must be quick to win, as otherwise they may end up in the losing team when they least expect it.

Internal Affairs is designed for 5-8 players, but alternative rules have been included to allow for play with 2-4.

72200,Red Dragon / Green Crescent,2012,7,41,2.25,1,2,180,180,,Modern Warfare Wargame ,Area MovementDice Rolling,"Red Dragon/Green Crescent (RDGC) is a strategic-level, intermediate-complexity wargame, with operational undertones, covering hypothetical future conflicts around the southern and eastern peripheries of Asia. The timeframe is the near future, between 2013 and 2021. The game has been designed by Bruce Costello using the CSR Award winning system that first appeared in Strategy  Tactics no. 250. Its adaptable for two player, multi-player and solitaire play.

RDGC expands the original game into a two-mapper covering the Indian Ocean and Middle East, areas strategic to both the US and its allies and the Peoples Republic of China and its allies.
In the game, Chinese forces that may be initially deployed into the Indian Ocean area are few, but they also have one solid ally at start: Myanmar. Besides Myanmar, there are other question marks for US planners. For instance, would Pakistan stand idly by if India allied with the US, given the existential threat they perceive of a US-Indian victory in a war with China? And what about Iran: if that country is ever to make a move to achieve dominance in the Persian Gulf, what better time than during a major war while its winners arent yet clear? Theres also the rest of the troubled Middle East (Egypt-Syria-Lebanon-Israel). That collective totality makes for a wonderfully varied gaming situation. Besides the main scenarios, there are numerous variants and options, adding new dimensions and giving literally hundreds of new possibilities for play.

Most of the ground units in RDGC represent brigades (brigade combat teams or BCT for the US). The exceptions are the Singaporean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, Philippine, and Yemeni armies. There is additionally one new corps of marines for the PRC. Aircraft are mostly represented by mixed-type combat-wings, though only one aircraft type is shown on each counter. Long-range bombers have their own mono-type units that cant combine operations with the other tactical air wings. Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groups of vessels such as SAGs, subrons or individual capital ships.

Game turns represent varied amounts of real time, depending on the operation presently being conducted, from one to three days. An entire match encompasses the first month of the wars being examined. Scenarios include partial and two-map games, some centered on the Korean peninsula, others on the Indo-Pakistan area, and others taking in the entire, huge, arcing region from the Red Sea to Alaska.

This special edition includes 2 maps (22x34 inches) and 352 counters.

Anno Domini: Wissenschaft  Forschung focuses on historical events related to science and research. Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.

In Anno Domini: Wissenschaft  Forschung, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.

If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player  who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement  receives three cards. The first player with no cards remaining in hand wins.

On your turn you are moving two of the characters on the board (could be yours and/or the others). Movement is decided by dice (you chose which dice you use for each character you chooses to move).

The game is won when either everyone is out of the mansion or when the last card (Clock Strikes Midnight) is drawn from the deck. You win by having the most moneybags (of the 20 available) of any of the players.

You are always trying to knock off the other heirs because as they are gone, their moneybags move down the will to the next heir in line. The board is a 3D house with several traps, which you use to get rid of the other heirs.

You can bluff by moving your opponents' characters towards the entrance or moving your own character onto the trap spaces, but without releasing it.

In Drachenhort, players don't represent these adventurers themselves, but rather secretly back a trio of these adventurers. Each turn, the active player rolls a die and moves one of the adventurers further away from the dragon. After all of the adventurers have moved once, all of them are available for movement once again. Don't be too obvious about which adventurers you support, though, for others will drop traps in their path or otherwise hobble them to ensure that they become dragon food first.

Whoever ends up with the most reputation wins the bet and the game.

In more detail, each player starts with a few randomly-dealt knowledge cards, with these cards corresponding to some of the eight legendary locations: Atlantis, Himalayas, the pyramids of Egypt, and so on. On a turn, a character moves to a location of their choice, spending time to do based on what shows on the game board. At each location, the player can either collect additional knowledge (i.e. cards, with the player collecting cards based on the method showing at the specific location) or discard cards that match this location in order to place a diary token in their color on this space; the more cards they discard, the more points they might possibly earn.

Those points are only possible points because four times during the 75 weeks, the Club members meet again in London to compare their knowledge about the legends, and because time is at a premium, only the five most promising stories can be told. What stories will these be? Well, in game terms, one of the places that players can visit while traveling is Club headquarters in London, and here players can drop cards that they've collected. During the scoring phase, these cards are shuffled, then five different locations revealed  and these five locations are the only ones that score. Thus, the more often you share knowledge about a particular location, the more likely it is to score  but the less valuable it will be for you since you cannot use that knowledge for your diary!

The game includes 30 animal tiles, with six different types of animals, each valued 1-5. To set up the game, randomly create a 5x6 grid of animal tiles. Each player secretly chooses one of the six animal character tiles to see which animal they want to save.

On a turn, a player chooses any tile or stack of tiles and moves the tile/stack orthogonally onto an adjacent tile/stack. You can't move a tile to an empty space. When no more tiles/stacks can be moved, the game ends. Each player then reveals his animal character and takes all stacks that have that type of animal on top. The player scores one point for each tile he collects; in addition, if any of the type of animal are within a stack (not on top), the player scores points equal to the value of that buried animal tile.

The rules include a team variant in which players combine their scores at the end of the game, but don't know which animals their teammates are trying to save. Watch for tears and other clues of sadness when particular animals disappear from the board...

Using the Mayan Haab agricultural calendar invented in roughly 500 BC, players inform their villages when to best plant their seeds so that they may grow a tremendous harvest to feed their people. After their seeds are planted, the astronomers recommend rituals to aid in their harvest and their reading of prophecies in the stars, but problems arise. A village conducting a ritual to help their crop could be stealing the power of the sun or cosmos from a nearby neighbor. Droughts may crush other villages.

After crops have been harvested, the ancient astronomers now begin to forecast the prophecies of the stars. Using the technologies found in the Aztec Calendar, the important messages from the sky above may be telling us when and how the world will end. Players wager a bet about the ultimate destiny. With their knowledge of Prophecy they may influence this ultimate end, and also may know the exact date!

The game can be played as either a basic SUN game or an advanced DESTINY game.

Players in the basic game will score for the amount of villages they feed and Prophecy tokens they collect. The Destiny game is for players desiring a more involved game in which Prophecy tokens, earned conducting ritual, must be used to either influence the value of villages, investments in the future, and/or influencing how and when the world may come to an end.

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.

Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force. Well-armed with RPG's and mortars and backed by snipers, the defenders deployed small groups of hunter-killer teams to tackle any armor encountered. A battle for the city was set.

Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players can brutally harm their opponent, while each has liabilities to protect. Opponents will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.

Emergents: Genesis is a 2-4 player deckbuilding game that any age can enjoy, and a game lasts generally between 30-60 minutes. Everything you will need to play the game comes inside a box of Emergents: Genesis.

In Emergents: Genesis, players take on the role of powerful superheroesknown in this world as Emergentsand battle against the other players in the game to be the last person standing.

Players customize their decks based on four classes of superpowers in a fast-paced game that can be played by two to four players. Designed by Urban Island Games and Top8Magic, Emergents: Genesis introduces innovative, interactive mechanics to the deckbuilding game that will appeal to all fans of both the superhero genre and interactive card games.

Gameplay Description

Players are dealt two Emergents face down and choose one of the heroes to start the game with. The object of the game is reduce all of the other players' heroes to zero health by attacking them while also building your deck and customizing your Emergent's superpowers.

Each player begins with a deck containing nine Skill cards and three Attack cards. Cards that generate Skill are used to purchase additional cards while cards that generate Attack are used to defeat your opponents.

Each player shuffles their deck and draws six cards. They can purchase basic cards that advance their Emergent's class strategy or purchase more expensive cards that are available dealt face-up from the deck. Cards that are purchased get put in the player's discard pile and whenever a player can't draw a card they shuffle their deck. At the end of each turn, a player discards their hand and draws six cards from their deck.

As the game progresses, players will ideally create a deck that showcases their heroes' unique abilities and allows them to be the last player standing. While many deckbuilding games are points races, where someone crosses a finish line and wins, Emergents: Genesis requires you to defeat your opponents, which means you can defend yourself if you have purchased the right cards along the way.

Depicts the often designed fighting in/on and around little round top during the rebel assault during the late afternoon of the 2nd day of Gettysburg. Players receive points for destroying enemy brigades as well as several geographical features of the battlefield such as Little Round Top, Devils Den, the Peach Orchard, the infamous wheat field and the angle. Silhouette style counters depicting union and rebel troops in the traditional blue and gray colors add to the feel of the ebb and flow of the fighting. The map is quite small but is more than useful and never seems to get crowded.

One huge bonus... the game can be played solitaire, as rules have been added so a solo player can take control of the advancing confederates, whilst the game mechanics take care of the defending union brigades.

One wishes that more smaller scale and sized games had been produced over the years, I recommend this game to all ACW war gamers and anyone who likes solo war gaming.

There are two times three types of monsters in the game (fat vs thin, red vs blue vs yellow). Each player receives fifteen tiles. Each tile shows a monster on one side, and another monster on the other side (each possible duo of six monster types once). Each round, a card is drawn, that graphically shows which monsters have been invited to the party, such as: exactly two large red monsters, at least one small blue monster. In higher difficulty levels the tasks are fuzzier, such as more yellow monsters than red monsters or just as many blue as fat monsters.

After revealing a card with the task description, all players attempt to flip their tiles in real time, so that the invited monsters are shown. The first player that succeeds in doing so collects the most valuable diamond. Other players can still score, too, if they manage to complete the task within the alotted time, started by the first player who (thinks he) fulfilled the task.
After nine rounds, the player who collected best-scored diamonds is declared the winner.

The game comes with six difficulty levels, each level having 18 tasks on the cards.

Situation:

The war raged across Germany from 1618 to 1630 with the Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor retaining the upperhand. Then the tide of war changed when King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the Lion of the North, revitalized the cause of the Protestant princes of Germany. Bankrolled by France, the Swedes pushed their advantage towards the Emperor's most valuable ally, Maximilian of Bavaria. Though Catholic, France sought to keep the power of the Habsburgs in check by financially supporting the Swedish King.

From 1632 to 1648, Bavaria and the surrounding area became a crucial battlefront to knocking Bavaria out of the war. The Swedes enjoyed success until fate removed their King and their over-extended forces could not hold onto their gains. After the Swedes suffered a sharp defeat at Nrdlingen in 1634, France was forced to play a more active role or lose all she had paid for. A series of seesaw campaigns ensued as the French Arme d'Allemagne secured crossings of the Rhine and pushed the war back into the heart of Bavaria. The area became the proving ground of the greatest generals of the age - Turenne, Cond, Mercy, de Werth. Neither side possessed a clear superiority of forces so it was a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, march, counter-march, siege, and surprise attacks. After several years, a combined French-Swedish campaign finally broke the back of the Bavarians in 1646 and Maximilian made a separate peace. It did not last long; after a year he reluctantly rejoined the Imperial cause. Repeating the winning combination of 1646, the French-Swedish army ended Maximilian's enterprise at Zusmarshausen in 1648.


The Game:

Won by the Sword is the first game in Ben Hull's Great Campaigns of the Thirty Years War series. It is a two-player game of operational warfare in the 17th Century. Armies maneuver on a point to point map of Southern Germany based on the road network available at the time. Each game is centered around a major battle or full campaign season. A Turn is a month divided into a variable number of impulses. Each army has a hand of Campaign Cards that control the amount of activity it may perform, the supplies it must expend, and a special action. Each impulse features one card play per army. Forces are concealed off map so players are faced with limited knowledge of the enemy. The major activities are maneuver, foraging, besieging fortifications, and an occasional battle. Won by the Sword is a low-complexity game with emphasis on the players maneuvering their forces, but many decisions await. The low rules complexity allows each player, rather than being encumbered with rules, to focus on choices regarding how to manage his campaign.

Object

The object is to win the game by ridding yourself of all cards in your hand before your opponent[s].

Game Summary

Decide on a scorekeeper. Once the cards have been shuffled, the scorekeeper deals 3 cards face down to each player, along with an equal number of white dice, called a stash. The scorekeeper places the remaining cards face down off to one side of the table to form a deck.

The scorekeeper begins the game by rolling two dice (1 black  1 white) in the center of the table. If no one scores, play rotates clockwise to the next player who rolls two dice. Any two die, including the black die can be rolled (see below). Before each roll players examine their cards to see what dice combinations will be needed to match a card in their hand.

Two white dice from your stash, or. 
One die from your stash, and one (previously rolled) die from the table, or
Two (previously rolled) dice from the table.

Players take turns rolling until someone shouts STRUT! indicating a player believes they have won the round. A round is won when you match a card in your hand with a dice combination on the table. Lets say you have a 4 of a Kind (card) in your hand. There are 8 dice on the table 1,3,4,6 and four 5s: 5, 5, 5. You quickly shout Strut! believing your dice combination (four 5s) matches the card (4 of a Kind) in your hand, thus winning the round. But have you? You have if one of your 5s is the black die. The black die must always be part of the score.

Keeping score is very simple. All dice on the table are scored. The black die counts face value [1]=1 point, [2]= 2 points [3]=3 points, etc. White dice count 1 point each. In the example above, you scored a total of 12 points (5 points for the black die and 7 points for the white dice.)

After each round the winners points are totaled by the scorekeeper. After the scorekeeper has recorded the points, the winner discards his/her winning card, placing it face up under the deck. If the winners accumulated score totals less than 30 points then he/she must draw one new card from the deck. If the winner has accumulated 30 or more points, no card is drawn allowing that player to begin ridding his/her hand of cards in an attempt to win the game. (Re-Action cards are an exception to the 30 points rule.) All other players keep their cards. Dice on the table are evenly redistributed. Note: As you will see as the game progresses, tactics and strategies become a big part of each round.

The winner begins the next round by rolling 1 black and 1 white die. Play continues until someone shouts Strut! The first player to accumulate 30 or more points with no cards remaining in their hand wins the game.

The Black Rooster

If an opponent throws the Black Rooster card down on your winning card, it spells disaster! You must turn in all the cards in your hand, and draw 3 replacements. Plus, you lose all your accumulated points.

The Conquest of Gaul, 58-52 BC

March with Julius Caesar and his legions in the conquest of Gaul, 58-52 BC. This is a two player game. One commands the Romans, the other the Gauls as well as allied Brittanic and Germanic tribes. The game pieces include: legions, auxiliaries, fleets and tribal war bands. The map stretches from the Roman frontier across the three parts of Gaul to the Rhine, as well as across the Northern Sea into Britannia.

In Caesars War each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate recruits for the armies, movement abilities, special combat bonuses and historic events. Some of the Roman cards include: Legions on the March, Unrest in the Ranks, and British Campaign. Some of the Gallic cards include: Helvetian Migration, German Invasion, and Uprising of Gallic Tribes.

Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical procedure. Each side has unique advantages, with Roman discipline pitted against Gallic ferocity. There are special rules for camps, sieges, morale, and great leaders such as Vercingetorix and Caesar himself. Having the right commander at the right battle can mean the difference between laurels and disaster.

In Concord, smaller things grow. In Discord, greater things decay.

Vera Discordia is a fantasy warfare printplay cardgame for 2 players licensed with a Creative Commons (Attribution-NonCommercial-NonDerivative). It will be first published in Spanish, followed by an English translation. Behind this project there's a team of 7 illustrators, 2 graphic artists, a dozen of playtesters and a designer/coordinator, all working for personal satisfaction.

Vera Discordia is not collectible, but modular. Each module will bring more armies to play with, for a total of 8 different armies. Epic and multiplayer variants will also be published.

Vera Discordia plays on an imaginary board, and its army decks are fixed: there is no deck building, so you'll have to prove your skills in the battlefield. Assign orders to your troops, use Terrain in your favor, Maneuver, Support, close your lines and try to break through enemy lines. Launch direct attacks, arrow salvoes or unexpected flying attacks in order to decimate the opposing forces or capture the enemy General.

Vera Discordia takes place in an unique fantasy setting. Take command of the spiritual Nir and their faerical allies, the Gardarek demon-worshipping barbarians, the strict Akeyrith and their celestial cohorts, the unfathomable Shogh made of pure Darkness, the reckless Zleradainn and their bloody rituals, the wild Falkaethe and their birds of prey companions, the ancient empire of Iskelond and their refined tecnoalchemy, or the exotic Drakaethe dragonriders and their skilled assassins.

Welcome to the Age of Discord.

On a turn, the active player draws a card. If it's a hive card, she takes a hive from the middle without lifting it up; if it's a bear card, she returns one hive to the middle of the table; if it's a bee card, she lifts one hive to reveal the bee. If the bee matches the color on the card, she moves the hive towards herself.

The first player with four hives wins! Alternatively, when the cards run out, whoever has the most hives in front of her wins.

Each turn, players have to deal with and negotiate random events in the area, then continue the turn under those circumstances, by drawing Tinker cards to fill their hand up to five cards, then rolling dice to determine their resources for that turn. Players then spend those resources to build new Gadgets or augment their existing Gadgets with Modifications. These Gadgets and Modifications can then be Delivered to the townsfolk for Reputation. In addition players can choose to scrap cards from their hand, and pull them out of circulation.

To assist them in their endeavor to build the best contraptions in the land, players utilize three Assistants that are granted one at a time as play progresses; activate the Assistants provides bonuses to the player from various locations around town.

Players also have the opportunity to show their worthiness by picking up new Feat cards during their turn. Completing these Feats provide a nice boost in Reputation during, or even at the end of the game.

Since it's hard to keep all your thoughts in one place as a tinker, players end the turn by passing their hands around the table to a neighbor.

The player that has earned the most Reputation from Delivering Gadgets and accomplishing Feats wins!

177513,Strife: Shadows and Steam,2016,7.00705,44,2,2,2,30,60,,Card Game Science Fiction ,Hand ManagementPattern BuildingSimultaneous Action Selection,"The original Champions of Aerim have long since faded from memory. Technology has begun its slow and steady rise within civilization, while many still cling desperately to the magic of old. Astaria itself has grown into a vast, sprawling empire, yet rebellion is carried on whispers from deep within the shadows. The strength of steam could spark a revolution. But for the Eternals, the cycle continues as it always has. For them, there is only... strife.

Strife: Shadows and Steam is a stand-alone sequel to Strife: Legacy of the Eternals. Using the same core mechanics, Strife: SaS introduces new characters, abilities and a unique twist or two that will be sure to add a fresh take on this exciting game. This sequel is also fully compatible with the original game, so you can face off with champions of Aerim from different ages!

Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.

Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.

Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!

171419,My First Bohnanza,2015,6.75435,46,1.2857,3,5,30,30,,Card Game Children's Game Farming ,Hand ManagementTrading,"My First Bohnanza serves as both an introduction to Bohnanza and as a children's game in its own right, with the goal of the game being the same as its parent: Have the most Talers at the end of play.

As in the original Bohnanza, the game includes multiple types of beans, with each bean having a number on it to indicate how many copies are in the game as well as a beanometer at the bottom of the card to show you how many cards of this type you need to harvest in order to collect Talers. My First Bohnanza has simplified beanometers, with four types of beans having only a single exchange value  e.g., five Gemeine (common) beans get you one Taler  and six types of beans having two exchange values. Games with the youngest players (or newcomers to the Bohnanza universe) should use the single beanometer cards with the other cards forming a Taler stack.

To play, each player gets five cards, which they lay in a face-up row, and a beanfield tile that shows spots for two types of beans. On a turn, a player must plant the first (leftmost) card in one of her fields and she can choose to plant a second. Players try to group cards of the same type in the same field, but they can cover beans of different types, if needed. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and either keeps them or trades them (and cards from her hand, if desired) for cards held by other players; all traded cards must be planted. To end her turn, the player draws three cards and adds them to her row.

As soon as a player has the proper number of bean cards in order in one of her fields, she harvests them, placing these cards in the discard pile and collecting a Taler from the stack. If those cards covered beans of another type, she can then start building on those beans again. After going through the deck 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and whoever has the most Talers wins.

Once players have played My First Bohnanza a few times, you can swap the single beanometer cards for the double beanometer cards, which now gives players a choice of when to harvest. Subsequently, you can combine the two decks, which introduces the rule about using one of the bean cards to serve as the Taler (which adjusts the quantity of that type of bean in the deck). With additional plays, you can add in the remaining rules of Bohnanza, such as needing to harvest for no Talers when planting, paying for a third beanfield, keeping your cards in hand, and not being able to harvest a field with only one card.

The higher a player's sheep gets before meeting its shepherds, the more points he will score. The player who scores the most points wins.

Each player has shepherds to place on the board and sheep to place into flocks and move. Flocks often contain sheep from many players and cooperation can be key to moving a flock into an advantageous position. But how long will this helpful, peaceful pastoral scene last when the cards require players to take actions for other players which can include placing opponents' shepherds in lower scoring areas and moving flocks that do not contain their own sheep?And a hungry wolf ever lurks in the background...

A deck of cards is used by the players to take actions such as placing shepherds, putting sheep into flocks, moving flocks of sheep, and moving the wolf. It is these cards, with their requirement to manipulate other players' pieces, that drive the decisions the players must make in the game and guarantee a high level of interaction among players. Each player also has a Sheepdog wild card for use once per game.

The Confederates were at the height of their military capabilities and were looking for a quick way to end the war by aiming at Washington. The battles of Brandy Station, Second Winchester, and Gettysburg were fought during this campaign.

The game system uses a double blind system. One player takes the role of Gen. Robert E. Lee, the other acts as Maj.Gen. Joseph Hooker (until June 28th) and then Maj.Gen. Geore G. Meade. Movement determined by command points which is determined by quality of leaders. Rules include the variables of replacing Hooker with Meade. There are two identical maps with each player having one and hidden from each other. Players will need to search out the other's army by using cavalry and pickets. Victory is determined by destroying enemy units and capturing or defending real estate. Two additional scenarios: The Great Invasion (starting on turn 14), and Lee vs. Meade. Optional rules cover Rain, Bridge Burning, Naval Movement, Piccett Goes West, and Reynolds Takes Command.

There are unique sets of rules for two, three, and four players. The winner is the player who manages to match the colors on the back of their double sided cards with their goal pattern. You must maintain the perspective of the cards so that you never see the back side of your own cards.

Perspective can be played with 2 to 4 players or as a solitaire game. 2-4 player games are played with a hand of 3 cards. Each card is double-sided, so when held one side is facing toward the player and the other is facing their opponents. The front side of the cards will determine what actions a player may take. When a card is played, it is placed into the Used Pile with the front side of the card face up.

Each player has a goal card placed in front of them on the table, their objective is to get the Back Side of their hand to match the colors and order of their goal hand. At any point during a players turn, they may lay down their 3 cards without tampering to see if their goal is met. If the players cards do not match the goal card, they are eliminated from the game.

Tattered Flags is a series of Kriegspiel-style historical miniatures/board game depicting battles of the American Civil War (1861-1865). In this first game in the series, each player controls a Union or Confederate force at the Battle of Gettysburg, struggling for The Wheatfield on July 2nd, 1863. Gettysburg: The Wheatfield was carefully crafted to introduce players to system basics of organization, events, maneuver, fire and morale, with future games in this series promising to expand the detail and accuracy of the Tattered Flags system.

Since many players do not have the time, funds or eyesight to paint armies of miniature figures, Tattered Flags comes with colorful cardboard counters, called Stands (in the vernacular of miniatures gaming). These games also use a printed battlefield game map in lieu of miniature trees, hills, buildings, etc. Feel free to substitute miniature figures if desired!

There are three scenarios included in Gettysburg: The Wheatfield, each with its own Order of Battle (OOB), Special Rules, Turn Length and Victory Condition. The first scenario is introductory in complexity and is used when someone is first learning and playing the game. The second scenario is the historical scenario depicting the actual fighting that occurred during the afternoon of July 2nd. The final scenario is a dramatic, what-if meeting engagement battle.

Game Data:
Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale
Solitaire Suitability: 7 on a 9 scale
Scale: 1 inch = 50 yards; each Stand is approximately 150 men or 3-4 cannon; each turn represents a variable amount of time, perhaps 15 to 20 minutes or so

In addition, the Battles of Cape Engao, Surigao Strait, and Okinawa are covered by the game.  The American fleet is enormous in this product, while the whittled-down Japanese fleet is not much larger than the SOPAC and Midway games.  To balance that side in hypothetical scenarios, some projected but never completed, or sometimes built, units are available as options to the Japanese  such as the third Yamato-class battleship, all six Unryu-class carriers, the B64-type Battlecruiser (one of the two named by AP Sagami), as well as squadrons of hypothetical second generation Japanese aircraft.  Its a worst case scenario plan for American military staff.

The Americans get some new toys, too, including the first appearance in the series of the F4U Corsair, the Iowa-class battleships (and a special guest appearance by the Montana-class), Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, Cleveland-class light cruisers, Independence-class escort carriers, Essex-class fleet carriers, and the fabulous Alaska-class battlecruisers...errr...large cruisers, that is.

I left Congress on the 11th of November, 1777, that year which the Tories said, had three gallows in it, meaning the three sevens.
~John Adams

1777: The Year of the Hangman is an operational study of the campaign for Philadelphia. Between September 1st and December 19th two armies contended for the American capital, seat of the rebellion, home to the Congress, and from where independence from Great Britain had been declared only the year before. In this contest battles were fought in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Today roadside placards mark these places: Cooch's Bridge, the banks of the Brandywine, The Battle of the Clouds, and Germantown. For 225 years a solemn, common grave has marked the site of the Paoli Massacre. Glory attends the name of Red Bank where the hated Hessian was sent packing, and the fight for Fort Mercer where the Royal Navy suffered its worst defeat of the entire war. Fort Mifflin stands in mute testament to the patriot's naked valor; while Valley Forge remains a shrine to his devotion.

Yet all this could have ended on the gallows for Washington and his men, instead of the nation we call the United States of America.

Scale: Two miles per hex. Units: Primarily Brigades and Divisions with a strength point representing roughly 200 men (or 1 regiment). Turns: One day divided into several movement pulses.

Contents: 1 Map (34 x 22), 1 Counter sheet (280 pieces). 2 Off Board Army Displays, Box, 1 six sided die, Rulebook, including extensive Historical Commentary and a dozen scenarios ranging in length from the entire campaign to simple battle vignettes that last half an hour.

Take control of the great battles of the 18th and 19th centuries with Volley  Bayonet. Created by the people who brought you Command Decision, Volley  Bayonet gives you the ability to recreate the full scope of the epic battles of the black powder era.

Each turn represents one hour on the battlefield but can be played in only fifteen to thirty minutes.

Suitable for 5mm all the way up to 30mm. Alternatively you can simply tack down your existing stands onto VB sized bases, and you're ready to go.

Volley  Bayonet covers the entire period from the adoption of the socket bayonet (about 1700) up to the widespread issue of machineguns and magazine rifles (about 1890). The rules, with a few modifications to provide period flavor and to cover newer weapons, allow players to fight out battles throughout that entire dynamic era. All the battles and campaigns of Marlborough, Frederick, Napoleon, Lee and Grant, and Bismarck are at your disposal, and the rules include complete scenarios for almost a dozen battles.

Three scenario books published:
Battles of the American Civil War (GDW)--10 scenarios and a Campaign System using 'A House Divided' boardgame.

The game includes 6 historical scenarios that are based around the Normandy Theater in 1944.

Players will plan their strategies, and activate units to reach the scenario objective in the required number of turns.

The rules allow two different levels of play, Basic and Advanced. The advanced game requires an initial planning that only a good knowledge of the basic game will allow.

The unit scale for the game is Battalion level for infantry, and Company level for other units. One hexagon on the map represents a distance of 300 to 500 meters depending on the scenario. Each game turn represents about 20 to 30 minutes.

An innovative system of activation determines the movement sequence for the various units, with the possibility for the Command Units to perform various additional actions such as calling in artillery support and Rally units.

All units have the possibility of performing opportunity fire when an enemy unit moves within 2 hexagons of its ZOC.

The game uses special 6-sided dice for combat with icons instead of numbers to determine outcome according to of the type of target (personnel or armored].

A deck of event cards for both the players, that also provide unit reinforcements, will make each game unique with endless replay ability.

Player aid charts for each nationality represent all the essential elements for intuitive play and immediate accessibility. War to Axis will satisfy the beginner and experienced player alike,
immersing you in a historically accurate period where you determine the final outcome.

During the game, 1 inch square pieces move across a rectangular board divided into squares arranged in rows and columns. Each player has a number of units in his army, which is set depending on the faction they are playing. We call this combination of units a Combat Sword. Four factions are available for players:  Union of Terra, Centauri Brotherhood, Heimdall Industries and Ascaryan Infestation.

Game pieces represent the units of troops and vehicles in each army. Pieces have two sides, Front (Illustration and Health marker) and Back (Name, Attributes and Skills). Some units grant X Command Points at the beginning of each player turn, and all units require a number of Command Points to be used that turn (which is known as Activating  the unit). When all command points are spent, the opponents turn begins. Each unit, upon being activated, can move and act in any order. The possible actions are Move, Embark/disembark, Attack and Use active skills.

A typical game is a Sudden Death match, where the winner is the player that eliminates their opponents ability to activate units. However, in addition to this a description of advanced rules and missions for more experienced players is given.

The fears deep down ones mind is amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing the body and the sanity. Only the ones with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp. Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecrafts work and the Alien series. In the game, players will assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event. Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.

The game is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals. From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combats. With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness. Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed. Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase.

In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness. As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.

In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms. Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly.

Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately. Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act.

In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved.

In each investigators turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely. Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness, but decisions are not obvious unfortunately. Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions, and each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate. Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.

Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn. In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different. However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy.

In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc. However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens. As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text.

Players get a number of cards with historical events (most often very obscure ones) and have to arrange them chronologically on the table by playing one card per turn.

If a player thinks there is an error in the sequence of events, he or she can express this doubt instead of playing a card of his own. Depending on the outcome of the subsequent check, either the doubter or the player who put down the previous card is punished with additional hand cards.
The goal of the game is to get rid of your hand cards as soon as possible.

There are quite a few games in the Anno Domini series, each dealing with a different topic ranging from Inventions over Art or Coins to different geographic regions (e.g. Germany, America or now Europe). Even a SdJ edition exists!

Each game consists of 336 cards and can be played stand-alone or mixed together with some or all of the other editions.

You can have some of the cards come back later. These you secretly insert anywhere into the dream deck. Will you play to win or to make your opponent lose?

186751,Mythic Battles: Pantheon,2016,9.54847,98,3.1429,2,4,45,90,,Ancient Card Game Dice Miniatures Mythology Wargame ,Area MovementCampaign / Battle Card DrivenCard DraftingDice RollingHand ManagementPlayer Elimination,"Hera, tired of Zeus' infidelity, decides to take her revenge and releases the Titans on Mount Olympus. In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.

As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.

The world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however...

Hades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.

As a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.

In Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game. Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back.

The game takes place in a low-fantasy world much like Europe during the Dark Ages in which three major kingdoms are at war. These kingdoms are based loosely on real ones from that time period  but the war is the least of their concerns as a perilous and relentless plague is speading across the world. Now the kingdoms are being wiped out from all sides.

The players must protect their lands in battle to try to keep the plague at bay. You supply the bodies  let PLAGUE supply the fun!

The new additions include a new character as well as a point system to replace the all-or-nothing nature of accusations.  The basic idea is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of seven different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers. Abilities are used to acquire three different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities. If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.

The first is the Production Round, which includes a basic production phase, a secondary production phase, and a mobilization phase. Second is the Trade Round. Third is the Consumption Round, during which a player expends food points, expends consumer points, calculates and declares social status, and provides military supply for any combat units under his control. Fourth is the Military/Political Round, which begins with the political placement phase, followed by initial military movement, secondary military movement, combat, and elections. The fifth and last round of the game turn is the Finance Round, which includes the political disassociation phase, the stockpile/labour reallocation phase, industrial investment phase, taxation, the industrial capacity adjustment phase, the industrial labour reallocation phase, and finally, the  depreciation and shrinkage phase.

In addition, immediately before the fourth and eighth game turns, the Population Growth Cycle occurs during which the labour population of each region increases by 10%.

These rogue data jockeys pit themselves against the most secure systems in the world for the thrill of it (and maybe to make a little money on the side). However, the most skilled hackers know it's not about getting there first; it's about ghosting in and out of the system without leaving a trace.

Black Hat features a random and evolving game board that players progress through during the game, and while that progress helps you toward victory, the first player to finish doesn't necessarily win.

Black Hat allows wide variety of game play strategies to be applied, none of them clearly superior over another, as you have to adapt to situation.

At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously drop a predetermined number of tiles onto the board, then quickly flip them all ivory side up. (The fronts of the tiles are ivory, while the backs are orange.) At this point the round is a free-for-all, with players racing to call out one word each. If the last player is taking too long to call a word, any of his opponents can hurry him by starting the timer; if he doesn't call out a word in 15 seconds, he busts, scoring nothing.

Once every player has called a word for the round, they score points in the order they called out the words, so the first player who called scores first, the second player second, etc. The first time a tile is used  that is, while its ivory side is face-up  the tile is worth 10 points. Once it's been scored, flip (or KerFlip) it to its orange side, reducing its value to 5 points for all other players who used it in the same round. Some tiles, identified by a small number in the bottom right corner, are premium tiles that award players cards with bonus point values.

At the end of each round, return any unused (ivory) tiles to the draw pouch and sweep all used (orange) tiles into the collection chutes in the game box. The game lasts 15-20 minutes (about 10-12 rounds) depending on the number of players (2-4). To clean up at the end of the game, pick up the game box and gently shake it to funnel the tiles into a collection cup under the board.

3219,Demonworld,1999,6.55351,57,4.2,2,6,120,120,,Adventure Fantasy Medieval Miniatures ,Hex-and-Counter,"Demonworld is a hybrid miniatures and hex style wargame. The basic game comes with a 140 page rulebook, reference sheets, unit recruitment cards, 4 hex maps, and card stock counters representing a small orc and human (Empire) army.  The maps are generic terrain maps with light woods and small hills.  They may be combined in different ways to create different battlefields.  If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.

Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.

As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   
The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.

Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.

Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.

Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.

The Assyrians were the innovators of siege warfare. All siege techniques like rams, towers, undermining city walls have been developed to mastery by the Assyrians. Typical Assyrian is the shield bearer with oversize shields protecting the masses of bowmen from enemy fire.

Set in ancient Mesopotamia, Assyrian Wars (722 to 605 BC) covers the ruler period of the last four great Assyrian Kings and the decline and fall period resulting in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the defeat of their Egyptian Allies.

In 722 BC, Sargon II becomes King in Nineveh as new King of the World. A couple of problems threaten the strongest and most effective Army the world has seen so far.

In the West an Assyrian Army is inflicting a hunger siege on Samaria in Israel. Will the Egyptian Pharaoh interfere?

In the North the rampaging Uratu Kingdom is threatening the Assyrian borders.

In the South Mardukkapallidin has become King of Babylonia. He started a revolt against Assyria, the mighty Elam in the Southeast joined him.

In the East the innumerable Mede tribes become a growing threat. The first signs of a large migration from the North consisting of Cimmerian and Scythian tribes become visible. And all those minor state tribute refusers who need to be punished!

Will you as the Assyrian King maintain your Empire? Or will you as Babylonia, Mede, Elam, or Egypt free the world from Assyrian Tyranny?

Assyrian Wars is a multi player game, but with the Assyrian player against all others. Temporary Alliance changes possible. Conflicting trade interests may cause minor conflicts.  It can, however, be played solitaire as well.

Each game turn represents the ruler period of one Assyrian King, the last turn decline and fall. Turns are divided into impulses. Follow the order of states on the impulse track each card played represents an impulse.

Assyrian Wars is a point to point game.  Assyrian Wars gives an easy entry for beginners.  Still the game provides complex games situations depending on players strategy. Every game is different for nobody knows which random cards a player gets in addition to his fixed home cards.

For the experienced players there are challenging specials like Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, Bowmen, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Horsebowmen, and Chariots.

Assyrian Wars allows detailed siege warfare. 66 cities on the map are waiting for you to take them. Can you overcome the massive city walls and water your horses at the Rivers of Babylon? The decision is yours to make.

All players have a goal to reach a different city at a certain time in order to maximize points.  As each player has a different set of goals, some players will benefit while others will lose out.

On each turn, the control of the car will be auctioned. After the auction round, the winner pays the bank and chooses the destination for the car.

Upon arrival at a city, the driver receives that city's suitcase. This suitcase can indicate that the driver receives up to five points or $1,500.  It may also say that he loses up to three points or $1,000.

Additionally, upon arriving in a city, players may play action cards that correspond to the city. Points are awarded depending on the day of the week of the arrival.  Tuesdays and Fridays you receive double points.

The game ends either when a player has received 69 points or when a player is out of action cards.  Each player can then buy additional points for $1,000 each.

The game is played on a diagonal grid, with the players playing pieces on the intersections. The basic game is played as follows:

At the start of the game, the first player places the neutral Moeraki-ball on one of the nine central intersections of the board. After that, the players take turns placing one of their own pieces on the board. When a square is on the board is completely enclosed by pieces, the player who has the majority (normally 3:1, but it can be 2:1 or 3:0 next to the edge or the neutral Moeraki-ball) claims the field and places a tribe marker on it.

The game can be won in one of four ways:
1. Tahuna (beach): A player wins if he has enclosed a field with four of his own pieces.
2. Awa (river): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the intersections on one of the diagonal lines from one edge to another edge.
3. Ara (road): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the four intersections on one edge.
4. Marae (holy ground): When all the fields in the center have been claimed, players count the number of tribal markers they have got on the board (markers that are on the edge and that have been claimed with a 2:1 majority count only half). The player with the most markers wins the game.

The players win several matches, until one of them has won the pre-determined amount of matches.

In the advanced version of the game, both players receive a Maori-Tane (warrior). Once during the game, a player may place the Tane on the board instead of a tribal marker. When he does so, all he chooses a direction. Any fields between the Tane and the edge in that direction cannot be claimed; any markers already present are removed.

142903,Foragers,2016,6.71696,56,2.0909,2,4,60,80,,Ancient Economic Exploration Prehistoric ,Modular BoardPick-up and DeliverTile Placement,"Foragers is a strategy game in which players take on the role of ancient foragers competing to be the most respected member of the tribe. In the game, foragers pick fruit from trees, fish in lakes, and hunt aurochs in the fields. After collecting these foods, the foragers return to a fire pit, where they share their food with the tribe and earn victory points. In addition, the foragers sometimes happen upon tools, which allow them to forage, fish, or hunt more efficiently.  Of course, foragers are not completely altruistic and so they occasionally fight with each other to earn respect. The player who can best optimize their food and tool gathering, while also avoiding or winning skirmishes is the one who eventually earns the tribe leader title.

The game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, depending upon the number of players. In each round, all players simultaneously choose an action card, from a hand of 3 action cards (drawn from a deck of 10) to use for that round. Each action card lists 5 different actions, but a player may only use 4 of those actions each round. Then, in clockwise order, each player performs 1 of the actions on their card until all players have performed 4 actions. Such actions include things like: walking, foraging, eating, discovering, resting, sharing, and picking up a tool.

When players pick up food, they place it on their tableau, which tracks the food's freshness. At the end of each round, a spoilage card is flipped and all players age their food (i.e., move them along a food track).  As the food gets older, it does not provide as much energy if eaten.  Also, to score victory points, players must share their food before it spoils.  In this sense, the players are racing not only against each other, but against nature.

Players descend into a dungeon randomly laid-out from a stack of tiles, fighting through the orc and goblin hordes to rescue the kidnapped maiden and collect treasure and glory.

Each player takes turns to move through the dungeon one tile at a time, laying new tiles as unexplored areas are entered; every time a player enters a room, special monster dice are rolled to determine the enemies faced and the potential loot to be found. When a monster attacks, a die is rolled to determine the style of their attack; the player then chooses a card from his hand to counter with, each card being strong against some kinds of attack and weak against others.

The ultimate goal of the game is for the players to fight their way to the bottom of the dungeon to rescue the captured maiden - and then fight their way out with her. The dungeon will become harder to fight through as the player delves deeper, and then harder still on the way out with a helpless rescuee in tow.

This Print-and-Play game was an entry in the 'One Full-sheet Label' design contest here on BGG, and as such the printed components fit entirely on a single label sheet. A small number of other tokens and blank dice will also be required. Additionally, as the name hints, once constructed on cardstock it is possible to fit the game inside an Altoids tin or similar.

Game start was different, decided by random allocation of city starting locations. Radiation markers could be cleared away as an entire turn action of non-fighting and non-moving armies. H-Bombs were removed from the game completely.

Eventually the GW licence would expire, and ownership and rights would revert to Mike Hayes, who then went on to re-publish his 2012 Classic Warlord version with the full map and H-Bombs restored and rules re-organised for the more classic gameplay from the earlier Red Box and Blue Box versions.

Everyone wants to gain control of the valuable asteroid field, and there is only one way to do this: Destroy all opposing ships!

Speed, shields and firepower have to be optimized to conserve energy, and the maneuvers of the enemies have to be anticipated in order to be able to strike at just the right moment. And just to make things interesting, the fight takes place right among the asteroids.

Interstellar Mayhem can be learned quickly and provides exciting space duels in a deadly asteroid field. Every player controls one spaceship and uses tactic and a bit of luck to destroy as many opposing spaceships as possible.

The rules can be explained in a few minutes, but mastering the tactical possibilities of the game remains a challenge even after many battles.

- A lot of gaming material (6 spaceship models, 18 real stones for the asteroids, 40 colored dice, 18 technology cards, 6 spaceship sheets, a large game plan and game-counters)
- Easy to learn rules
- Tactical depth
- Variable game setup
- Rules and gaming material in German and English
- 2-6 players, playing time about 30 minutes, Ages 12 and up

In this fast-paced space-tactic-shooter, every player chooses one of the 6 spaceship models and fights against the other players. If your spaceship is destroyed, you take a new one and jump right back into the action - the first player to score 3 kills is the winner.

The beautiful gaming material and the variable game setup provide a big replay value.

Following a furious fighting where the French army, under the eyes of the King Louis XV, struggles but does not fall, the Pragmatic army retreats, leaving behind thousands of fallen men.

Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning.  For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand.  Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.

By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game.  The airship pirate who has claimed the most gold at the end of the game receives the title of Pirate Admiral and declares victory over the competition.

20000,Anno Domini: Gesundheit und Ernährung,2005,7.02632,38,2,2,8,30,30,,Bluffing Card Game Educational Humor Party Game Trivia ,Card Drafting,"Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.
If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.

Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this aint no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because its full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.

Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.

The Set Anno Domini - Gesundheit und Ernhrung  contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.

The setting is the Unions Peninsula Campaign in the spring of 1862.  McClellan has formed and trained a large army, transported it by sea in an outflanking maneuver, marched it to the gates of the Confederate capital, and is poised to capture the city and probably bring an end to the rebellion.  On the Confederate side Lee has taken over the Army after Johnston was wounded.  Unlike Johnston, who was content to fight a largely defensive campaign, Lee gathered every unit he could get his hands on and launched his own offensive.  The Union had placed its army in an awkward position, with one corps north of Chickahominy River and the rest south of it.  Lees plan, and the position of the units when the game starts, was to crush the Union Corps and then drive the rest of McClellans army from the capital, destroying as much of it as he possible could.  With that accomplished he would have a free hand to turn north.

The system is a simplified version of two games, the last area-impulse Avalon Hill published, Breakout: Normandy, and MMP's Monty's Gamble: Market Garden.

The game features leaders who are rated for initiative and combat effectiveness. Another mechanism in the game is the advantage marker which can be traded to the opponent to do things like rally, conduct a combined assault, declare a heroic defense that turns a success into a stalemate, or receive additional replacements.

The victory conditions are based on territorial control.  For the Union that was Richmond.  For the Confederacy that was the Union supply heads  White House Landing and Harrisons Landing  and Malvern Hill.  A key decision for the Union player is when to shift his supply train from White House Landing to the more secure location at Harrisons Landing.

The unit scale is divisional including artillery and cavalry.

There is the campaign game, and a few optional rules.  Playing time should be under three hours between experienced players.

The campaign under examination is Operation Bagration, the Red Armys summer offensive of 1944 during which they destroyed more German manpower and equipment than had been lost at Stalingrad.

Without question a one-sided affair in terms of which side is shaping the battlefield and controlling the tempo, weve managed to make things more interesting for both players by broadening the map to cover not only Byelorussia, but all of the Baltic Republics as well as the northwest Ukraine. That expansion gives both players more interesting options and strategies in terms of how to pursue victory.
 Each hex on the 34x22 large-hex map equals 16 miles (26 kilometers). Each of the nine game turns equals one week, from IV June through IV August. Units of maneuver are corps (and static fortified localities) for the Germans and armies for the Soviets. The latters great airpower advantage is represented in the form of 10 air armies. There are 176 large-size unit-counters included, most done in NATO-style, but also with iconic markers. The system is an adaptation of the one used in issue number threes Bulge, which means two experienced players can finish a match in about three to four hours.

The historical scenario provides exact set ups for both sides, but there are also free-deployment options. The Bold Stroke scenario allows the Soviet player to try the approach the Germans were expecting: putting the weight of the offensive in the western Pripyat Marsh and driving straight for Koenigsberg. Other options allow the investigation of such historical what ifs as the failure of the Western Allies D-Day landing or no July bomb plot against Hitler.

88006,Patton's First Victory: Tunisia,2010,7.24697,33,2,1,2,120,120,,Wargame World War II ,Dice RollingHex-and-Counter,"Pattons First Victory is an all-new echelon of wargame, providing a simple, yet accurate, simulation of World War IIs Tunisian campaign and featuring a mere four pages of rules that elegantly recreate the battles fought between Allied and Axis forces.
In addition to its simplicity, Pattons First Victory is marvelously accurate, featuring the full order of battle of historic divisions that were engaged during the struggle for Tunisia, as well as allotments of support assets that can be assigned to those divisions to increase their combat strength. Should the Axis player assign his few support assets to his best divisions to form powerful strike groups, or should he use them to augment his light units desperately defending the ridges?
Pattons First Victory portrays all the elements of the actual campaign. The terrain is historically accurate; every town and airbase is precisely correct, and every unit is rated with precise combat factors. You will see why the 10th Panzer Division was so formidable, and how Patton was able to defeat the vestige of the famed Afrikakorps.
The entire Tunisian campaign can be played in a couple hours, yet Pattons First Victory remains a game requiring operational skill. The Allied player must maintain the momentum and keep pressure on the Axis, fighting for a breakthrough to capture enough of the important Tunisian harbors to win the game. The Axis player must manage his scant yet potent army and air force to repel the attacking Allies, all the while watching for opportunities to counterattack and throw the throw them back in disarray.
Pattons First Victory is a quick and easy game of the 1943 campaign between Allied and Axis forces in North Africa during World War II. Its spring 1943; the Allies have arrived to liberate Tunisia from the Axis, but the Axis soldiers are experienced and commanded by some of the best generals of the war. If Axis forces can hold on in the Tunisian mountains, they can delay the progress of the war in the west indefinitely. If the Allies can capture the Tunisian harbors, they will cut off the Axis from all supply and escape.

A set of six types of basic cards providing resource production and victory points is combined with a set of seven types of randomly chosen action cards to form a supply. Each card represents a type of building that the players may add to their cities.

The active player rolls three dice, chooses one number to keep, then passes the remaining dice clockwise for other players to select. The active player may then negotiate with opponents to trade dice, in order to build up certain combinations of numbers, which represent different kinds of resources. These combinations are then spent to purchase cards to be added to the player's tableau.

The game ends either when one player reaches a total of 20 points or when the last Mercantile House card in the supply is purchased. The player with the most points wins.

Mea Culpa is a paradise-and-pandemonium gamer's game thats all about sins and sinners. Be it at the brothel or at the market, men such as the Pope or the Emperor can be seen hard at work at any time of the day. Even the most miserable miser, though, would be well advised to also strive to get hold of enough precious stones and wine to make sufficient donations towards the Lord's cathedrals. After all, it is through pious generosity that a poor soul can gain the all-important letters of indulgence and be pardoned for a life of greed and lust. When all is said done, what matters is to have sinned just enough to have achieved all goals and gotten away with it, while others took the fall.

In more detail, to win, players have to end the game with their poor souls closer to heaven's gate than their opponents. Alas, throughout the game these poor souls pretty much exclusively move in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Hell. Only at the very end of the game might players climb back towards heaven, depending on the letters of indulgence that they managed to collect up to that point.

The accumulation of these letters of indulgence is each player's primary goal. To this end, they take on the roles of different people: the Pope, the Emperor, the Merchant, or the Little Sinner. Each round, these roles in turn grant them access to different special actions. On their turn, players buy or sell goods on the market, visit the brothel to benefit from personal connections, or secretly donate money and goods to the church. Meanwhile, the construction of the game's three cathedrals proceeds. As soon as a cathedral is fully erected, the church will hand out the all-important letters of indulgence. However, only those who have donated the most in either of three categories will actually receive anything.

Many perks that can be used during the game require the players to sin. Sins are tracked by means of a tally stick and will move the player's poor soul closer to hell. The player who strikes the right balance and picks the right roles at the right time will be able to collect the most valuable letters of indulgence and might stand chance at winning the game. If a player has burdened themselves with too much sin, though, all will ultimately be for naught.

The setting is the streets of the future  not the real future, but the crazy apocalyptic future we all know and love. In this particular future, gangs of street thugs have (again) become enamored of the world of modern professional sports. Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right? And even if they didn't, they should have.

Thus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls  maybe more, we're not sure  two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.

Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a court out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the BUZZ card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!

Each round, you replace cards in your rack so their numbers read in any numerical progression from a low number at the front to a high one at the back (the racks hold the cards behind each other); achieving this ends the round. The cards are numbered from 1 to 60; you initially place them in your rack in the order they're dealt.

Players take on the roles of outlandish characters like the Postman, Rock Star, Evil Overlord, and Archaeologist and must attempt to escape from Infinity Dungeon.

Each turn of play, a room will be revealed from the room deck and read aloud. Each room contains a puzzle, trap, or monster to overcome. At this point, the party leader must describe how he will utilize his own character's powers, plus the powers of his willing allies, in order to get his team safely from this room and into the next.

Each player votes on whether they believe the plan is likely to succeed. After this point, a card is drawn and a random number printed on it is compared to the number of confidence votes the player received. If he meets this number or exceeds it, the GM must narrate how his plan succeeds. If he does not, the GM must narrate how the plan fails and results in his grisly death.

Players who die receive a new character class and get immediately back into the action. When the team completes a pre-determined number of rooms, they win!

18472,The Complete Wargames Handbook,1980,7.39062,32,5,0,0,0,0,Wargames,Book Wargame ,,"From the introduction:

Wargaming has had a remarkable four decades. Commercial wargames first appeared in the late 1950s, although commercial miniatures and naval gaming date back to the end of the 19th century. Board wargaming had something of a golden age in the 1970s, before being replaced by fantasy role playing games (RPGs) and computer games in the 1980s. In the 1990s computer wargames were covered in glitz, simplified and made into a mass market product. Many of the 70s era grognards don't recognize these games as wargames, but they are. And simple, glitzy wargames are the future. Not entirely, of course, there is also developing a via web based market for lower budget, but more accurate and detailed historical wargames. We'll never get back to the 70s, but with wargames established as a permanent part of the commercial gaming landscape, we can expect an unending stream of new and innovative ideas.

The first edition was published in 1980 by William Morrow.  The second edition was published in 1992, also by William Morrow (under various imprints, it appears).  
The third edition (titled just Wargames Handbook) was published in 2000 by iUniverse.

Dynamo: Dunkirk, 1940 is a strategic/operational-level simulation of the decisive middle phase of the battle for France. The first phase ended when the tanks of Panzergruppe Kleist emerged unscathed from the western end of the Ardennes Forest on 14 May, thus unhinging the entire Allied strategic plan. The third phase began on June 5, when the final drives into the heart of France were begun. For two weeks at the end of May, the Allies had a final chance to rebalance the situation. Had they succeeded in stabilizing a supplied bridgehead on the Flanders coast, or managed to smash the thinly-spread German mechanized formations while breaking out southward, all of subsequent World War II history would have been changed. Alternately, had the Germans succeeded in bagging the whole of the B.E.F., there would have been little or nothing to stop an Operation Sealion and no troops to send to North Africa.

Game has a 12 turn Campaign scenario, and a 7/5 turn No Halt Order scenario to examine the ramifications of Hitler's mistake. The ratio of playing area to unit quantity creates high-density combat and fluid gameplay situations. The simulation is at the intermediate level of complexity, and suitable for solitaire play

140524,The Daedalus Sentence,2016,7.10639,47,0,1,4,60,60,,Adventure Science Fiction ,Action Point Allowance SystemCo-operative PlayHand ManagementSimultaneous Action Selection,"The Daedalus Sentence is a cooperative escape game that challenges players to use limited actions and effective communication in order to flee from their captors and escape a dangerous and ever-changing prison. Use your actions to explore your surroundings, overcome guards, or change the layout of the prison itself - just be careful that the moves you make to save yourself don't doom a teammate!

In the year 2083, an alien race known as the Loctae descended on planet Earth, killing billions and capturing and containing the few million that remained. The survivors were sent to locations throughout the galaxy, to work as slaves or as subjects for genetic experiments. The most infamous of these locations, known as the Hive, is a Loctae space station orbiting Ganymede. Here, prisoners are harvested for their genetic material, which is used by the Loctae to make genetic hybrids engineered for aptitude in any skill the Loctae require. A few have tried to escape, but none have succeeded. Those who are not lost in the station's labyrinthine halls are recaptured by the station's guards and then moved to the front of the list of those who are to be processed. The failed escapees blabber about the twisted and spliced creatures that roam the corridors of the maze, as if they were in the Labyrinth of King Minos. The remaining survivors now call their plight The Daedalus Sentence, a grim tribute to the facility's designer.

As the months in The Hive wear on, fewer and fewer prisoners remain. Fearing their subjects would run out before their experiments were completed, the Loctae have confined the remaining prisoners in regenerative pods, so that the organs and marrow taken from the prisoners will regenerate with time. Though expensive, this set up was proving successful for the Loctae until a rogue meteor struck the station, damaging the ship's AI and releasing the bonds that kept the prisoners contained. Now the prisoners have a chance, likely the last one they'll ever have, to brave the halls of The Hive and escape to freedom.

The main feature of the game is its rotating board. The board has four rotating rings, with players starting in the center prison cells and making their way to the outer ring, where they must find the final exit to make their escape. When players start the game, the entire board will be hidden. As they move from the start location, they need to spend actions to flip over tiles in order to discover the layout of each ring. Their main objective is to find the gate to the next ring, but as they explore they will discover tiles both beneficial and perilous. The tiles may allow them to influence the movement of enemies or the maze itself, but they may also spawn additional enemies that will hunt for the players until subdued. If the players can make their way through all four rings, find the final exit, and escape together, they win!

Enemies will spawn throughout the course of the game, both as the result of exploring tiles and from drawn cards. Unlike many card-driven games however, the players have a glimpse into their future by way of the Theseus Device, which holds eight cards that determine how the rings and enemies will move in coming rounds. All eight cards start hidden, but through die rolls (and cards played from the hands of players in case of emergency), players see some of the cards to come. This allows for careful planning, as players try to anticipate how rings will line up in future rounds, as well as making sure they are not caught in the patrol of any passing enemies. When the game starts, only two cards will be activated per round, but as the players breach additional rings, the number of cards that will activate increases. When playing the recommended timed game difficulty enhancer, this leads to a frantic rush as players try to evade enemies and find the exit while planning ahead for the next activation sequence.

The Daedalus Sentence is designed to be played at a variety of difficulty levels, and players can mix-and-match the optional difficulty enhancers to achieve the perfect intensity level for their group. In addition to a four player co-op game, The Daedalus Sentence can also be played one-versus-all, with a player taking the role of the labyrinth and its minions.

To set up the game, thirty cards are shuffled and placed face-down in a 6x5 grid. Each card shows one of six witnesses on its back and a witness viewing one of the five suspects on its front. On a turn, the active player reveals two cards in the grid. If they match, the player then turns over a third card. If all three cards show show the same suspect, the cards are collected and placed face-up next to the grid. In all other cases, that player turns the cards face-down once again, then flips over one of the ten timing cards, each showing Sherlock's nemesis Moriarty.

If all ten Moriarty cards are flipped, then the players lose the game. If, however, the players remove cards from the grid until only three remain, they have successfully identified the culprit  that is, the suspect who remains  and can claim victory.

A competitive variant is included in the rules which have players competing to collect witness cards. An additional variant rewards points to the player who holds (or doesn't hold) the suspect eventually identified as the culprit.

Players run their businesses and try to adapt to the events of the period, all while helping building the fort Fredriksten, which will protect the city from repeated attacks from the Swedish king, Karl XII.

Each round, you roll your dice and use them to activate your buildings. Each building can only be activated by a certain die value, and will provide money, construction material, soldiers, or victory points. If you erect buildings with different dice values, you will be able to utilize your dice most efficiently. Also, you can customize your buildings according to your needs by upgrading them with different combinations of cards, increasing or changing their production, or changing their required dice value. Contribute to the building of Fredriksten to receive extra resources, and make sure to have your private army ready when Karl XII attacks.

Flip over one of the pattern cards to see which pattern you need to create. The green cards are easier than the blue cards. Then, you can either take turns bouncing your balls into the grid or bounce the balls all at once. If your balls create the pattern first, you win that card.

94123,The Forgotten Planet,2011,6.16781,96,2.3571,2,4,75,75,,Science Fiction Territory Building ,Action Point Allowance SystemArea Control / Area InfluenceTile Placement,"The search for energy crystals continues without respite throughout the universe! The Merchant guild is ready to pay outrageous amounts of money, and all the Seekers roam about to find them. Breaking news! The surface of the forgotten planet on the edge of the galaxy is full of them. In a few days, a new gold race will begin, with men replaced by robots that search, explore and fight to control the precious mineral!

The Forgotten Planet is a tile-laying management game in which tiles represent safe areas on a planetary surface on which robots walk and take other actions. These tiles also accumulate energy from the sun, then conduct it to robots, giving them (and the player) more actions if they absorb enough energy  so building and maintaining ownership of these tiles is fundamental in the game strategy. Players and robots use this energy to build new bases, discover mines, build walls to keep out other robots, push those same walls out of the way, produce more robots and much more.

If your robot falls out of contact with tiles you control, however, then it loses power and falls inactive for the round. Control of tiles is determined by the distance from a particular tile to each player's closest base; whoever is closest to the tile (with walls serving as barriers that players must walk around while counting distance) controls it, and the more tiles you control, the more energy you have available to you.

Thus, players need to maintain an energy connection for their robots while trying to extend their area of control on the planet's surface with their bases. They also need to control mines, of course, as that's how a player produces new resources, which are subsequently converted into new bases, sold for victory points (VPs) or converted into new robots.

The game ends when the playing area is filled with tiles or no land tiles remain in the supply. (Players can consume metal as one of their actions to speed along the endgame and crimp someone else's efforts to keep building.) Players then score points for the land and mines they control, with bonuses going to the player(s) with the most robots in play, the most common mines and the most bases. The player with the high score wins.

Using fluid and dynamic systems for integrating the fierce combat and rapid movements of the companies and battalions contesting the beaches, cliffs, swamps and bocage bordering the rough North Sea coast, players will find the easy rules to offer rich puzzles and surprising opportunities on the cross-map march to victory.

On the two western beachheads, the Americans faced problems galore and some of the worst terrain encountered by the Allies. It seemed that Murphys Law was in full effect: Everything that can go wrong will go wrong  and at the worst possible moment. Yet despite widely scattered air drops, confusion and stiff German resistance, an American victory was won and the beaches secured. However, the cost in lives of this close-fought campaign will see it always remembered as Bloody Omaha.

The board is hexagonal with each player having a path by which his pawns can visit his direct left and right neighbors. In addition, each side has a direct path to the center of the board. Players other than the direct neighbors could only be reached by traveling through the neighbors or the center.

Included in the game are 6 domestic army pawns for each player, 36 mercenary pawns, 12 ambassador cards, 6 lady cards, 50 coins and 2 dice. At the beginning, each player receives the 6 domestic army pawns, 1 lady, 2 ambassadors and 3 coins.

Combats are resolved without random chance by simple calculation of the difference between the number of pawns. 
Income is provided to the player on the basis of the number of spaces occupied by a single domestic pawn. Each player may offer alliance to any player and if accepted, ambassadors are exchanged. Alliance permits joint attacks and unlike some other games, alliances are law: allies absolutely cannot attack one another.

If you give the correct answer for a puzzle, both the creator and guesser score points  but if everyone guesses the answer, or conversely no one does, then the creator scores nothing. Who will find the ideal mix?

The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated or could have participated.

Two games included in this issue are: BUDAPEST 1956, covering the ill-fated rebellion in the Hungarian capital in late 1956; and BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA, the clashes between Cuban and South African mechanized forces in Angola in 1987 and 1988.

There are two players in each game. In BUDAPEST 1956 one player controls the Hungarian Rebels and possible NATO what-if reinforcements, the other controls the forces of the Warsaw Pact. In BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA one player controls the South Africans and their UNITA allies, the other the Cuban and MPLA forces.

In the Budapest game each hexagon on the map represents half a kilometer across, and each game turn represents one day. Soviet maneuver units are mostly battalions, with regiments for their artillery and assault guns; Hungarian rebel units are ad hoc groups; and NATO intervention, when playing that special alternative history scenario, are represented by US Pentomic battlegroups.

In the Angola game each hexagon on the map represents eight kilometers across, while each turn represents anywhere from one week of intensive combat to four weeks of refitting. Units on both sides are mainly battalions or equivalent groups of irregulars.

The game system is low-complexity (totaling about 13,000 words) and compares to the one used in last year's Middle East Battles: Suez '56  El Arish '67. There are 280 NATO-style (with some iconic) half-inch counters. Playing time between two experienced opponents of roughly equal skill levels will be about three hours per game. Designed by Joseph Miranda.

Cold War Battles: Budapest '56  Angola '87 was published in Strategy  Tactics magazine #235.

The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took pare in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this ways (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result.

Each player will control a six-member gang competing to survive with only their instincts, a quick draw, and dynamite.

The game is played in turns. Each player has a home base card in front of him. Each turn, the player whose turn it is flips open a card from the common deck. The other players now have a chance to react.


    If a Talkin Iron card is revealed, players can choose to make an offensive or a defensive move. If players want to take a shot, they can slap one hand on the Talkin Iron card and simultaneously make a pistol-finger with their other hand, pointing at any other player. Only one player gets to actually take a shot - the one who slaps the Talkin Iron card first. Instead of trying to slap the gun, players can slap into a home base by slapping any of the home bases on the table. Only one players hand can be in a home base at a time. Players who slap into a home base cant be hit by a player who takes a shot, and they can safely keep their hand on that home base until theyre forced to move.



    If a Big Gun card is revealed, players can slap it to take a shot or slap into a home base. Just like a Talkin Iron, only one player can use it to take a shot - the first one to slap the card and simultaneously point a pistol-finger at another player. Unlike a Talkin Iron, a Big Gun is extraordinarily destructive, and damages players even if theyre in a home base.



    If a Gold card is revealed, players can take the card into their possession by slapping it. If you point at another player while slapping the gold, the player you point at takes the gold instead. Gold is required to activate most gangs special powers.



    When a Move! card is revealed, everyone needs to slap into a home base. If a player is already in a home base, they need to slap into a new home base. The last player to slap into a new home base loses one member of their gang. If anyone mistakenly slaps the Move! card, they lose one gang member, everyone else is safe regardless of where they slapped, and the turn ends.


Players take turns until only one gang is left standing.

At the start of a round, a player lays an animal card from her hand in the center of the table and states the sum of all cards played. The next player does the same, making sure that all animal cards are visible. This continues until the sum of the animals played totals twelve or more. The player who laid the last card takes the stack, then places the animals in her diving bells based on the number on the cards. If you would lay a crab in a diving bell that already holds one or more octopi cards (and vice versa), you must discard one card of each type.

Once the deck rounds out, players finish the round, if possible, then sum the animals in their diving bells. The player with the highest total wins!

The most influential party is the one that becomes the center of gravity in the next cabinet. To achieve this, you need as many votes for yourself as possible, but more importantly, you need to have better relations with other parties than they have with each other.

Each turn, you play idea cards that move the parties' positions on one of the eight political scales (high tax/low tax, immigration/nationalism etc). Parties who move in concert may strengthen their relation; parties who don't risk weakening theirs. Every move gives the parties more or less favor with the eight voter groups (old/young, men/women etc), which determines the votes cast by the game's sixteen voters (representing every combination of the four voter groups).

The game is an act of balances: Stick out your neck enough to keep a clear profile and win voters that give you political weight, but co-operate enough to place this weight in the right position of the winning coalition.

Drang Nach Osten! is an historical game/simulation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 that lead to the gates of Moscow and ultimately to the destruction of the Wehrmacht and the fall of the Third Reich. Drang Nach Osten! is a complete game of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.

Game Components:


    Five 21 x 27 mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).
    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:
    Two Europa sheet 1
    One Europa sheet 2
    Three Europa sheet 3
    One Europa sheet 4
    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)
    One rules folder and cover.
    One set of charts and tables consisting of:
        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle
        One Soviet Order of Appearance
        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart
        One German Initial Order of Battle
        One German Order of Appearance
        One German Units Appearing Chart
        Two Combat Results Tables
        One Unit Identification Chart
        One Time Record Chart
        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart
    


Notes:

Each hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.

Five weary warriors, on a journey for a mysterious dungeon rumored to be filled with precious gemstones. But there is hitch: ferocious monsters are guarding the gems! If the warriors join forces they can defeat them. But the coward who, blinded by his greed, will not fight seriously might get his companions punished by the monsters! The warrior who will remain loyal and will betray at the right time is the genuine hero of this game.

In Dungeon Busters, the players take the role of heroes exploring dungeons and defeating monsters in search of treasures. In order to defeat a monster, every player simultaneously plays a power card face-down then reveals the values. If two or more players play the same value, they are all ignored. If players are defeated the player who played the lowest value should return some treasures as a penalty. If players succeed to defeat the monster, players can divide rewards but the player who played the lowest value will go first.

Earth in the early 20th century: The planet has faced many invasions in the past, but never has mankind faced an assault like this, as multiple Dalek armies descend from the skies, seeking to destroy one another and conquer the world.

Many years ago, an ancient artifact was hidden somewhere on the planet, an artifact that will enable the Daleks to reign supreme across the universe, defeating any who stand in their way. Such an object is so valuable that even the Daleks cannot agree how best to wield it, and have split into renegade armies, each as cunning and determined as the next.

In Risk: The Dalek Invasion of Earth, you'll play as one of five different armies, either classic (black, bronze or silver) or New Dalek Paradigm (red or yellow) as you invade Earth seeking the ancient weapon. Only once all opposition has been wiped out can you begin the search. Will you be the last Dalek army left? Watch out for the TARDIS sweeping round the board to defend Earth!

As you fight for supremacy, the Doctor will do his best to stop you, bringing peace to a different territory each turn, and if your army is not victorious by his eleventh regeneration, then the battle is over and all Daleks must retreat as the Oncoming Storm saves the Earth.

With special power cards to boost your forces or destroy your opponents' plans, and special missions to defeat other invading forces, this game of Risk is an epic battle for control of the Earth...and the universe.

Atthe same time, you're trying to assist other players in losing their chips by guessing a hidden word before they can.

Each round, one player draws an illustration card that shows six words on it, chooses one of those words, and tells all players which number he has chosen; each other player receives a hand of three question cards, then antes one chip into a central pot. (Question and illustration cards have text in Italian, English, German and French.) On a turn, a player either plays and reads a question card  which the player who holds the illustration card must answer as honestly as possible  or tries to guess the word hidden on the card. Before a player guesses, he can ante any number of chips into the pot. If no one else matches his ante, he claims all the chips in the pot without having to guess the word; if at least one other player antes, he must give his guess, winning the pot if correct.

When a round end, the next player chooses a word from an illustration card and the game continues. When one player runs out of chips, the game ends and the player with the most chips wins.

On your turn you may either play a new card face up or call one of your opponents. When you play a card, you are trying not to play the last card of that rank. For example, if you play a 5, you are declaring that someone's hand still contains a 5. If you have one, you know you're safe. If not, you're making an educated guess.

A call ends the hand. When you call another player, you are saying that they were wrong when they played their last card, and there are no more cards of that rank left in anyone's hand. If the caller is right, she wins the pot, plus a penalty equal to the rank of the card, paid by the called player. (For example, 7 coins for calling a 7.) If the caller is wrong, the called player wins the pot, and he wins the same penalty from the caller.

There are two ways to get ahead in Deadfall: You can catch people when they play the wrong cards, and you can trick others into calling you when you're safe.

How to Play
Deal 5 Gift Cards to each player.

1) When it is your turn, it is your birthday!  Everybody gives you a crappy gift from their hand.
2) You shuffle the cards, turn them over one by one, and pick the gift you dislike the most.
3) The player who gave you that gift gets a point.
4) Draw back up to 5 Gift Cards.  Play moves to the left.

The first player to 3 points wins.

When to Play 
Crappy Birthday is designed to be taken as a gift to a party instead of a bottle of wine or a 6-pack of beer.  The goal of Crappy Birthday is to get people talking, laughing, and having a good time as quickly as possible. Don't be surprised if some people dislike the same gift that other people at the table love, because the gifts were designed to start fun and interesting conversations.  Crappy Birthday is simple enough that a group of non-gamers can read the rules and start playing within a few minutes.  Or if people do not want to play at the party, they can have fun by simply looking at the cards and laughing at the pictures and funny concepts.

So the next time you are going to a party with non-gamers, consider bringing Crappy Birthday as a gift.

Based on the erotic comic of the same name by Phil Foglio, the game retains the humor of the comic, but the images are  less explicit. Where the comic is definitely rated  'X',  the card game's pictures, for the most part, could be seen in a PG-13 Movie. Since there is a PG-13 rated image on each card, however, the artwork would receive an R rating.

The basic mechanic of the game is laying out the cards in a certain pattern face down, flipping one of the cards, and then attempting to match the edges of the cards with edges of the same color. Each card has a different point total, and the first player to 100 points wins.

Each player brings his or her own deck to play, and the decks get hopelessly intermingled during play. Half the fun of the XXXenophile game is gaining cards that you did not originally have.

The artwork of the cards is NOT for young children, yet young adults of the age of fourteen or fifteen would enjoy it. The cards are not painted in an insulting way, and there is material for people of all sexual preferences within the artwork.

Cheapass Gamess James Ernest, the game designer who designed Kill Doctor Lucky and Button Men, created the design for play of the game.

91430,Schwarz Rot Gelb,2011,6.005,118,1.2857,2,6,20,20,,Real-time ,Pattern BuildingSimultaneous Action Selection,"Schwarz Rot Gelb is a quick-playing pattern-building game  well, anti-pattern-building really. The game includes 80 color cards and 30 point cards (valued -4 to 10); each color card has 1-4 words on it, with the words being one of five colors but printed in one of the remaining four colors. Thus, the card might have Gelb (yellow) printed twice, but in black ink.

Shuffle the color cards, then spread them out on the table. Reveal as many points cards as the number of players. Each player takes a starting card and placed it at the beginning of a row. Simultaneously, players start flipping over cards to find one that fits next to his rightmost card, with fits meaning that neither of the two colors on the rightmost card are repeated on the new card and the number of words showing on the two cards differ. If you draw a card that meets this description, add it to your row and draw again; if not, place it face-up on the table.

Once a player has a certain number of cards in his row  7-11 depending on the number of players  he calls Stop! All players check their card rows for errors, discarding any mistaken card and all cards played after it. The player with the longest row of cards claims the highest point card on display; the player with the second-longest row the next highest point card; and so on.

Shuffle the color cards for a new round of play. After five rounds, the player with the highest point total wins the game.

71889,Third and Long: The Football Card Game,2010,6.75,49,2.3333,2,2,60,60,,Card Game Sports ,Hand ManagementSimulationSimultaneous Action Selection,"From the back of the package:

Gather your players and face off for gridiron glory! 
Third and Long recreates the action of a pro football game. Two coaches take turns on offense and defense, calling plays and executing drives. Touchdowns, field goals, fumbles, interceptions, penalties, and big plays are all part of the exciting action. Join the fun as the teams of the Professional Football League compete for the Championship Trophy!


            
        
    


In Third and Long, two players take on the role of opposing coaches in a game of American Football.

Each coach chooses a team from the star players included in the game. Pre-made teams are provided for simplicity, or a draft with a salary cap can be held to form the teams. Teams do not have all 11 players represented, they simply comprise of the star players from the following skill positions: QB, RB, WR, LB, CB, S.

A coin flip determines who starts out on Offense and who will initially play defense. Players share two decks of play call cards. The coach on offense takes the Offensive Play Calls and the coach on defense takes the Defensive Play Calls.

Coaches choose their respective play calls in secret, revealing them at the same time. The interaction between the offensive and defensive play call determines the match up of star players involved in the play. Action Cards (which form each player's hand) are used to further influence the outcome of each play.

The game is made up of a series of drives. Each drive is made up of a randomly determined number of Key Moments (from 1 to 5). Key Moments represent those special times during a football game that mean the difference between success and failure. For each Key Moment, a play occurs. If the offense is able to win that number of plays in a row, they score.

If the defense is able to stop the offense on any of the Key Moments in a given drive, then a fourth down has occurred. Most of the time a punt will follow, but sometimes the coach on offense is desperate and will attempt to go for it.

Each game results in real football game-like scores, and uses nothing but cards (no extra components to keep track of field position or time on the clock). Interceptions, fumbles, big plays, injuries, field goals, touchdowns, safeties, extra points... its all in there!

In Avalanche at Yeti Mountain, players play dual-use cards  the same cards used to make up the ski slopes of Yeti Mountain  to determine their speed in a race down the mountain. If players collectively exceed the speed limit, which is determined by the number of players, the fastest players crash, only moving one space forward towards the goal. Players may also activate rocket jumps to overshoot the competition but at the expense of causing an avalanche to begin chasing them down the mountain. If that's not enough tension, rocket jumps are possible only if the Yeti, awoken from his slumber by all of the rocket-powered racket, doesn't attack and deactivate players' rocket-powered skis!

17691,Djambi,1968,7.56667,30,4,3,4,60,60,Abstract,Abstract Strategy Political ,,"Djambi, or Chess of Machiavelli is a game for 4 players that can be played with only 3. There also exists a 5-player version called Pentachiavel.

It is a game of treason. Each player is the leader of a political party composed of 9 pieces:
1 Leader
1 Journalist
1 Assassin
1 Provoker
1 Necromobile
4 Activists
who roam a 9x9square board where all squares are the same except the central one, called The Labyrinth.

All counters move as the Queen in Chess, except the Activist who moves the same but only for two squares.
A piece cannot move through another piece, whether alive or dead.

Object of the game: gaining absolute power, that is killing all other leaders.
To do this, all players have the weapons of the actual politics: manipulation, provocation, activism, recuperation, scandal and political crime. The course to power is not a gala dinner, so all pieces can be physically eliminated. In politics, a dead is as encumbrant as a living person, so all dead pieces are kept on the board, face down.

Dead pieces have no color.

The Labyrinth is the basement of the Legal Power, the road to Absolute Power. Only a Leader may stay on this square. It makes its parti play after each opponent. But there, it can be killed by nearly all other pieces.

The Leader: can kill any piece on the board by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other adjacent free square of the board, dead.

The Journalist kills a piece that is adjacent to any one of the 4 squares that share a common border with its square. It does this just after having moved. The body lies dead where it was killed. He must move at least one square before killing.

The Assassin, can kill any piece by taking its place. The piece is placed, dead on the place the Assassin was before moving.

The Provoker, mover of the living: can move any living piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, alive.

The Necromobile, mover of the dead: can move any dead piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead.

The Activists can kill a piece by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead. They CAN'T kill a leader in The Labyrinth.

These are most of the rules. You can find the rest (in French, sorry) at the link below.

The pieces consist of balls of two colours placed in a square grid, and players seek to connect the board sides of their colour with a visibly connected chain of pieces of their colour. The mechanism that makes the game three dimensional is that players can elevate balls onto 2x2 platforms formed by four existing balls already in play. In a novel twist, moves can make balls drop to change the connection on the board.

Don't own all the hubs? No problem  as long as you own the starting hub, you can give opponents points to use their hubs, but that might give them a greater share of the points from a World Trade Card than you get. Hmm, what to do?

To place a hub in an empty city, the player must discard 1-3 cards matching that city's color, with the number determined by the shape of the city. If someone else already has a hub in that city, you can pay double to place your hub on theirs; that player or another opponent can then pay triple to take possession; and so on.

On a turn, you either draw cards, place a hub (whether by discarding cards or playing a free hub card), or score a World Trade Card. The first player to collect 100 points wins.

From the back cover of the rule book:

THE WEBBIES WANT YOUR MIND...

OLYMPICA simulates the U.N. Mars raid to capture the Web Mind Generator from a heavily defended area near Nix Olympica's massive caldera. The Webbie revolutionaries are deep in their tunnel complexes surrounded by strong points and infantry. The raiders will use infantry, laser tanks, lifters and the tunnel blasting BOAR drill. If they fail man's future may fall to the telepathic, religion/machine Web Mind of Mars.

OLYMPICA is the clever tactical creation of Lynn Willis. His future history of the Martian revolution of 2206 hinges on the crucial U.N. raid. The game is easy to learn, fast playing, and challenging. Like the other Microgames, it is ideal for beginners and fun for pros. OLYMPICA is the perfect game for those who've never tried science fiction games.

Components for the game include a 24 page rules booklet, play counters, and hex gridded map of the Nix Olympica region.

Ships are divided into three sections: the front (bow), the middle (body), and the end (stern). During the course of the game, you will place supplies on the ships bows, while moving around their body pieces so that your clan has majority control of a ship when it sets sail. Stern pieces are used to show which ships have already set sail.

Each turn, the active player will perform one of the remaining available actions. Actions include: taking first pick of actions next round, rearranging ships' pieces (x4), placing bets on ships (x2), adding supplies to a ship (x2), increasing the value of supplies in the market, or setting sail.

When a ship sets sail, players will share its supplies in order of how many times their clan's shield appears on the body pieces of that ship. Starting with the player with the most shields, players will claim a supply token of their choice from the bow of the ship and place it facedown on their scoring circle. These supply tokens will score points based on their value in the market at the end of the game. Additionally, if a player placed a bet on the clan that had majority control of the ship, then they take their winning bet and place it facedown on their scoring circle.

The game ends after seven ships have set sail. Players calculate their final scores by adding together the value of their supply tokens with the value of their winning bets. The player with the most points wins.

36649,Aquarium,2011,6.23981,108,2,2,6,45,45,,Card Game ,Set CollectionSimultaneous Action Selection,"Aquarium offers high player interaction as the other players can  and will  use their action cards to alter the available fish that you can buy and the price that you have to pay for them.

Each player starts with a set of nine action cards and $15. The deck is shuffled, then set up with three or four Feeding time! cards shuffled into the deck at various points. On a turn, a player first turns up a card from the deck if the market is empty (as it is as the start of the game). Then the player looks at the fish and plant cards in the market and decides whether to pass or try to buy them. If he passes, he takes $2 from the bank and adds the top card to the market; if he wants to buy, all other players get to influence what's on the market and what the cards cost.

First, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 1 of a buy. These cards force the active player to add, remove or swap a card from the market or simply allow the card player to make a fish swap of his own! (Players can also pass, with all action cards but the pass being set aside.) Second, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 2 of a buy. These cards add or subtract 1 from the cost of the market, or double or halve the cost of the market. In the latter case, the player of the card receives money from the active player instead of those coins going to the bank.

Once the goods and the cost are set, the active player chooses to buy all the fish and plants on offer or none of them. The cost is equal to the sum of the card values, plus or minus any modifications, then doubled or halved as appropriate. All purchased cards go into a player's personal aquarium. If a player has two identical fish, he can move them to a separate breeding tank where they will earn him 1-3 coins each turn.

Each time a Feeding time! card is revealed, players reveal one food cost card at random, then pay money equal to that cost times the number of stars on fish and plants in their aquariums. Any fish not fed starve and float away to the big toilet bowl in the sky. Each plant in an aquarium reduces the food cost by one.

After the final Feeding time!, players count the stars on their non-breeding fish, then receive bonuses for collecting all colored fish of the same size, all three sizes of fish of the same color and different varieties of plants. The player with the most stars wins.

Here, fishy, fishy, fishy...

Castle Assault seeks to break the mold of traditional card games and organically extracts the most enjoyable parts of these different genres and distill them into a standalone concept. Castle Assault plays in about 30 mins, and is for 1 or 2 Players.

Each Player controls a Castle on either side of the Battlefield with 10 Health and a Hero outside of the Battlefield.  Players play Units from their hand to the gameboard and these Units physically move toward the opposing Castle based on the Abilities of that Unit and your choices with the intent to bring your opponent from 10 to 0 Health.  Should you destroy your opponents Castle or destroy their Hero you win!

More details please - a Battle Card Game with tons of combat and strategy.  Card combat is fast and furious; every time two opposing Units touch each other in the same column, they Engage in combat (which is often), and can happen either during the Move Units step or during the Open Phase by Charging or using an Ability described on your Units.  Combat is resolved immediately with Unit cards exchanging their combat values at the same time (with no luck involved).  Should either Unit have a higher attack number then the Armor + Health of the opposing Unit, that Unit is destroyed.  Should a Unit smash the opposing Castle without a defending unit, that Unit attacks the opposing Castle directly lowering that Castles Health by the Unit's attack value.

Your Hero grants some bonuses throughout the game and you can even join the Battlefield to turn the tide, however should your Hero be destroyed you immediately lose the game.  As you progress through the 1-Player Campaign and complete feats or heroism you can level up and customize your Hero based on the way YOU play. 
 Every deck is also customizable meaning your Unit selection can be optimized before battle, but note this is not a 'pay-to-play' type game.  You receive all the cards from all warbands including the 1-Player warband in the Core Edition (NO BOOSTERS).

Most Units have Abilities to; keep them alive, move more quickly, laterally move, resurrect, summon allies, surprise, dissipate, and damage the opposing Castle from afar.  You may feign attacks, play Commands to make your Heroes more powerful in a myriad of methods to tactically breakdown your opponent.

The 1-Player Campaign provides a Right-Outta-the-Box Experience with 9 Scenarios culminating in a final boss showdown.  1-Player mode operates by Monsters auto-populating in the opposing Castle with your victory condition changing every Scenario including outright smashing the opposing Castle, destroying a boss overlord, or surviving the onslaught.  With 9 Scenarios per 6 warbands it creates 54 different challenges  (9 campaigns x 6 warbands = 54 games).

Set in a post-alien-invasion-of-Earth universe, the squads, heroes, and tanks of Earth's Militia battle against powerful aliens with enhanced power armor, hover tanks, Mechs (Ya, I need a better name.), and spider-like robots.

In each turn gamers draw up to a four card hand and may play a card, sometimes more, in each impulse. The cards activate units to move, fire, assault, and use special powers, such as explosive rounds, telekinesis, and more. Special cards, such as critical hit or bullet storm, can also enhance a unit's attacks.

Each turn continues until three end turn cards have been drawn. Players then choose one card from their hand to keep, the administrative markers are removed from the board, and a new hand is dealt to each player. The players use that new hand, or the card kept from the previous turn, to bid for initiative in the new turn.

Night of Man ships with numerous scenarios, as well as a point system that allows gamers to put together their own battles in no time flat.

2567,Who Stole Ed's Pants?,2001,5.73439,278,1.5333,3,4,60,60,,Card Game ,Take That,"An overview from the rules:

Who Stole Ed's Pants? is a friendly game of fraud, treachery and injustice. You'll play two rounds of the game, and after each one, every player will accumulate points based on how guilty they look and add it to their running total. At the end of the second round, a winner and a loser will be decided. The game centers on the three factual categories of the game:

When: The time of the theft
Where: The location of the crime
Who: A partial description of the thief

Because no one has bothered to ask Ed about the details of the crime, police have nothing but wild rumor and rampant speculation to go on. You'll be able to change the alleged facts of the case and alter the focus of the investigation in each of these three crime categories.

At the same time you'll plant evidence on other players. If a round ends while the case facts match up with the evidence planted on you, the police will grow suspicious. Too much incriminating evidence after each round will land you in the big house for the theft of Ed's pants.

In a 4-player game, players sitting across from each other are on the same team and you will win or lose together as accomplices. In a 3-player game, it's everyone for themselves.

Army Group North, commanded by Field Marshal von Leeb, was given an important strategic goal  Target: Leningrad! To capture this second capital of Russia and the birthplace of Soviet communism would deal a severe psychological blow to the enemy, protect the northern flank of Army Group Center, and bring an overland route into Finland, Germanys Axis ally in the north. Hitler would obsess on the capture of Leningrad.

Taking Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in their Baltic drive, as well as the north regions of Byelorussia, the Germans found themselves facing stubborn resistance from the Red Army and the Soviet Baltic Sea Fleet. Several Soviet counteroffensives were launched, but the Baltic States were soon overrun and operational objectives such as Talinin eventually fell to the German Blitzkrieg. The Soviets would improvise defensive barriers like the Luga Line, but Germans kept coming...

Target: Leningrad is a new game from legendary game designer Frank Chadwick, iterating the Campaigns in Russia game system used in Battle for Moscow (first edition), The Arduous Beginning and Objective: Kiev. Featuring countless opportunities and variations, Target: Leningrad presents an endlessly fascinating series of puzzles, filled with rich historical narrative in every move, as Leningrad becomes the focus of this great campaign.

The game ends - as usual - when all tiles have been used up, and the two boats fartherst down the river score some bonus points (depending on the number of players).

3359,Anagrams,1910,6.49057,53,2,2,6,45,45,,Word Game ,,"The players shuffle the letters in the pool thoroughly. Each player, in turn, draws a letter tile from the pool and places it face up on the table. These letters are available to all players on their turn.

Before starting play it should be decided that either 3-letter, 4-letter or 5-letter words are to be established as the basis of play.

Then the first player draws a letter from the pool. Keeping it hidden, he tries to form one word of 2 or more letters with the letter in his hand and with at least one or more of those letters face up on the table. He may also form the word with only the face up letters and not use the letter in his hand. Whenever a player forms a word, his turn ends.

If a player cannot form a word, or if he forms one but doesn't use the letter he has drawn from the pool, he must discard this letter at the end of his turn. The letter is discarded by putting it face up with the other turned up letters on the table. Then the next player moves.

When a player forms a word, he places it in front of him facing it to the center of the table. This is done so the other players can easily see it. It gives them the chance to steal words. As the game continues and players gather words, they may steal the words from one another. This is done by taking all the letters of another player's word and adding one or more letters to it to completely change that word's meaning. The letters added to a word in stealing may be the one drawn by the player from the pool or one or more of those face up.

Adding S to make a word plural (or ED or ING) does not change the meaning of a word and cannot be used to steal a word. Any letters at all, however, can be used in stealing a word if the new word formed is entirely changed in meaning.

Players should make their own words harder to steal by adding letters to them and making them more complex. This counts as a complete turn and is as important as forming new words.

When all of the tiles have been drawn from the pool, players, continue in turn to try to form words using the face up letters. The game ends when there are no more face up letters, or when no player is able to move using the remaining face up letters. Each player counts the number of tiles in all of the words he has formed in front of him.

The winner is the person who has first obtained eight (8) words. The game is not over until ALL players have had an EQUAL number of turns.

If at the end of an equal number of turns there is more than one player with eight (8) words, count the number of tiles in those 8 words. The player with the most tiles wins. If the number of tiles in the 8 words is equal, then the game ends in a tie.

Chicago, 1925. It is the time of Prohibition. 4 opposing gangs, each with 9 gangsters want to bring the city under their control. By playing out rows, each of which consist of 6 gangsters, players try to gain a majority through their most valuable gangsters. But careful! To gain powerful positions, sometimes sharpshooting is needed. The goal of the game is to become the most powerful of all, Al Capone. Tactics, strategy and cold-bloodedness will be required if you want to be celebrated as the boss of bosses in this game.

What gives the game its flair, apart from the real metal munitions, is the deft touch of the illustrator as well as court artist Robert Nippoldt. From corrupt mayor William Hale Big Bill Thompson to Boss of Bosses Al Scarface Capone, all of the major gangsters of this lead-filled time are represented. The well-known portraits are taken from the eponymous book Gangster. The Bosses of Chicago by Robert Nippoldt, and give the game a sheen of authenticity. The book has received awards from the German Designer Club, Buchkunst Fund as well as the Red Dot Design Award 2006.

Bullenparty uses two decks of cards: one numbered 1-100 (with each card bearing 1-7 bullheads) and the other with ten Bull cards, bearing 4-7 bullheads. At the start of the game, each player receives five number cards at random along with a zero card.

At the start of each round, lay out one row of number cards for each player, with two cards in each row. Each turn, all players secretly choose a card in their hand, then reveal them simultaneously. Whoever played a number card chooses all of the cards in one row and adds them to his hand, discarding the card used for bidding. Whoever played a zero card adds a card from the top of the deck to a remaining row, then reclaims the zero card. All players who played zero cards then repeat this process. If a row reaches five cards in length, add the top card from the Bull deck to this row; if all rows end in Bull cards, then players must play number cards.

After a round ends, all players must reduce their hand to five number cards, playing any excess cards in hand onto one or more stacks in front of them, with cards being played in ascending order. Bull cards are placed separately.

Players then create new rows and play another round. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards to finish the round, after which the game ends. Players then score positive points for Bull cards and for the bullheads in the pile with the most bullheads; all other bullheads are negative points. The player with the highest total score wins.

2666,A Mighty Fortress,1977,6.27363,91,3.2,6,6,240,240,Strategy Wargames,Renaissance Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterVariable Player Powers,"Subtitle of the game: Reformation and Counter-Reformation, 1532-1555

On the box cover: The time is 6 February 1531.

One of the games in SPI's Power Politics series.

From the publisher:

Recreating the turbulent era of the Reformation, from the viewpoint of political/religious interaction and military activity. A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.

A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.

The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.

The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.

A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.

Other notes:

Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.

The Best of Quick Thinking, Strategic Play and Fun in One Great Game!

What makes Wordigo special?

Simultaneous Play
In Wordigo, everyone plays at the same time. No waiting for other players to complete their turns. Each player gets his/her own playing board and own set of letter tiles  4 sets of each. Players race against the clock and other players to complete all the paths on his/her own board before time runs out.
Versatility
Not only are there 4 copies of the same playing board, there are 4 different game board designs offering varying degrees of difficulty. Plus, by making use of the alternative rules of play, children can easily play with adults.

Highly Strategic
Wordigos vowels, with their arrows and bonus markings of 2x, 3x, 4x and 5x, allow for a highly strategic, creative and unique way of scoring word points (see Demo).
Solo  Team Play
Wordigo is also unique in that a person can easily play challenging solitaire matches. With multiple players, team play is great fun as players compete against other teams to form words and attempt to complete all the paths before time runs out.

Each player may play up to three cards from their hand on their turn.

Strive to land on the most precious gems, and hang on for a ride. The roll of the dice determines your moves, but your strategy determines your fate.

You finally land on a diamond - and a ruby and two emeralds. But how do you keep them from being taken by the other players? You must roll a GEMLOK to make them yours to keep.

Meanwhile, the other players will keep coming and they will not stop. They want those precious gems, and will stop at nothing to get them. Nothing is certain until you roll a GEMLOK. Even then, each player must secure eight gems, and will encounter significant player strategy along the way before securing their fortune.

Players may find themselves forced to lock in a low value gem or none at all. Avoid being bumped by other players, and don't hesitate to bump them first. There is also the strategy of bumping oneself into a more favorable position. So much fun, interaction and strategy built into Gemlok. Enjoy your Family and Friends as you play Gemlok and HAVE FUN!

Rome at War: Queen of the Celts

In the year 43 AD, Roman legions splashed ashore in Kent, unopposed by the Britons led by Caractus, who had sworn to repel them. The Emperor Claudius had dispatched Aulus Plautius and 45,000 men to conquer the mist-covered island where Julius Caesar had failed almost a century earlier.
 Over the next 40 years, Roman would clash with Celt in a series of battles that neither realized would determine the future of Western civilization.  The Romans broke the Britons, whose furious courage could not match Roman discipline. The island would pass under Roman rule for the next several centuries, implanting a Latin-oriented culture and shoving Celtic ways to the very fringes of Europe. All that would remain were their legends; not least among them the fiery leadership of Boudicca, warrior-queen of the Iceni and resolute enemy of Rome.

The Rome at War series covers Roman battles against both their neighbors and each other. The first game, Rome At War I: Hannibal at Bay, covered the last battles of Carthages favorite son. The second, Rome at War II: Fading Legions, focused on the empires latter years, when it was beset by barbarian invasion, an implacable rival, and civil war.

Rome at War: Queen of the Celts is the third installment in the series. Rome has outstanding heavy infantry, good light cavalry (provided by her allies) and even an elephant. The Britons depend on the fury of their Celtic charge, and also chariots and slingers. Plus they have Druids to help inspire them. 
 There are nine scenarios, or game situations, included in Queen of the Celts.

42641,Slouch Hats & Eggshells,2012,7.27419,31,2.8571,1,2,0,0,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"Slouch Hats and Eggshells: The Allied Invasion of Syria  Lebanon - 1941, recreates the World War II campaign in French-held Syria and Lebanon, historically from early June 1941 through mid-July 1941. One player will control the Axis forces (Vichy French, French colonial troops, and Germans), while his opponent controls the Allied forces (British, Commonwealth, Free French, etc). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. One player wins by capturing certain specified objectives while his opponent wins by avoiding those victory conditions.

When Free French leader Gen. de Gaulle visited the Middle East in April 1941 he forced a political crisis by demanding the occupation of Syria. As a result London ordered an offensive to place all of Syria and Lebanon under Free French control. Sadly, such posturing caused Allied command staffs to hold unrealistic views of what the ensuing occupation would look like. Certain authorities believed the Vichy French in Syria would offer only token resistance and their defense would collapse like an eggshell. The thinking held that Vichy forces could be won over with wine and coffee along with displays of the Australian slouch hat. Instead, the Vichy-led troops fought ferociously from the start.

Players should feel free to combine play of this game with that of Rommel's War, published by L2 Design Group. Both games include the same historical moment, have identical scales, and have some of the same historical units. It is natural that players would want to explore more historical alternatives with combined play. To facilitate such game play, this game uses many of the same rules, charts, and tables found in Rommel's War.

Game Scale:
Game Turn: 10 days
Hex: 10 miles / 16 kilometers
Units: Company to Brigade

Game Inventory:
One 22 x 34 full color map
Two dual-side printed countersheets (96 -  5/8  20 -  1.3/16 counters)

Lees summer offenses (1862  1863) at the corps/division level using hidden deployment of units and dummy counters and one week turns.  Confederate forces must go on the attack to win while the Union army struggles to protect Washington, DC and Baltimore.  The map is very basic and players each have about 20 units each to control, creating a game that focuses on Civil War-era strategy rather than details and chrome.

Confederate units are divisions while Union units are corps and cavalry are represented by brigades.  Rules cover dummies units, cavalry probes and screens, forced marches, rail movement, and leadership and command issues while the units take losses by steps.  Although not visually appealing, Lee Moves North is a playable and subtle game of two Civil War campaigns at the operational level.


Uses a system similar to SPI's The Wilderness Campaign: Lee vs. Grant, 1864.

But the longer you play, the more you realise they actually made a whole new game. You start with more money than usual, which gives you the idea you will last longer (with a bit of luck maybe). The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.

But not so fast. Everybody wants to win of course. And with the 80 extra buildings they added to the game, nothing was ever so uncertain. On every property you can build residential or industrial buildings. The first is not protected against negative buildings (hazards) and requires positive buildings otherwise the property becomes worthless. The industrial buildings on the other hand are protected but they cost twice as much! So you will have to make choice. And the added electronic device will, besides timing deals, always indicate how many buildings you can exactly make.

There is also no community chest anymore, only chance. But they have changed the content of the cards which makes the game less predictable and more fun to play- watch your buildings being crushed because of an earthquake or not getting your rent because a player evades the number thrown with the dice.

Besides these changes, there are many more twists to the game which I will not reveal here but be sure that they all add to the greatness that once was and that now has even become better.

Before the game starts, each player secretly assigns a value of 1, 3, 5 or 'milk' to each of the four pots of his color, then players take turns placing their pots on the board.    Each player's turn consists of rolling dice and moving his devils appropriately, either trying to get to another player's pot, or carrying one back to the kitchen.  If a devil brings milk to the kitchen, it explodes, and the devil carrying it is removed from the game.  A large plastic stove in the middle of the board is the game's exciting gimmick, and comes into play when two opposing devils share the same space and start dueling.  Each player takes turns pushing the plunger that forms the oven's stovepipe, and eventually a large devil pops out, deciding the winner!

Luther criticized the selling of indulgences and stated that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the gospel. The Protestants soon incorporated doctrinal changes such as Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) and Sola Fide (faith alone). These changes turned out to be not only theological, but also influential in the Reformation in other ways: the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded people's faith in the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much of traditional thought. The Roman Catholic church responded with a counter-reformation initiated by the Council of Trent.

In the two-player game Sola Fide: The Reformation, by the renown design team of Jason Mathews and Christian Leonhard, players attempt to install Reformation in the Holy Roman Empire or try to prevent it, battling the Holy Roman Empire's Imperial Circles.

They face the challenges of restoring Warsaw destroyed during World War 2, bringing back the citys prestige and importance in the fields of administration, culture and industry.

The goal of the game is to rebuild Warsaw after the war and develop the city. The players have to get concrete, use the materials acquired from the debris of the destroyed Capital and various social funds that were used in reality during the rebuilding of Warsaw. However, not only the reconstruction itself is important, but also the appropriate location of the objects on the city map and competent delegation of the members of ones studio to work. One of the several tactical elements of the game is managing the project cards and workers. Using their extra abilities may be the key which will benefit one player and make the work much harder for another. But even for a moment they should not forget about acquiring building materials from prefabricated elements and building new panel blocks.

The game covers the period of thirty-five years, so in subsequent stages many various tasks appear. They are related to political doctrines, tendencies in architecture as well as the general economical and developmental situation in Poland in the given period. But the most important feature of the game is that each time the players are able to rebuild Warsaw in a different way from this known from history. They decide whether the historical rebuilding plan will be realized and where  if at all  the Palace of Culture and Science will stand. The players also have an access to the plans that were never realized, both from the Six-Year Plan and later urban development concepts. The game includes a futuristic element, too  the players have plans of two subway lines at their disposal. Such plans actually existed in post-war Warsaw, but they were never realized due to economic problems. In this game it is possible.

(Glorious Adventures in Science Loosely Involving Generally Historical Times) is a set of miniatures rules for conducting skirmishes in the Victorian era. Bands of stouthearted Extras are led by Main Characters -- from the streets of London to the hills of South Africa and from the glorious charges of the Crimea to the maelstrom of the American Civil War. The rules are written with the works of Victorian science fiction authors in mind, such as Wells, Verne, and Haggard. In addition to standard colonial era actions, special rules are included for adding various science fiction elements to the plot, including, but not limited to, steam conveyances, fabulous inventions, glorious weapons, and strange creatures from the depths of the jungle or the core of the Earth.

In G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T., units generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters. A player normally controls one or two units. A player may also control one or two vehicles and their crews. G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. includes rules for creating Main Characters with somewhat more detail than the Extras. The games then are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.

Command and control is accomplished through a card-based turn system. Movement is based on moving individual figures. Firing is done by figure as well, but the firing procedure is very quick. Morale is accomplished through a unique, stateless system that treats loss of cohesion in an novel way.

Detailed charts are provided for creating personal weapons, heavy weapons, vehicles, and fantastic creatures. The concept used in G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. is that of imperfect mechanization -- machines don't always work as intended. This often adds a bit of excitement and humor to the games.

The authors of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules. Instead the rules allow for the generation of vehicles, weapons, and creatures that allow groups of players to tailor the rules to their perception of Victorian science fiction. As a result, the rules are flexible.

The system now includes The G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. Compendium which includes most of the expansion books.  It adds some new material and revises some of the old material.  It is 190 pages of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. information.

The German Player is on the offensive, attempting to win the game by eliminating or isolating British units and seizing key terrain on the map.  The British Player is on the defensive, first attempting to prevent the German player from achieving that side's objectives, then escaping off the map with the bulk of the BEF still intact.

Each hexagon on the map represents approximately one mile from side to opposite side.  Each game turn equals about two hours.  The units of maneuver in the game are mostly regiments for the Germans and battalions for the British.  Each full-strength German infantry regiment contained some 4,000 men and three-dozen cannon; each full-strength British battalion had some 2,000 men and 18 cannon.

Since this battle was fought over only two days, and both sides' forces entered pretty much fully supplied, there are no supply rules.  Similarly, there are no replacements.  And finally, there are no concentric assault rules, since the British were too proud to become scared when they were surrounded, and the Germans wer too inexperienced to know they should be scared when they were surrounded.

After each roll, the player can set aside any dice they like and reroll others.

If the player succeeds with the challenge, they write the sum of the dice on that line of their scoresheet; whoever scores the highest sum on this line earns three points, while the next two highest scores earn two and one point. If the player doesn't hit the target or doesn't like the score obtained, they can use the topmost empty Kribbeln line on their scoresheet  but each Kribbeln score must be higher than the one before or else they must enter a null total for that line, scoring no points.

SEALORDS: The Vietnam War in the Mekong Delta. (SL) is a low-to-intermediate complexity, two-player, operational simulation (with important tactical undertones) of riverine combat the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. There are two players: the Free World, including US, South Vietnamese and other allies; and the Communists, including Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army forces. The objective of the Communist player is to infiltrate men and supplies via the Mekong Delta's many waterways, while also attacking critical Free World bases and towns across the region. The Free World player is attempting to prevent that infiltration while also conducting an offensive against Communist formations and bases.

Each player has available several types of riverine and ground units, as well as air units for the Free World player. The Communist player can make use of special rules representing that side's advantage in intelligence and local guerrillas. The system uses an 'operational impulse' system. That is, a player moves and fights with one of his forces, followed by his opponent doing the same with a force of the other side. Every operation requires the expenditure of command points.

SL has several different scenarios, each covering a critical period of operations: Game Warden (the early years), Tet (the Communist general offensive of 1968), and SEALORDS (the Free World counteroffensive of 1969-70).

Each map grid square equals 6.21 miles (10 km) across, and each full game turn represents a month. Units of maneuver are mostly battalions and battalion equivalents.

Each player starts with 22 wooden blocks and tries to become the first player to get rid of all their blocks.  The blocks come in 4 different sizes (each size is a different color).

On your turn, you place blocks in a single stack on the high side of the seesaw.  You have to keep placing blocks until either the seesaw tips or the stack you are building collapses.  If you tip the seesaw and then blocks fall off, those blocks are given to your opponent. However, if the stack collapses before the seesaw tips, then you get stuck with any blocks that fall onto the table.

In either case, any blocks that stay on the seesaw are left there to complicate future turns.

Steady hands and a little knowledge of physics helps.

The game expands the idea from 'Deutschland' to a European map, where the players have to locate cities, rivers/lakes, landscapes/regions and historical sites. In doing so, the players can decide how much risk they take by choosing how detailed they get in their localization attempt.
The systems works more or less like betting at roulette; the smaller the region you guessed, the higher the return. But if you make a mistake you get nothing at all!  
Europa is to 'Deutschland' what 'Ausgerechnet, Uppsala!' was to 'Ausgerechnet, Buxtehude!'. It just takes the game to another geographical level. 
The only major difference is the catch-up mechanism: Instead of allowing trailing players to jump over occupied fields on the point track, the game reuses the 'barriers' from 'Globalissimo'. The leading player has to guess the country of a certain location in order to advance further on the point track. Trailing players can then proceed without such a trial. Additionally, the last player may make a bonus guess by correcting or detailing another player's guess for a bonus point.

If a boat is captured by the pirates, the players have a chance to rescue the prisoners... at the cost of valuable time and supplies.

This cooperative game is played on a board which shows the route from Adventure Island back to the player's home town. Each player starts with a boat on Adventure Island, and two pirate ships are placed along the route. The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls two dice, then choses one die to use for his own boat and one die to use for one of the pirate ships. Both are moved as many places forward as the selected die shows. At certain points, the player can have his ship take a hidden route, which is not used by the pirate ships.

If a pirate ship passes a boat, or if a boat passes a pirate ship, the boat is captured and placed on Pirates' Island. Other boats can free it if they manage to land on one of the rescue spaces on the track; the rescued boat is then returned to that same space.

When all boats have reached the home town, the players have won the game. However, if some ships are captured while all other ships have reached the home town, the players lose.

The difficulty level can be increased by giving each player two or three boats instead of one. The greatest challenge is the Grand Adventure, in which each player has three boats, there is a third pirate ship, and each player may hide on the hidden routes at most five turns during the game.

The 2011 AMIGO edition is part of its kologisch + Kooperativ (Ecological  Cooperative) line of games.

A potion has at least three ingredients: 1 special supply, 1 herb, and 1 or more gems.  The result is either part of the Elixir or another potion that can help wizards during play.  For example, Speedy Soda lets you move around the board faster.

Beware of the street.  Every time you stop there, you meet a mysterious stranger.  Some are friendly.  But others will try to attack you!

In fact, you are a particularly dangerous one, as you are a Necromancer with a business plan. Your zombies will dig up and loot valuables from graves, and while they're there, they can also grab fresh body parts so you can make MORE zombies to dig up MORE graves. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, it's so good that other Necromancers are now competing with you for the choice cemeteries!

Players start with zombies of varying values.  They take turns placing zombies in specific location to dig up graves, steal from opposing laboratories and vaults, and to attack other player's zombies to try and prevent them from digging or stealing (and possibly dismember the opposing zombie beyond further use).

Once all the zombies have been placed, zombies still in position will steal body parts or treasure from opponents, and those set to dig will dig the row, column, or specific space of the graveyard they are assigned to.  If you are competing for spaces in the graveyard (which is the norm), players compare the combined brainpower of their digging zombies, and the higher value gets to the contents of the grave first.

Then you may use your new-found corpse pieces and equipment to assemble new zombies to do your bidding!

The goal is to have the highest total in treasure and unused body parts at the end of the game.

Creeper is an abstract strategy game which belongs in the same family as Hex/Twixt. That is, two players attempt to link two sides of the board with a chain of pieces.

Players: 2 only. One plays black, the other white.
The Bits:

     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.
     32 Othello disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.
     A board made up of a 66 square grid of octagons. 




The game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.
On his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.
A move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.

In the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). 
The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.

To set up the simmering cauldrons at the start of the game, you place the top six cards of the deck into three columns of two cards. The special actions consist of jokers and enchantments, and two of these cards are placed face-up; a joker can replace any ingredient, while an enchantment allows you to:


     Select one ingredient of your choice 
     Switch up to five ingredients of the same color with an opponent
     Steal one ingredient from the cauldron 
     Discard up to five ingredients


During your turn, you take one of three actions:


     Add ingredients: Place one ingredient in each cauldron, after which if each cauldron has two ingredients of the same color or value, you can take one ingredient from any cauldron.
     Taste a potion: Take all the ingredients of the same color or value from one cauldron.
     Cast a spell: Discard the proper mix of ingredients in order to cast a spell. The big Megalos, for example, is composed of nine ingredients of a single color and is so rare that casting it allows you to win the game instantly. The Pentos requires five different ingredients of the same value, and casting it ends the current round. The Mikkros, composed of three ingredients of the same value or three of the same ingredient in consecutive values, allows you to take two special action cards.


When a player casts a Pentos or the ingredient deck runs out, the round ends, although players with ingredients in hand can still play card suits of the same color. Each ingredient in a suit earns you 1 Ko, while an isolated ingredient is worth its value in Kos.

After three rounds or a Megalos spell, the game ends. In the latter case, the Megalos-casting player wins; in the latter, the player with the most Kos is immediately turned into a toad.

20090,Double Agent,2005,5.82296,198,1.75,2,2,20,20,,Bluffing Card Game Spies/Secret Agents ,Secret Unit DeploymentVariable Player Powers,"From the author's homepage:

Double Agents is published as an insert in the french boardgame magazine Des Jeux sur un Plateau, in the October 2005 issue (#20). In this card game, each player is trying to manipulate five double agents with ambiguous loyalty, and to guess which ones are working for him and which one for his opponent. Hidden information, face down cards... it's a two player game, but it's also a classical Ludo or Bruno game, where you don't know what is sophisticated bluffing and what it just global chaos.

From an earlier description on Bruno Faidutti's website:
Double Agent is based on a simple idea : each player knows each agent's loyalty to him, but doesn't know his loyalty to his opponent. In such an ambiguous situation, it's hard to decide who you can trust with your precious top-secret documents, which must not end in enemy hands. Each player plays cards face down on his side of the gameboard.

Feudal Lord is a multi-player game that simulates the history of Japan in its age of civil wars in the latter half of the 16th  century, from rivalry between lords to unification under one leader (shogun).

The 1,300 diecut counters represent the historical factions(clans), combat units, fortresses, leaders, and ships that fought throughout this period.  It even includes gold bullion counters. Beautiful full color maps and counters, 8 sets of charts, cards, 20 scenarios, comes with counters trays and 2 dice.

In this game, each player becomes a famous feudal lord, and attempts to unify provinces, expand territory, and become the unifier of Japan.
Clans conduct war with other players or neutral clans. Administration and diplomacy is important, along with military operations.
In addition to the strategy, event card and the ability of leaders have a significant impact on game play.

The game has two types of scenarios: historical and free set-up. Historical scenario is based on the actual territory and leaders. Free set-up scenarios will be started with any province and random selected leaders. Nominal purpose is the unification of Japan, but most scenarios will determine the winner by the total wealth of controlled provinces.

While militarily a stalemate, the war consolidated Prussia's dominance of central Europe until its defeat at Jena in 1806.

The game is designed for two players or two teams. One player or team controls the Prussian Allied side, the other runs the Coalition side. The objective is to gain control of as many central European fortress cities as possible without destroying the international balance of power. Each side has a number of military units with which to attack enemy forces and gain control of Fortresses. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation.

17996,Anno Domini: Seefahrer & Flieger,1999,7.2,30,1,2,8,45,45,,Bluffing Card Game Educational Humor Party Game ,Card Drafting,"Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.
If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.

Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this aint no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because its full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.

Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.

The Set Anno Domini - Seefahrer  Flieger contains historical events related to sailors  airmen, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.

Mate is a game of perfect information played with a 20 card deck. It is played in matches of two rounds and rounds of two games. Players exchange hands between the two games of each round, which eliminates luck of the draw. A winning move or mate consists of playing a card that the other player cannot follow either in suit or rank. A point score for the game is calculated from the rank of the mate card and the total number of moves in the game (the more the better). The player with the most points wins the match.

The players must prevent the Dark Legion and one of its vile leaders from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings news of monstrous foes and terrifying events as the heroes explore the modular Citadel. Promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry and abilities, while secret missions can cause chaos for the heroes!

The narrative-led design of Siege of the Citadel updates and balances the gameplay of the original release and adds new campaigns based on major events from the Mutant Chronicles universe and new creatures, such as the Praetorian Stalkers.

During each mission a different player will control the Dark Legion forces, while their fellow players attempt to fight their way through the citadel.

Players select one of five factions (each with a unique faction ability) with two figures representing a team. Characters have 5 wounds, but their team shares promotional points, which are now tracked in units of 10 and through rank cards as the heroes increase in experience. Teams have secret secondary missions which may be at odds with the rest of the teams in the game and doomtrooper cards can give tactical advantages or be discarded to take an extra action.

As players take it in turns to play the Dark Legion they get to control the vast Citadel of Alakhai on Venus, its defences and the terrifying creatures ready to do battle with humankind. Each turn they will summon reinforcements, play event cards to further challenge the doomtroopers and try to defeat their friends with the forces of the Dark Legion. If the Dark Legion player does well at the role, his doomtrooper team gains promotion points to advance their characters rank for when they play the next mission!

85243,Loch Ness,2010,5.77232,324,1.5185,2,5,30,45,,Bluffing Deduction ,,"From the rules: For decades, reporters from around the world have been on the hunt for the Loch Ness monster.  But lately reports of sightings of Nessie have been increasing.

Such reports naturally have drawn such reporters as the attractive Belinda Viewing from New York, the half-Belgian Claude McMirror, the clever Filosa Sharp, as well as her Londoner competitor Jack Nesstee, and even Nils the Blitzen from Denmark to the Loch.  Equipped with the most modern equipment and techniques, these daring reporters have traveled to Scotland, in order to capture the elusive Nessie on film for their newspapers.

But the 5 will experience some surprises . . .

In Loch Ness, players compete to get pictures of Nessie.  In turn order, players place or move their photographers on the board as they try to anticipate the movement of the Loch Ness monster.  The movement of the monster is determined randomly by drawing move cards from the first three players, each card having a number from 1 to 5.  The cards are not revealed until after the photographers have been placed.  When they are revealed, the monster moves the total number of spaces and players score points based on the value of their photographers placed in the area where Nessie emerged.  In addition, the players whose photographers were directly in front of Nessie select photo cards that will award points at the end of the game, especially if sets are created.

Beginning in the second round, players will select an action space each round that gives them a unique power to use for for the round.  Placement also gets more challenging from the second round onward as a player is required to move a photographer, perhaps opening up spots for opponents.  Each round, some of the players do have a limited knowledge of how Nessie will move each round.  When a player draws a movement card before positioning his photographers, he is allowed to look at it, giving him one-third of the movement for that round.  However, movement varies tremendously and only three players draw movement cards each round.

The game ends after the round in which a mini Nessie figure reaches space 65 on the score track.  This figure moves the same number of spaces as the main Nessie figure in the game board each round.  The player with the most points, scored during the game and from the photo cards at the end, wins the game.  The rules include two optional variants that can be added individually or together with the base game.

Not to be confused with the 2010 Walter Obert game with the same theme, Loch Ness.

11179,Semper Victor,2004,7.38286,35,2.9,2,2,1200,1200,Wargames,Ancient Wargame ,Area Movement,"The second game in the series that includes Imperator and Ultimus Romanorum: La Chute de Rome, Semper Victor offers a grand strategic view of the Fourth Century Roman Empire. The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).

The map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.

The opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed Primus) represents the senior Emperor (Primus Augustus) and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player (Secundus, misspelled Secondus in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)

In the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.

The Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., Constance Chlore for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for Capacit de Commandement (number of units he can command), Capacit Politique (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), Valeur Stratgique (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and Bonus Tactique (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.

Very important to play are stratagems, which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.

Turns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs stratgiques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.

Movement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacit de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.

Players tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.

Players must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map. The rules are in French, though English translations are easy to find.

177014,Giga-Robo!,2017,8.93824,34,0,2,6,45,90,,Card Game Dice Fighting Miniatures Science Fiction ,Dice RollingGrid MovementHand ManagementModular BoardTake ThatVariable Player Powers,"Giga-Robo is the card-driven miniatures game of anime giant robot combat! Fight to the finish using custom-built hands of cards, combining powerful attacks, clever tactics, and epic finishing moves. Take command of one of four unique robots, pair it with your favorite pilot, and smash your opponents across a fully destructible city.

DEEP CUSTOMIZATION AND STRATEGY   
Choose from a powerful roster of pilots and robots, each with unique stats, styles, and alternative forms, to create a wide variety of play styles. Each Pilot and Robot has its own deck of Attack and Instant cards. Choose 15 of them to build your hand. Customize your robot by installing 3 abilities that can be used and triggered mid-game to turn the tide of battle. Select a new hand each game, or swap out your Pilot or Robot for a whole new set of possibilities, ensuring great replayability, personalization, and strategic variation.

DYNAMIC DICE AND CARD COMBAT
Roll fistfuls of dice against your opponent for over-the-top card-based attacks, powered by your Pilot's Fighting Spirit, and balanced by map position, strategic card play, and hand construction. You never draw cards from a deck, so the combos and combat cycles you design are always at your fingertips. Every time your opponent moves, plays a card, or resolves a dice roll, you can respond and counter with cards of your own. The battle is constant, dramatic, and engagingyou never have to wait for your turn to get in on the action.

COLLATERAL DAMAGE  
Every piece of terrain is fully destructible, revealing new hazards as you smash through the city. Use an exposed conduit from the city's power grid to charge your next attack. Throw your opponent through a skyscraper, leaving a blazing inferno in its wake. Strike the ground beneath your opponents feet, sending them crashing down into a massive crater. Combat is never staticyour attacks push, pull, and throw your opponent across the map and through every hazard you can find.

DOWN BUT NEVER OUT  
Every time your opponent inflicts damage to your robot, you gain resources based on your Pilots Rage and Power, giving way to stunning comeback moves and ever-shifting momentum.

THE COOLDOWN METER
Timing is essential; every time you play a card, it enters your Cooldown Meter and you wont be able to use it again for a set number of turns. Some cards have powerful buffs that Activate once theyre in Cooldown. The Cooldown Meter also controls how long youre hindered by the negative effects of Trauma Tokenscomponents that show the consequences of your opponent's most devastating attacks, and the effects of pushing your robot beyond its limits.

Each player controls a team of 3 cars. On your turn you assign a movement of 6 to one car, 5 to another and 4 to the third car (on your next turn you may assign the movement allowances differently if you wish).

To add a bit of racing flavor there is the option of slipstreaming (drafting). This is achieved by landing on a space marked with a chevron. If your car is directly behind another car then you may move an additional 3 spaces. If this takes you on to a space offering another slipstreaming opportunity (very rare!) then you may slipstream for a second time (but not a third).

To play, deal out twelve cards to each player; the deck consists of 78 cards: one 1, two 2s, and so on up to twelve 12s. By following the lead established by the first player, each player attempts to give away all of her cards before the other players can. The first player can lead a single card, a set of at least two cards of the same value, or a straight of at least two cards. The next players either pass or play a similar combination of cards (although not necessarily the same number of cards) that includes at least one card that's as low or lower than the lead player's low card. Whoever has played the lowest card once everyone has passed becomes the new lead player.

Whoever runs out of cards first claims one of the available gift cards; whoever has the most cards left in hand must give a gift card to this round's winner! Whoever has the most gifts when the gifts run out wins.

Each player takes control of the armed forces of either Norway, The Allies, or Germany. Using plastic soldier playing pieces that represent armies, and cards that represent war ships, bombers, fighters and special actions, the players battle for control of the six victory cities on the board. Managing the resources you get from your playing cards is crucial to succeed.

The starting point of the game and the resources available to the different factions are based on the historical conditions, but the players have the chance to change the course of history. Kampen om Norge is suitable for 23 players (or teams) and is playable in 23 hours.


Den 9. april 1940 overfaller tyske stridskrefter et nytralt og drlig forberedt Norge. Felttoget i Norge er hyt spill, men Hitler har bestemt seg for  legge landet under jernhlen. Norske og allierte styrker mobiliserer og nekter  gi seg uten kamp. Klarer de  stanse det tyske stormlpet?

Dette er utgangspunktet for strategispillet Kampen om Norge, et spennende brettspill om den tyske invasjonen i 1940, som gir spillerne mulighet til  utve historiekunnskap i praksis. Tidenes frste norske strategi-krigsspill er lekkert utfrt med naturtro brikker, realistiske spillekort og et detaljert kart.

Hver spiller ptar seg rollen som verstkommanderende for de militre styrkene til Norge, de allierte eller Tyskland. Ved hjelp av brikker, terninger og spillekort utkjemper spillerne en kamp seg imellom p brettet, der Norge og de allierte sammen m forske  stoppe Tysklands frammarsj p norsk jord og hindre at Tyskland okkuperer alle de viktige byene. Spillerne m ta strategiske valg, forvalte ressursene p spillekortene, flytte sine bataljoner omkring p spillebrettet og kjempe mot motstanderen om landomrdene. Den som velger den smarteste strategien, har best sjanse til  vinne, men det hjelper ogs  vre venn med terningene.

Kampen om Norge kan spilles i to vanskelighetsgrader.

At last, you can prove that you are worthy of being a member of the Heros council. Show them your skills by collecting the golden monster teeth. But be aware - the lands of Taora are not as peaceful as they seem. Rumor has it, that in the dark and gloomy Netherworld, some friends become enemies...

Now get up and hurry! The Heldentaufe already started. Be the first who returns the teeth of glory.

The unique experience of Heldentaufe arises due to two distinct but connected realms: The Upper world and the Netherworld. Heroes can travel back and forth to the separate worlds through so-called portals.

Events and activities taking place in the Upper world are mostly serene and peaceful. You will harvest natural goods, carry out missions and trade items that you find. Somewhere hidden in the Netherworld lies a bright and shiny treasure. But what underworld would be complete without monsters and traps?

Players will change perspective frequently since they not only have to tell their hero which move to make next, but also command the monsters in the Netherworld, as soon as an opponent enters the dark realm. In a game with three or four players, forging an alliance to increase a player's odds in combat against monsters can be a smart choice. However, players should choose their swordmates wisely - once unearthed, the treasures of the Netherworld might lead even their most trusted allies to suddenly turn against them...

Due to the two distinctly different worlds, both aggressive warmongers and pacifistic characters will embrace the gameplay of Heldentaufe.

Heldentaufe is easy to learn and lets you experience all the key elements of a true adventure role-playing game (discovering treasures, collecting items, completing missions, and battling monsters).

A game for tactical players who can count on their luck in critical situations.

The Gwynhyfarr, who roam the galaxy in faster-than-light starships, and the Pereen, who link their planets together in a trans-dimensional web which permits instantaneous movement from one system to another. Earth is weak and lies directly between its two opponents, but its society is vigorous and expanding. They can use technologies of both other races.

The game is unique as it is practically the only balanced three player wargame in existence. Other three player games usually quickly degenerate into two players ganging up on the third.

It is also one of the precious few interstellar wargames that use a reasonably accurate three-dimensional star map.

Employees are allowed to work only one minute because of very strong unions. Also due to the low budget, there aren't always wages for everyone, so not all of the staff wants to cooperate.

Paragraphs are read in sequence as determined by the rules and tables, describing new situations, locations and characters, providing clues and throwing red herrings in your path in your pursuit of the truth.

SHDSG is comprised of three booklets: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (comprised of Rules and Adventures), The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. You will need all three booklets and a few 6-sided dice (d6) to play the game. Future expansions will be available to supplement the rules, develop existing cases and solve new crimes.

You will read various numbered sections one after another but the sequence of paragraphs is determined by rules and tables. Each describes a new situation, or provides rules about the choices and actions you can make. There are plenty of events and situations, so each game will be a new, fresh experience. Ultimately it is also about your skill as a role player to piece the elements together.

SHDSG is an adventure game played in turns. A standard turn starts with you selecting an Action, such as Exploring, Planning or Investigating before. Generally in an Adventure, you will try to defeat a Villain. This is done by gaining Clue events to find out what has been happening and then reveal the Villain. Once you know the identity of the Villain you must try to discover their Motive and gain enough insight to Arrest them for their crimes!

However at this place is Ah Puch, the god of death and destruction. Ah Puch tries to disrupt construction as much as he can.

On a turn, you must place one of the identical pieces which twist in three dimensions. The object is to place blocks at the third level on two sides of the structure. Any part of a piece may never rise above the third level. This makes the game feel like you are assembling a giant 3D jigsaw puzzle. The 3rd player takes on the role of Ah Puch, the destructive god.

The Battlelines series of card games allow players to recreate the epic struggles of World War II. Each player uses a deck of cards to represent the troops of an historical formation about the size of a division. A third deck, the Operation deck, is used to create a series of battles using Mission and Location cards. Points are scored for achieving Mission objectives and destroying enemy troops. A typical 100 point Operation can be played in about an hour.  The game can also be played by teams of up to three players on each side.

This, the first  in the Battlelines Series World War II card games. It includes Units and Operations from the German 1942 offensive against Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-attack (Operation Uranus) which trapped the German 6th Army in the city, and the gallant efforts of 4th Panzer Army to relieve their surrounded comrades (Operation Winter Storm).

Unit Decks represent divisional level assets. They are the basic play decks. One is needed for each player. Operation Decks are used to generate a random series of scenarios depicting several days of fighting. Higher Echelon Decks will allow players to introduce new cards into their Unit Decks to liven up the game and surprise their opponents with new stratagems.

The decks are not collectible per se.  There are no rare cards to collect.  They can however be customized by mixing in units from higher echelon decks that are available.  The game is considered expandable since there are many different decks (sold individually) that can be played against each other.

Can you out them publicly, while staying unknown yourself and bagging a nice collection of gems?

In Suspicion, ten characters start on the perimeter of the game board, and each player is secretly one of these characters. On a turn, you roll two dice, then move the two characters shown (or characters of your choice if you roll a joker). After this, you play one of the two action cards in your hand, and carry out one of the actions on that card: stealing a type of gem in the space where your character is located, moving any character, asking someone else whether their character can be seen by someone on the board, and so on.

Gems come in three types, and when one of the piles is empty, the game ends. Everyone guesses who is which character, then all identities are revealed. For each player you've guessed correctly, you score 7 points; for each set of three different gems, you score 6 points; and for each individual gem aside from the sets, you score 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins!

Apparently they were common on the Continent and are still used in places where lift doors would be unsafe, such as nuclear power stations. Anyway, this game has 9 thick cards showing various odd looking passengers going up or down in the lift, with some only partially shown. Each player has a deck of cards showing the same people, in different poses. The cabin cards are shuffled and laid out face-down in two columns of 5, with a gap and a pawn is placed next to the gap. First player to grab the die rolls it and moves the pawn clockwise to face a cabin. Players call out which person they think is in the cabin and the cabin card is turned up. If you're correct, you dump the matching card from your hand; if not, you keep it. But the cabin card is replaced face-down in the original empty space, not where it was previously. In this way, the cabin cards will be moved around as you play, and you'll have to use your memory to clear your hand to win.
There are also tempo chips you can draw for correctly guessing a card you've already dumped. You can use the chips to move the pawn fore or back from the numbered rolled (so it goes to a cabin you remember and want to dump). But get it wrong and you pick the card back to your hand.
A surprisingly hard memory game but still lots of fun. Published as Comings  Goings in the UK and Vanished in the US, it is now in print as Think: Paternoster by Ravensburger, with the player's cards being simply objects held by the people, like a Handy (that's German for mobile phone).

9509,Iglu Iglu,2004,5.98596,114,2,2,4,60,60,,,Action Point Allowance SystemArea Control / Area InfluenceModular BoardTile Placement,"At first the board is a field of ice with four squares in the middle cracked open to reveal a few fish.  You start your turn by picking up one more square of ice next to some water already open; this square will turn out to have more fish, or a polar bear, or to be hard ice instead of water and have a fox on it -- or instead it may confer a special power such as melting an extra square of ice or pushing a row of ice squares one space.  Meanwhile the players' Inuit meeples approach from the edge of the board to hunt the fish and the other animals to score points and to build igloos for territorial reasons.  The game ends when there's no more ice to be melted (all the squares next to open water have an Inuk or an igloo on them), prompting a final scoring based on which players have control of the remaining islands.

Even in the gamers' version (Inuit cannot enter a square with an opposing igloo, scoring is a little different at the end) noted by the authors, the tiles you draw determine, to a large extent, your luck in the game.  But your cleverness in scrambling to make the best of opportunities keeps Iglu Iglu interesting.

Each round lasts four turns, and on each turn players simultaneously reveal a pair of cards from their hand. Cards with the same numeral and same numeral color (twins) outrank cards of the same numeral but different numeral colors (pairs), which outrank two cards of the same suit (colors), which outrank anything else; sums of values act as a tiebreaker.

On the first turn, some number of players with the lowest-ranked cards pay two money to the kitty in the middle of the table; on the second turn, some number of players with the highest ranks each take three money; on the third turn, some number of players with the lowest-ranked cards pay one money to the kitty and drop from the round; and on the fourth turn, the player with the highest-ranked cards takes the kitty. The number of players who pay or win money varies depending on the number of players. Rounds continue until someone runs out of money, then the player with the most money wins.

This feature alone gives players the opportunity to build massive fleets without breaking the bank.

Wormhole promises cinematic space combat with visual style and presentation not yet seen in the genre. Rules are easy to understand but offer a scaling level of depth for a variety of play styles. Wormhole also introduces an interactive damage and orders system which removes heavy book-keeping tasks and replaces it with a control panel-like interface (you feel absolutely in control, barking orders to your fleet). A number of unique gaming elements conspire to make Wormhole a truly immersive and completely original gaming experience.

With each turn, you defeat monsters, disarm traps, and open doors as you explore a dark dungeon. Along the way you collect treasure, gain skills, even use magic. But death awaits those who linger too long, and if all your torches burn out you will be lost in the dungeon forever. The objective is to find
the tomb hoards of four ancient kings, collect as much additional treasure as possible, and make it out alive.

The spread is the standard layout for the game. At the top of the spread is an area where you play torches (A), as they appear. In the middle of the spread is the dungeon area itself. Turns descending into the dungeon are played in a row from left to right. This row is called the delve. The turns ascending from the depths of the dungeon are played underneath the delve from right to left, with one turn for each turn of the delve except the turn-around point. This is called the retreat. Below the dungeon area, from left to right are a discard area, a hit point counter, and a hand where you collect your treasure, tomb hoards, skill cards, and magic scroll.

The game is divided into turns. Each turn, you play a series of cards in the dungeon area. The turn represents an encounter as you explore the vast and sprawling dungeon. Layer the cards in a column while the turn is active. When the turn is over, stack those cards face down before moving on to the next turn. Each turn starts by playing cards from the deck until an encounter card appears.

If you make it out of the dungeon alive, add up all the treasure in your hand.  If you found all four kings and survived, you have won the game, regardless of points. Multiply total points by 100 to calculate the value of your treasure in gold pieces.

Recently, you find yourself in the back room of Rasmuson's Bookshop in the heart of Easley by the River. There, on shelves heavy with dust, you find a leather bound volume and from between its pages a letter drops. Its author describes a fabled ancient brass clock and navigation device, the Antikythera, whose 6 parts were disassembled and hidden in the city of Val Justinia to prevent it from falling into the hands of a shadowy cabal operating within the S.C.E's very halls. The letter goes on to say that if the cabal and its allies, the Federation of Air Pirates, were to discover this device, they could wreak untold havoc, potentially circumnavigate the globe and attack Arkadys eastern border.

It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.

The System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (ST #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.
Units represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.

All units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.

Politics are a factor in the game. Each side has a National Will Index which gives the current level of popular support. This is affected by combat outcomes and other game events. (Specific Rules) Each turn, players have the opportunity to draw Political Events markers, representing various factors affecting the outcome of the conflict.

In this sport and in the Ultimate boardgame, two teams of 7 athletes compete to launch and receive the disc in the opponent's end zone, scoring 1 point.
In the boardgame, the team who first scores 3 points wins.
Or, players may agree to the best score after 15 or 30 minutes.

The game board is a hexed field.
The team in possession of the disc may: 
-MOVE one athlete
OR
-LAUNCH the disk

When an athlete receives the disc, he must stop in place but his teammates may still run in any direction and receive the disc. 
In doing so, the team attempts to receive the disc inside the opponent's end zone.

Before launching, the player must declare the pattern of the disc that, on the hexed field, may be along a straight line or along a two segments line forming an angle of 120 degrees. 
On the rulesheet see examples of patterns.

The team on defense can move one athlete per turn trying to: 
-make pressure on the disk handler, by moving a defender close to him
-place athletes near each possible receiver to improve possibilities to deflect or intercept the disc.  
If this happens, the defense can immediately take the disc and start from that point, in opposite direction.

Defenders may intercept if they are close to launcher or receiver and if the disk patterns is over or adjacent to them.

All athletes have different bonuses in launching, receiving and defending.

3471,Le Mans,1961,6.3587,69,2.2,1,12,60,60,,Racing Sports ,Dice RollingVariable Player Powers,"The great-grandfather of today's racing games, elements of Le Mans are clearly evident in games like Formula D.  Le Mans offers the choice of twelve different car specifications that detail the number of spaces the car travels in each gear and which gears the cars can safely negotiate turns.  Also, the different car types have different braking characteristics.

The game includes two tracks printed on the same board, Monte Carlo and Le Mans.  Each track is only two lanes wide, and the spaces on the track are only a half-car-length, so a car takes up two spaces at once.

The cars move in order of track position. Each turn, a car may either remain in the same gear, shift up one gear, or shift down according to the car's specifications.  It must then move the exact number of spaces required by the particular model of car in the specified gear.

When cornering, if a car exceeds the gear specified for the particular model of car, it must take a chance.  The driver must roll the die to determine if the car safely cornered, spun out, crashed, or damaged the car such that a pit stop is required.  If a car spins out, a wet track marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.

If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.  Collisions require that the involved cars make a pit stop for repairs.

Optional rules include guidelines for slipstreaming, over-revving to move an extra space, and details of team, solo, and timed play, and Le Mans-style starts.

The game is a revised version of Wright-Mudge Enterprises' Grand Prix: A Sports Car Racing Game.

Sake flows freely, but not even the cellars of Bishamon, the God of War, could quench the thirst of Japan's greatest swordsmen. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Will it be the elder of the group, or shall the greatest warrior have it? Time seems to stretch to infinity, until one hand makes a move toward the cup. Such insolence! This insult shall not be tolerated! The elder goes for his sword...

We shall never know whether the bold samurai was taking the cup for himself or only to hand it to his venerable companion. It does not matter: all warriors take offense and draw their katanas, joining the fight at the call of SAAKEEE!

In Sake  Samurai you are a fierce and thirsty samurai warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of Sake. The winner is the most drunk samurai  in game terms, the player who has collected the most Sake drink counters  at the end of the Sudden Death round.

Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the sword. Each drink of Sake prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the Sake you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much Sake, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the Masu is empty and the Sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Enma, the thirsty god of death, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their Sake. Raise your glasses (and your katanas)!

41247,Mia,600,6.23467,75,1.2222,2,12,20,20,,Bluffing Dice ,Betting/WageringDice Rolling,"Mia is an ancient bluffing dice game using two dice and a cup to conceal the dice.  It is believed to have been played by the Vikings.  There are affinities with Liar's Dice (and the card game Bullshit), but also some interesting differences.

Players take turns rolling the dice beneath a cup and announcing a higher roll than the previous roll.  This announcement can be challenged, with the roller losing a life if caught lying, and the challenger losing a life if the roller was truthful (players typically start with three lives).  There is also the option (instead of rolling the dice oneself or challenging the previous roller) of  passing your turn (without viewing the roll under the cup) to the next player.  In this case the passer assumes responsibility for the roll as if he or she had rolled it him- or herself.  (Thus, if the next player challenges the announced value, it is the passer who stands to lose a life if the value under the cup is not that which was announced.)

One interesting feature of Mia is the non-standard ordering of rolls. 21 is Mia, the highest roll.  Next come the doubles in ascending order: 11 is the second best roll, then 22, 33, 44, 55, 66.  From there the numbers descend, with the higher die always naming the tens value and the lower die naming the ones value:  65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 54, 53, 52, 51, 43, 42, 41, 32, and 31 as the lowest value.

His proposal to Korea (Joseon Dynasty) to march through their territory was denied, and there began The Imjin War.

In Far East War 1592, players are divided into Japan and China/Korea factions, with each side trying to conquer the target provinces of their rivals. Players alternate to move around the action roundel to perform different actions such as recruit forces, assign generals, march armies, initiate battles, etc. With careful planning on the action roundel, tactical movement and assignment of troops and generals, and a bit luck in dice roll during battles, players should revive the vivid history in the Far East War.

在1592這一年，權傾一時的豐臣秀吉野心漫出日本本島，向朝鮮提出「假道入明」的狂妄要求。20萬大軍計畫穿過朝鮮半島，攻打明朝，征服整個東亞。這場亞洲版三國志，從海上打到陸地，僵持了超過6年，史稱壬辰倭亂、文祿/慶長之役、萬曆朝鮮之役，但最為人知的稱呼為：「壬辰之戰」。
 日軍進攻初期，勢如破竹；朝鮮王節節敗退，王京漢城、陪都平壤相繼失守，被逼至鴨綠江畔，求請明朝救援。中日韓三國於是在朝鮮半島，展開激烈駁火。
玩家一分扮演日本，另一方扮演明朝與朝鮮，善用手中的武將，調度場上的部隊，精算備用的糧餉，還要預防未知事件對軍情帶來的影響。誰能攻下戰役中的目標，就能成為「壬辰之戰」中的最後勝利者。

42591,Summer Lightning: The Invasion of Poland 1939,2011,6.905,40,2.8571,1,2,240,240,Wargames,Wargame World War II ,Chit-Pull SystemHex-and-Counter,"Designed by veteran designer Brian Train, Summer Lightning is an operational simulation of the invasion of Poland by German, Slovakian and Soviet forces in September-October 1939. The campaign was a brief, bloody, and confusing affair fought between two armies which were considered equals by many in the world.

Despite the interesting campaign, there arent many war games on the Polish campaign, probably because the conventional wisdom is that it was a very unbalanced contest. This is informed mostly by hindsight. The German Army knew it had superior numbers and organization, but much of its equipment was no better than that fielded by the Poles, the concept of blitzkrieg had not been proven in actual combat, and they were not at all sure that the campaign would not bog down into static fighting. As it was the Germans lost over 16,000 dead in five weeks of campaigning.

Summer Lightning uses a proven game system that features an interactive sequence of play and near-diceless combat that both shows the historical German superiority in command and control and is flexible enough to allow players to explore many variations and options, so that the game can be as equal (or unequal) a contest as they want. Options include: variable Polish deployments; greater or lesser surprise and speed of mobilization; changed attitudes of the Soviet Union or neighbouring countries; French intervention; Plan Zachod (the Romanian Bridgehead Strategy); and even the possibility that the Blitzkrieg, so appealing in theory, fizzles out on the battlefield. Also, because so many war games are designed for two but played by one, an optional solitaire play method is included.

7861,Soldier Emperor,2003,6.08932,103,2.7826,2,7,240,240,Wargames,Napoleonic Territory Building Wargame ,Campaign / Battle Card DrivenPoint to Point Movement,"From the publisher's web page:

Taking Soldier Kings as its base, Soldier emperor covers the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, 1803-1815. There are 180 huge and thick playing pieces like those in Granada, 165 smaller marker pieces, two large hard-mounted game boards like that in Granada, and 64 cards.

The map stretches from Britain to Persia, North Africa to Norway. Europe is divided into areas, each of them rated for their resources, manpower potential, and defense value. Armies move along the routes that connect these areas, and the object of the game is to conquer and hold as much territory as you can. Soldier Emperor is very true to history but is easily playable by anyone with an interest in games or history.

This is probably the first time that Persia has appeared in a Napoleonic wargame, but the Persians fought the Russians twice in this period and also threatened war with the Turks. They receive two armies, plus their fine leader, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza.

Turkey's eastern border regions are shown as well: Kurdistan and Baghdad appear. Unlike other games, the Turkish player can't operate with a secure right flank but must worry about his or her back door. The Turks begin with rather mediocre leadership, Ebubekir and Bayrakdar on land and Seyit Ali on the sea. But once Sultan Selim is overthrown (an event brought about by card play), Turkish leadership improves as junior generals are promoted. The Turks also can deploy the Banner of the Prophet, using Mohammed's ancient flag to inspire their troops.

Austria has a large army, one good general for most of the game (Archduke Charles) and a slim chance to receive an excellent one (Radetzky) and another good one (Frimont) late in the game. The rest of the Austrian generalship is not so good, and the empire is surrounded by potential enemies.

Prussia is small and relatively weak, but does have two fair generals (Yorck and Blcher) and a good army. But if the army is lost in action Prussia's low resources and manpower will make the losses difficult to replace.

France of course has Napoleon, some other very good generals, and the largest army in the game. The French player also has the Imperial Guard. France has a powerful economy and strong starting position  and a large target painted right on the French player's back. France's revolutionary ways bring its player a number of game advantages (in movement and battle) and some disadvantages as well (in diplomacy, at least until France's enemies have been beaten into submission).

Britain has the expected advantages: large income from overseas trade, a powerful fleet, and Lord Nelson. They also have a couple of lesser admirals (Collingwood and Jervis) and the outstanding Duke of Wellington to lead the land forces. But the army is small, and hard to replace if lost.

Spain can call out guerrillas if invaded, and will need every advantage to offset its weak economy, poor generalship and second-rate army. The fleet is good, and Gravina is a good admiral. Spain also has access to several minor countries that others can't easily reach, and a starting position in Italy that can allow for quick expansion (Etruria, held by a Spanish prince in 1803).

Russia, the final player-controlled country, has a vast land area, a strong position on the edge of the board, and a large and strong army. Leadership is good, with Kutusov and Kamensky the best of the lot plus Senyavin to command the fleet. But as in Soldier Kings, the Russian player will be chronically short of cash and willing to do many things to change this.

As in Soldier Kings, the game can be played with fewer than seven players, all the way down to two. Card play drives the action, with players able to play cards at any time and thwart their opponents' plans. Play order is determined by each country's initiative, and generals and admirals move their forces from area to area. And like Soldier Kings, combat is simple to resolve but contains many wrinkles of strategy.

If you liked Soldier Kings, you'll adore Soldier Emperor. Play is fast and furious, strategies are many, and the excitement level is high. A game lasts about four hours, with the campaign game taking somewhat longer.

In order to facilitate this process, players will use their Geld (money) to hire Dragon Lairds (aristocrats) and buy Resources (buildings) and Commoners (peasants).  You can use precious Royals (your victory points) to acquire Dragon Havocs, which empower you to do anything from getting extra cash, to stealing things from your opponents.  The Havocs tend to be one-shot little guys, however, and are always discarded to the bottom of the discard deck, as far out of reach as possible from those cards that pilfer the discard pile.

At the end of each round, you accumulate the Geld and Royals that your acquisitions generate for your clan.  At the end of the game, you additionally receive any Finale Royals on cards as end-game victory points.

From the Margaret Weis web site: 
Deep in the heart of an island continent, many years ago, was a long forgotten land of ancient Saureans Dragons of all sizes and shapes, who had, through the generations tamed the foolish races of men, dwarves, and elves that lived among them. Over the centuries, they refined their techniques and now were trying to gain control over all the surrounding dragon countries. There could be only one Dragon Monarch, but who would it be?

At the start of the game, each player is given a dragon clan and chooses to play either the king or queen of that clan.  The object is for your clan to score the most points in Royals by the end of the game and thus become the ruling Dragon Monarch.

His job is to move from point to point around the map of London by taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives  that is, the remaining players acting in concert  move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X and capture him. The tricky part is that while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is known only intermittently throughout the game.

Scotland Yard Master includes six additional game elements, four of which are part of a free app for iOS and Android that offers detectives limited tools to locate Mr. X. For example, the detectives can use radio towers to get a rough sense of where Mr. X is located, with the color of the radio waves hinting at whether he's close to each tower. The two-dimensional game board can also be converted to a 3D view, and the detectives can ask witnesses on the buildings whether they've recently seen Mr. X. The app also allows for pass-and-play, with Mr. X having a self-generated PIN so that the detectives can't accidentally discover his location.

Scotland Yard Master also has new action options for Mr. X: Helicopter and Sabotage.

The goal of the game is to build the most successful waste processing company, that will bring the highest income and the most victory points.

The players incorporate the roles of waste processing managers who will build recycling and incineration plants, as well as waste processing facilities in order to transform unwanted waste into profitable business.

The game lasts ten rounds, each divided into four phases. In the first littering phase players draw four waste cards each from the draw pile and choose exactly one of them to keep. Later on comes the investment phase in which players may purchase recycling and incineration plants as well as the waste processing facility and profitability tokens, that will be placed at the players boards. All those investments influence the recycling and incineration phase, which provides players with waste cards, that will be processed in the last phase in order to bring revenue.

After the last, 10th round the game finishes and the time comes for assessment of the players efforts. Victory points are awarded for proper investments and gained money. The players may also be punished with negative points for garbage cards and waste cards that they discarded during the game. After summing up the victory and negative points, the winner is determined.

Waste processing has never been this much fun!

It plays 2, 3 or 4 players, in team or free for all.
It's easy to learn, fast paced, fun, and as the title suggests, brutal.

Each player is rapresented by a bloodthirsty Brute.
These characters, like any other warrior worth of his name, can be equiped with different kinds of weapon, shiels, armours and special objects that can be used during the fight. The choice of the equipment and the Brute unique special power determine how many cards the player can bring to the fight.

The cards let you attack the player or perform special actions, the objective of the game is to defeat your opponent's Brute.
A succesfully landed attack (not prevented with special cards, armours or shields) forces the target to discard cards from his hands, if he has no more cards to discard he has to draw a card from the damage deck. 
A damage card is often a bad thing (a wound a mutilation, or even a sudden death) but can give bonuses sometimes, like going berserk.

Vessels from the Baltic Sea carried lumber, wool, iron, and hemp while vessels from the Black Sea delivered silk and spices from the Far East.  At the center of it all was the port city of Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, where merchant families earned fortunes from the trade.

84864,Insidious Sevens,2010,6.53333,63,1.7778,2,5,30,30,,Card Game ,Trick-taking,"Insidious Sevens is a trick-taking game in which players predict how many tricks they will win each round. The deck consists of 40 cards, numbered 0-7 in five colors, with the colors ranked on the cards: purple (high), blue, green, yellow, red (low). Note that all 7s are higher than any 6, which are each higher than any 5, and so on.

At the start of a round, each player is dealt seven cards. Players pass 0-3 cards to their left or right neighbor depending on the round number. Players then predict the number of tricks they'll take by choosing a card in their hand and simultaneously revealing them. The player with the highest bid becomes start player for the round, and the color of that player's card indicates the trump suit for that round. These bidding cards are then returned to the players' hands.

The start player for a trick lays down a card, and each player must follow the lead by playing a card of the same color or number. If this isn't possible, they can play any card. The highest trump card played (if any) wins the trick; otherwise the highest card played that followed the lead (including number!) wins the trick. After seven tricks, the round ends. Making one's bid nets two points plus the number of tricks bid, while missing results in a loss of one point for every under- or over-trick. The player with the highest score after seven rounds wins.

An optional rule forbids the bids from summing to seven. If this occurs, the player with the highest bid scores one point, then the bid cards are set aside and players rebid from the cards remaining in hand. This process can repeat until the total of bids made does not equal seven.

On each player's turn they can move and possibly eat grass, recon (peek to see what's under some grass), camouflage a sheep, use an action card or shift the wolf.

Each clump of grass eaten is worth 1,3, or 5 points.  1 point grass lets you pick up an action card for use in a later turn , 5 point grass is so good your sheep must spend the rest of the game digesting it and 3 point grass is, well it's just 3 point grass.  But beware!  Under each clump of grass a wolf may be lurking, if you try to eat grass over a wolf he will eat your sheep!

With two players, one player uses two cop pieces, and the other uses two robber pieces. With more players, the pieces are divided as required, but there must be an equal number of cops to robbers - thus with odd numbers of players, one player should play two pieces.

The object for the robbers is to steal objects and get them safely to their hideout - for the cops it is to catch a robber red-handed, and recover the goods. When all ten goods are either stolen (and hidden away) or recovered by the police, the winner is the player who has stolen/recovered the most.

A fairly straightforward roll and move game, but the pieces and quality of build makes this a better than normal game of this type. Nice molded and painted player pieces depict robbers with swag bag over their shoulder (into which can actually be placed the item being stolen), and the traditional British Bobbie with his truncheon.

Dwar7s Fall is a game about collecting gems in order to trade it for food. In the meantime you also will need to build your dwarf kingdom and slay some monsters. In this game you have multiple paths to win by choosing carefully your actions.

Players take turns to perform their actions. Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile or place one dwarf in a tile or move one dwarf by one tile).

Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool.

When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not played this round make their last turn and, then, the game ends. The points are calculated and wins the match who has more points.

Tarleton's Quarter! highlights some salient aspects of the British campaign in the south. First and foremost was the effect of leadership, and the difficulty both sides had in finding leaders who were bold without being rash. Rarely did energy and sound judgment come in the same package. Another vital factor was the terrain of the southern colonies, or rather, one feature of it: water. The reason that water  in the form of rivers and swamps  is the dominant terrain feature is  surprise!  it rained a lot, particularly in the Carolinas. These facts on the ground raise the amount of non-combat losses, like those caused by disease, which made just keeping an army intact such a headache at the time. (There's nothing romantic about losing large numbers of men to something beyond a player's control.) As to why so many people lived in North and South Carolinas' pestilential swamps, it was because those swampy areas were precisely where rice and indigo grew best, and in the 18th century in the Carolinas, that was where the money was; cotton was a much later development.

Perhaps the most important factor of all was the continuing British belief in an untapped reservoir of loyalist support in the south. Those in command of the British army knew they didn't have enough manpower to control even the southern half of the American colonies on their own. They were relying on the appearance of a silent majority of loyal, but previously suppressed, American subjects who would take control of those provinces swept of Continental forces. Appropriately, you are allowed to indulge in as much over-confidence as your red coat will allow.

11030,Sher-co Baseball,1968,7.05263,38,2,1,2,60,60,,Sports ,Dice Rolling,"SherCo's GrandSlam Baseball Game is back in a new graphically-enhanced print and pdf downloadable format.

First brought to market in 1968 (as SherCo II Baseball Simulation, and the most fun to play!), the game has been brought back to market by its inventor, Dr. Steve LeShay, and is under license with Hot Stove Games.   It is being distributed by ASGgames.

SherCo was the first of its kind to be played on a game board representing a composite stadium with a 28 x 28 numbered square grid. It also was the first to rate every player who played in at least one game in a season; and it was the first to provide its unique rating formulae so that customers could rate their own players and teams.

Each player is rated for batting average, home runs, triples, clutch-hitting, walks, strike outs, hit by pitch, base stealing speed, throwing arm, and fielding range and average; and each pitcher is rated for his ERA, innings of effectiveness, number of complete games, K/BB ratio, and home runs allowed.

The game still has all of these unique features (including a wind factor; automatic umpire; artificial turf rules; injury, hit and run, special and freak events, and error charts; and playing pieces representing the ball, fielders, batter, and base runners so that you can position players where you want them to play and watch every play unfold right before your eyes. There are also Fast Action Charts included with each season to get one-roll accurate results for games between other teams as you complete a season for your favorite team.

Each dice-activated result allows a patented stop-action effect to visually occur when a probable hit or probable out batted ball is plotted on a specific square on the stadium's playing field.  As the runners advance, the fielder moves to the ball, fields it and throws to where you want the ball to go in a quick, seamless sequence of turns.  A ball may drop in for a hit or become an out depending on where it is hit, the strength and direction of the wind, and where a defensive player is positioned. Depending on where you are playing, a long fly ball may be caught or go over the fence for a home run, or ricochet off the wall for a double or possible triple.

A solitaire or head-to-head game takes only 30-45 minutes to play, depending on the score. SherCo has also re-released its rules supplement for setting up SherCo Leagues of Baseball Simulation (a/k/a SLOBS) for short-season (e.g., 24-game) leagues that you can play with family and/or friends.  Additionally, SherCo will be offering another set of rules for Olde Tyme Base-ball for those interested in playing 1870-1920 seasons.

All 30 modern day ball parks have been beautifully redone to include new features such as the fountains at Kauffman Stadium, McCovey Cove at AT, Fenway's Green Monster, the fans swimming pool at Chase Field, and even the Big Apple Home Run display at Citi Field. The new SherCo game includes stadium layouts for each major league ballpark and the most recently-completed big league season (which is available every January 1).  There are many specialty sets of the vintage old-time teams, famous world championship series, greatest also-rans, and others available for the game.   Fourteen complete season sets, including 2015, are also available with more on the way.

On his turn, a player places Beppo on a powerful magnet, then sends a small metallic ball in its direction. If he meets them, Beppo will kick the players' figures away (sending them back to the start of the track), and the place where he arrives on the board determines how far the active player moves his pawn.

128927,Shinobi: War of Clans,2012,5.94624,133,1.4,3,5,20,20,,Card Game Medieval Spies/Secret Agents ,Hand Management,"At the turn of the 16th century in Japan both the Emperor and the tycoon lost control of the country  the time when pushy and ambitious daimyos to subdue islands, the time for strong warriors to demonstrate their boldness and great warlords to show their art, the time when cunning secret agents decided a battle of the clans.

In the tactical card game Shinobi: War of Clans players will take on the role of secret agents of the most powerful clans of feudal Japan. The aim of the game is supporting your clan with military advantage; the clan which has the most troops at the end of the game wins.

At the beginning of the game each player gets a clan card which shows what clan the player will belong to and four troop cards from the deck. The area before the player (his table) presents one of Japans provinces, so the more players the more provinces. The players take turns clockwise from the starting player. Each players turn consists of the following orders: the troop deployment order, the troop movement order and the attacking order. During his turn the player must place a card from his hand on any province except his own one. If by the end of his turn in his province he raised the army (some troops of the same clan) which is stronger (more numerous) than any other army in any other province, the battle is unavoidable. It will be impossible to stop the warlike samurais from attacking but there is an opportunity to direct them to the proper side.  Once there are no more cards in the deck players take a final turn and come in true colors (reveal their secret cards). Clan cards are summed up and the player with the most cards of his clan in all the provinces wins the game.

Whats feudal Japan without ninjas! Without them no game about Japan can be complete. The ninjas function is obvious  to shorten the number of warriors from the enemy clans.

From 3 to 5 players can take part in the game. The tactics of the game changes depending on the number of players. You will need careful calculation to win in a five-player game; fans of bluff and psychological game will like the game with three participants. The game seems simple at first sight, but believe or not, keeping your clan in secret, guessing which clans your rivals play for and making them to play into your hands is not simple at all.

By separate invitation, you and a select few others have been invited to Watersdown Mansion as the weekend guests of Sir Roger Watersdown. As Sir Roger's guest, I thought you might be interested in some information about the mansion and, perhaps, about the other guests that will be present during your stay. I have enclosed a brief biography of each guest. Watersdown Mansion is an old, elegant stone building situated in Yorkshire, England, and constructed in 1817. The original owner, Lord Balmy Farfrummit, made his fortune selling English pig iron to the French after Bonaparte's defeat in 1815. Roger Watersdown acquired the entire Farfrummit holdings in 1925 after the tragic death of Viscount Farfrummit aboard his sailing yacht, Frummit's Ferry, which foundered during a fierce storm off Falmouth Harbor. Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host. Female guests are cautioned that Sir Roger, after consumption of his customary evening cocktails, tends to become something of a leech. I welcome you on behalf of Sir Roger and the entire Watersdown Mansion household, and I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.

At the start of the game, the 32 dinosaur cards (four cards each of eight different dinosaurs) are shuffled with one start excavations card and 15 randomly-chosen action cards from a total of 22. A player shuffles these cards, lays them out in a 6x8 rectangle, then removes the start excavations card to show where the dig begins.

On a turn, a player reveals any card that has at least one edge adjacent to the digging area. Dinosaur and action cards have different backs, so the player knows what type of card he draws, but not which card exactly. If she draws a dinosaur card, she places it face-up in front of her. If she draws an action card, she may be able to take a second turn, steal from another player, or force an exchange of one bone for another; she may also be forced to discard a card, or she might end up with a rock, which is placed back in the dig area for everyone to work around. When a player has four cards of the same dinosaur, she groups them as a set; these cards cannot be lost or stolen.

The game ends when the final dinosaur card is collected. Players score 1, 3, 6 or 10 points for a set of 1-4 dinosaur cards of the same type, and the player with the most points wins.

The 74th Division of the Chinese 57th Army (nicknamed as Growling Tiger Division) was ordered to defend Changde and fate will decide the outcome of the battle.

The Battle of Changde began on 18th November 1943 when the Imperial Japanese 11th Army under the command of Isamu Yokoyama already approached the strongholds in the suburbs of Changde with around 20,000 men under three divisions. The Japanese 116th Division in the northwest began to attack the Chinese defenders at Huangtu Mountain and the Hefu Mountain while the Japanese 68th Division in the east began to attack Shigongmiao and Xinmin Bridge (XinminQiao). The Japanese 3rd Division in the south advanced towards the southern bank of Yuan River after they took Deshan. On 25th November 1943 these three Japanese Divisions were outside Changde City.

The Chinese garrisons in the fortifications inside the city near the eastern, northern and western gates engaged the Japanese Forces continuously without any rest with the Japanese having firepower supremacy in both air force bombardments and artillery fires. On 28th November 1943, Japanese General Yokoyama launched simultaneous attacks on all the four gates. Despite the Chinese 57th Division fought valiantly, the city wall had fallen.

At the same time, reinforcements from the Chinese 19th Division were advancing towards Hefu and the 190th Division had begun to counterattack from the east. At this very moment, the overall commander of the defending garrison at Changde, Division Commander Yu Ching Man issued his last telegraph to Sun Lianzhong in this battle. No more ammunition, without reinforcement, the city has fallen.

Sun was the deputy commander of the Sixth Front On 1st December 1943, reinforcements from the Chinese 10th Army have captured positions at Deshan and the Chinese 3rd Division and the 10th Division were approaching from the southern bank to help the Changde garrison though they were unable to contact with the 57th Division, thereby failing to make concerted attack. On 3rd December 1943, the Chinese Regiment Commander Chai Yee Sun died gloriously while leading the last Chinese combat unit when covering the retreat of General Yu Ching Man and the remnants of the 57th division. On 6th December, the Japanese found themselves attacked by seven corps from the Chinese Sixth Front and the Ninth Front and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw to prevent the annihilation of the Japanese 11th Army.

On 7th December, General Yu Ching Man led the remnants of the 57th Division and coordinated with the 11th Division to attack Changde. On 9th Division, the Chinese entered the city through the Eastern gate and recovered Changde City. The Japanese withdrew back to the original frontline in early January 1944. In this battle, less than 300 of the original 8,000 defenders survived and the Japanese lost more than 4,000 soldiers in the sieget with total casualties of the campaign around 10,000. Chinese casualties were more than 100,000 but they held the City of Changde at a terrible price.

Scale
1hex = 800m , unit = bataillon. Compared to the original game, we reworked the supply rules system and the management of the tactical chits and Air Force chits (and new graphics..)

Victory conditions
The Japanese must control Changde at the end of the game. If at the end of any turn the Japanese control Changde, it's an automatic victory. If at any time during the game a Chinese reinforcement unit enters Changde, the Chinese wins the game. The Japanese will start strong but will have a lot to do to keep their supply roads safe. Supply is needed for heavy artillery and to reorganize and reconstruct infantry units. The Chinese reinforcement will enter the map in their rear from all sides. A double encirclement. It will be brutal.

Activation by divisions. Tactical chits and Air Force chits. Classical sequence of play and CRT. But as always with Wayne's games, there's more than that.

198003,Dark Deeds,2016,8.2037,54,1,2,5,0,60,,Card Game ,Card DraftingHand Management,"Dark Deeds is a darkly humorous card game of skullduggery and suspicion for 2 to 5 players. In Dark Deeds players take the role of minions in service to a powerful, mysterious, and clearly villainous, patron. The Patron wants deeds of infamy, violence and coercion committed and you are the ones who must avoid the authorities, the do-gooders and, most of all, each other to perform them. Rich rewards beckon, along with horrific punishments for failure. So are you the kind of malevolent minion the patron needs?

Theres a street deck for the minions prospective targets  clerics, artisans, and merchants and their protective guards from the city watch. Then theres a tavern deck with potentially useful loot and plot cards to help the minions get the job done. The implacable hand of evil is revealed by the nemesis cards in the street deck  princes, politicians, and do-gooders the players evil patron wants eliminated. The tavern deck includes Dark Deeds, specific missions to take out particular nemeses (thats the plural of nemesis in case youre wondering). Picking up a Dark Deed is a very mixed blessing. A rich reward is earned for completing it, but it cant be discarded and the patron will exact a heavy price for any incomplete Dark Deeds held at the end of the game.

The masterful touch is how the street deck is laid out to create a constantly moving scene of different characters. Each turn the street moves along, the card closest to the end leaves and everyone else shuffles up with empty spaces filled from the deck. Minions enter from one end of the street and have to get past any intervening guards to reach their targets.

Both editions are packaged in a collector's tin and each card has a photo of a character or ship from the original Star Trek television show (photos are unique to card values).

WHAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO:


     When you are down to one card, instead of shouting UNO you must instead exclaim Space, the final UNO frontier!
     Each edition also includes four exclusive cards that alter gameplay from that of traditional UNO.
         The Mattel edition features four Star Fleet Command cards (descriptions from instruction sheet):
             Live Long and Prosper (Wild and New Hand) Card - This card can be played on any card.  After playing this card, you must discard your old hand and draw an entirely new hand.  You then call any color to continue play, including the one presently being played if desired.  NOTE: You can only draw the same number of cards held in your hand after playing this card.
             Mind Meld Card - This card can be played on any card.  After playing this card, you command the next player to show his/her hand to you.
             Beam Me Up, Scotty (Wild and Stop) Card - Play this card immediately to stop a Command card that is directed to you.  You then call any color and play continues.
             Double Tribble Card - This card can be played on any card.  After playing this card, you may call any color to continue play, including the color presently being played if desired.  The next player must double the number of cards in his/her hand by drawing additional cards and forfeit his/her turn.
        
         The Fundex edition includes four Beam Up WILD cards that can negate the effects of any DRAW 2 or DRAW 4 WILD cards played against a player. That player can then call a new color, and play resumes as if they had played a regular WILD. (It can also be used as a regular WILD if desired.)

Chicago gang leader Harold Hal Coppone was released today from Awsume State Penitentiary near Philadelphia after serving a six-month term. Coppone, who was jailed for carrying an unlicensed weapon, was met by a group of his men - among them was Chicago gangster Joey The Rattlesnake Ratello, chief suspect in the recent killing of Marco Machete Molino - and departed quickly in a powerful seven-passenger Lincoln Touring car. While he had nothing to say to the press, Coppone and his men were undoubtedly headed back to Chicago where, it is rumored, they have more than one score to settle.

A dice and tile press-your-luck word game for 2-6 players. Using a combination of wooden tiles and artisan dice, players attempt to create words based on their dice roll. Each letter die multiplies the word score. Players must then decide whether to stop and score or draw another die, roll again, and risk it all!

Each letter and die has a point value similar to Scrabble. The twist is in the multiplication of your score by the number of letter dice used.

In each round, the player begins by rolling one die. The player uses that die and nine wooden tiles to make a single word. The player can stop there and score, or bank the used tiles to score later, take an additional die, roll both dice, and make a new word with the remaining tiles. This new word will now be scored with a multiplier of 2 (with 2 dice). Players can continue with this adding dice and making words as long as they have tiles left. If a player fails to make a word, they score only their banked tiles with no multipliers.

The goal of every player is to construct four out of the six buildings listed on his objective card.

Each turn, players receive money from their professions, then use the money to bid for new professions and to cast votes on the buildings to be added to town. The professions employed by a player influence the income of that player as well as the income of the player on his left, making the game fun and unpredictable. Every profession has up to 4 abilities, banning other professions from the game, adding a bonus for bidding on a specific building and providing extra income if some specific building/profession card is in the game.

There are 12 Character cards from which the players can choose, each with a special ability, adding to the game diversity.

You and your fellow monkeys jump in the bumper cars and away you go. You have no idea why there is fruit all over the arena floor, but you aim to grab as much of it for yourself as possible!

Game synopsis:

Spin Monkeys has each player starting on a junction at the edge of the board with a hand of 5 cards.  The cards have 8 possible degrees of rotation from 45 to a full 360 degrees.  On each turn players choose a card, rotate their monkey clockwise to the degree, then move one junction per played card in front of them.  On the first turn you only go one junction, but as the game goes you can travel more junctions as you play more cards, picking up all the fruit you glide over, apples, oranges and bananas, leaving peels. Some cards have text that let you do special actions, like taking more fruit, or rotating during your movement.  As you go faster, traveling more junctions per turn, it becomes harder to avoid running into the sides of the board or other monkeys.  When you bump into the side of the board you lose cards, slowing you down.  If you crash into another monkey you get to spin them, and steal a piece of fruit.  After you play your hand, you get 5 new cards to direct your monkey with. Game goes until only one kind of fruit is left on the board. Most points in fruit wins!

Each player begins in an unknown location on an island (the opponent picks where the other starts), and each has the same goal: find the hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.

In play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.

The game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is live, and also the six surrounding terrain types. The board is well designed so that with a few clues you can narrow down the options of spots.

Waterloo was the final and most decisive land battle of the Napoleonic Wards, and possibly the most famous battle of all time. Napoleonic warfare was complex in its variety, and victory or defeat depended on the successful application of such diverse factors as organization and command control, leadership and training, formation and position, firepower, combined arms tactics, luck, and, especially, morale. These aspects of the Battle of Waterloo are accurately modeled in this game. Can you, as the Iron Duke of Wellington, hold the French at bay until night or the Prussians arrive? Can you, as Blucher, old Vorwarts, drive forward in time to save the day?

Every unit that participated in the historical battle is represented--British, Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian, Nassau, Brunswick, King's German Legion, French, and Prussian infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The rules cover all the key factors in the battle, line, column, square, and ordere-mixte formations, skirmishers, routing and rallying, leader effects and casualties, cavalry reaction and recall, artillery capture and recapture, hidden units, fatigue, the elan and mobility of the French infantry columns, and the firepower and staying power of the thin red line of British infantry.

In OMEGA, players try to create groups of their colors by placing stones in a hexagonal grid, in order to score the most points. But each player places stones of all colors in play.

The final score for each color is calculated by multiplying the sizes of the different groups of that color.

Thanks to the 6 acrylic 'corners' included in the game, it can be played on various board sizes. From 5-hexes side to 10-hexes side. Other board shapes can be configured, too.

You will soon realize that you dont need to calculate your score during play (multiplying your group values). Use an intuitive strategy instead. How? You must figure it out by yourself.

2-player games of size beyond 8 are only recommended for experienced players and scores are often gigantic.

OMEGA was initially designed for 2 players. The designer then added the 3 and 4 player option, but the gameplay is completely different.

It is based in feudal Japan with Samurai of various clans fighting to support their lord's quest to become Emperor. There are also shugenja (mages), Dragons, Naga, and hordes of evil demons (Oni). You get a certain number of points to build an army, and armies must typically have units that are either from the same clan or unaligned. You can be units from other clans, but they cost a premium (usually 20% above list price).  Typically, personalities lead units, which is some number of basic troops (usually samurai). A good personality can cost as much as 30 or 40 basic troops, but most cost around 10 times more. Leaders, and occasionally units, have skills. Skills are used to modify initiatives, absorb damage, boost morale, and the like. Many personalities (and some units) also have skills that are unique to that personality / unit.

In addition to the units, each player also has a customized deck of thirty cards. These cards let the player make special moves, pass morale tests, and do other acts of courage. Each player builds their own deck (just like in a collectable card game) and typically draws a card a turn, although one player gets to draw two. Since a game lasts about 6-10 turns, a player should expect to see 1/3 rd to 1/2 of their deck (you start with three cards) in a battle.

After setting up, a turn looks like the following:


     Determine Initiatives,
     Do Special Stuff,
     Move,
     Cavalry Move Again,
     Shoot,

Noble House is a game based on the novel by James Clavell. In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.

Synopsis of play:

During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own voting stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase. Otherwise, the game ends on the turn when the last event card is drawn.

Each card in Spot it! On the Road features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next. Any two cards have exactly one animal in common. For the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins!

Rules for different games  each an observation game with a speed element  are included, with the first player to find a match either gaining or getting rid of a card.

What's more, the symbols in Spot it! On the Road are all items that you'd see during a typical road trip, and this edition contains a new way to play: One card is revealed, and all players scan the scenery to spot items shown on the card. Whoever spots such an item first claims the card.

The real speaker knows how to charm the audience with the greatest dilemma, predicting the opinions thanks to a supernatural intuition... or a more practical cheating technique!

In Ostrakon, you take the role of a Greek philosopher, posing questions on assigned topics with only 2 answers. The other players decide which of the two answers suits them, and the philosopher secretly votes with the side he thinks will outnumber the other. If he is correct, he scores points equal to the number of players who voted against his choice. If he is incorrect, he scores nothing. So its best to pick questions with roughly equally viable answers.

Uncertainty didnt kill the cat, but that doesnt mean its not dead. Dr. Erwin Schrdinger and Werner Heisenberg taught us that. Weve all heard about the cats in boxes experiment and maybe we're even curious about the results -- but attempting such an experiment would be INSANE in real life! Now you can try your hand at challenging the uncertainty principle without risking the lives of innocent kittens or exposure to radioactive particles! Awww!

In Schrdingers Cats players run experiments, form hypotheses, and try to one-up each others research. Players take on the role of a Cat Physicist such as Albert Felinestein, Sally Prride, or Neil deGrasse Tabby! Using their special ability to help prove their hypothesis, or at least debunk someone elses, each cat physicist tries to determine the minimum number of alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes across all the boxes in Schrdingers lab.

You may not be certain your hypothesis is valid, but if you love cats, science, and games you will be certain to love the Schrdinger's Cats card game!

Ultimate Werewolf is a group game/activity where each of the players take on secret roles in a village that's being terrorized by werewolves. Some of the players are werewolves, many are plain, simple villagers, but many players have special abilities, such as being able to tell who is a werewolf and who isn't, and the Magician, who can save or kill any other player instantly. Each night the werewolves eat a villager. Each day, the village convenes and attempts to lynch one of their own, trying to find the werewolves that are secretly living among them.

The Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition package from Bezier Games makes this game easier to play than ever before, and supports up to 31 players! Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition includes a number of components to make your games faster, more intriguing, and more fun than ever before:

31 Sleeved Player Cards: These lavishly illustrated full-color cards contain the name of the role and a short description of that role's abilities. There's no confusion as to what each card is and what that role does. Each player card comes in a plastic sleeve with a sliding insert that covers the card face. There's no chance of accidentally flipped, dropped, or otherwise revealed cards.

Getting Started with Ultimate Werewolf Guide: This handy guide provides information and advice about everything related to setting up and moderating an Ultimate Werewolf game, from how to set up the chairs for the players to how to keep the game moving along.

Player Reference Cards: 30 full-size reference cards with a complete role listing and explanation on one side, and a detailed walk-through of the gameplay on the other.

Moderator Reference Cards: Reference cards for the Moderator with a detailed walk-through (including what to say at each step of the game) on one side, and role identity charts to fill out during the first night - never get confused over who is the hunter or any other role!

Role Suggestion Card: A handy reference card that suggests the right mix of werewolves, villagers, and special roles for players in any number from 7-31.

Name Card Tents: Included are 30 name card tents so all players can address each other by name; great for large groups, visitors, and team-building events.

The Amulet of Protection: One player secretly has an Amulet of Protection that will prevent him from dying one time. At night he may pass the Amulet to another player. Any role may have the Amulet, which is a smaller card that is inserted between the role card and the sliding insert.

Custom Cards: If you're an experienced player who likes to play with a certain role not included in the base set, you can select an additional role from a list, or even have custom cards made and enclosed with your order.

Unique custom roles found only in Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition: The Village Idiot, Wolf Cub, Aura Seer and Spellcaster.

Can we predict what will happen to us depending on the color of the shirt we decided to wear this morning? And what about the choices of others, do they affect ours? Can we go to bed resting assured that all our objectives have been met?

Kenta throws players into uncertainty, into chaos, into the others influences on our own destiny. It is a race, not against time, but against the unpredictable.  The Kenta Finish line marker moves at the players will and crossing it first does not guarantee victory.

In this chaotic race, once a player has crossed the Finish line, all players sprint by adding up points achieved during the race itself, their cards, and secret objectives for each player. Thus, even if you cross the Finish line first, victory may not be yours!

315,Bagh Chal,1000,5.91961,153,2.3889,2,2,20,20,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Grid MovementVariable Player Powers,"Bagh Chal is a traditional abstract game that is popular in Nepal. The name roughly translates to Tigers Moving. It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.

The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.

It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.
See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.

Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar. See the according image galleries of these games.

88113,Isaac,2011,7.24545,33,2.5,2,2,15,15,Abstract,Abstract Strategy ,Tile Placement,"Isaac is an abstract strategy game for two players.

The game is divided in two different phases, placement and scoring.

During the placement, a player places one of his rectangular pieces on the available spaces of a 1010 square grid board.

During the scoring, each player removes one of his pieces from the board, scoring a number of points equal to the number written on the removed piece times the number of pieces that lie on the row/column from which the piece was removed. A piece can be removed only if it is at least long as the longest piece already removed by the same player.

Each player uses his/her own counter to keep track of his/her points but the counter itself is placed on the board (that is, the board is also the score track). The presence of a counter on the row/column from which a piece is taken doubles the points scored. A player can decide to score less points than he/she earned, therefore allowing to place the score counter in a more convenient place.

You can play Foundations and Hari with an Isaac set.

Incomplete Victory

Napoleon's strategy was to cross the border in secret and attack the Allied armies before they could combine and outnumber his army. If he could engage them separately, then his army would outnumber theirs in individual engagements. To that end, he had sent Ney's 2nd Corps and 3rd Cavalry Corps to block the Allied army at the crossroads of Quatre Bras on the same day, so that it could not proceed down the Nivelles-Namur road to bolster the right of the Prussian position.

The Prussians had deployed along the Ligny Brook. They held all the farmhouses and a good defensive position, with most of their advance forces under cover. In fact the Prussian three army corps' positions were so good, that Napoleon at first was deceived into thinking there was only one army corps. However, Blcher had overstretched his left flank, and exposed his right to French artillery.

Included in the Napoleon's Last Battles Quadrigame.  It was sold separately as a folio game.

Folio version includes rules, a 17 x 22 map and 100 counters.

It includes three separate games, namely March to Peking, Zulu War and The Sudan.  The game includes a core set of rules used in all three scenarios and scenario-specific rules unique to each game.  Optional rules add further chrome and complexity to the game.

March to Peking depicts the Anglo-French attack on China in 1860 to force it to open itself up to European trade.  Special rules allow for the veteran Chinese Hunan army (engaged fighting the Taiping rebels elsewhere) to march to Peking's relief.

Zulu War depicts the British campaigns in 1879 against the Zulus in South Africa.

The Sudan covers three separate campaigns; the 1883-85 Mahdist uprising in Sudan, the defence of Khartoum in 1884-85, and the recapture of Sudan in 1896-98.

The game consists of rules, two 34 x 22 maps and 620 counters.

Each year the Hamburger family escapes into the great outdoors for a little rest and relaxation. During their stay eager animals scavenge for food that has been left unattended to take home and make meals of their own.

Light enough to delight brand new gamers and yet versatile enough to intrigue the saltiest veterans, this game is a must have! Scavengers is a card-based family game. The game's compact box makes it easy to take camping or over to the neighbors for game night. This game is sure to leave your friends and family hungry for more!

Game Play: Each round players compete for food scraps at three different camps to try and fill up their food cards. Competition is both offensive and defensive as players try to claim the food scraps they need whilst blocking others from getting the food scraps they want. Players win food scraps at camps by playing Scavenger cards with varying strengths and special effects that affect game play and alter the victory conditions at each camp. The first player to fill up all of their food cards with food scraps is the winner!

147145,Primate Fear,2013,6.2525,80,1,2,6,45,45,,Card Game Humor Zombies ,Dice RollingPlayer EliminationTake That,"Primate Fear is set in the same world as Gigantoskop's Spank the Monkey and is compatible with that game and its expansions, but this time when you start monkeying around in a junkyard, you'll find it a much darker experience as this junkyard was built on an old haunted cemetery.

As in Spank the Monkey, players scrounge around trying to find junk to build towers and locate parts for reinforcements to make the towers stronger, but they're not trying to reach the monkey and spank it this time. Oh, no. On the contrary, they are trying to get as far away from it as possible because this monkey is not a mischievous nuisance but rather a reanimated zombie monstrosity of an ape. Once the players have stumbled over all the monkey parts and the monkey awakes, it will climb after the players, eating the brains of the ones it catches until only one player remains  the winner.

In game terms, each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player draws 1-2 cards, then plays at most one Junk card to start or continue building his tower and at most one Reinforcement card to strengthen his highest Junk card. He can also play one or more Attack cards on opponents to try to demolish their towers, lowering them within reach of Frankenmonkey. Players can use Defense cards to try to ward off attacks, with the active player rolling a die to see whether an attack succeeds. If it does, that player's tower might further crumble as the junk collapses on top of other junk.

Each time a player uses a card with a monkey claw on it, a new part is added to Frankenmonkey on the assembly board; if the monkey is complete, then the claw raises the monkey up one level on the height board. At the end of each player's turn, the monkey (if still complete) rises one level, eliminating players at that same height.

Players can use Primate Fear cards with Spank the Monkey rules and vice versa, or they can combine the games, with the goal being to spank the monkey before anyone else while still having your brain intact.

But when the contracts get bought, players will need to negotiate a deal, because it's very difficult to build a decent sized building on your own.

177053,Road To Infamy,2016,7.57816,38,1,2,4,30,45,,Card Game Mafia ,Auction/BiddingHand ManagementSimultaneous Action SelectionTake ThatTrick-taking,"Road to Infamy, is a fast-paced bidding, gangster-themed game for 2-4 players. Road to Infamy is all about anticipating what moves your opponents will make, taking risks, and playing counter moves. Its simple enough to learn in 3 minutes, yet deep enough where you are discovering new strategies every time you play it. But best of all, its always your turn.

Players start with a hand of 6 bids. Bids are valued 1 - 5 with the lower valued cards containing some game changing actions. Players chose a bid and place it face down in the ready position. When everyone is ready the bids are simultaneously revealed. The bids colors signify what you are bidding on. Red bids recruit gangsters with unique abilities, green bids buy various types of Contraband (worth victory points), and blue bids bribe the Cop, which protects your points and forces the competition to lose theirs. After 3 rounds the highest bidder for a given color wins the corresponding prize. Players take their winnings and reset the board for the next hand.

Player interaction comes from the actions on the lower numbered bid cards. Actions allow you to steal your rivals contraband, assassinate their mercenaries, and put the odds in your favor.

Each gangster has their own unique ability that is active throughout the entire game. Depending on which gangsters you recruit, different strategies will become available. For example, the Mob Boss gives you an additional Victory Point for each Gangster on your team, this card pairs well with the Recruiter who gives you a permanent +2 to your red bid total. This combination helps you outbid your opponents for new gangsters and earn you victory points when you do so.

The game ends after 12 rounds of bidding. The player with the most victory points wins.

145478,HeartSwitch,2013,6.24776,67,2.1667,3,6,0,0,,Card Game ,Trick-taking,"The object of HeartSwitch  a card game inspired by Hearts  is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. The sixty-card deck consists of the standard 52-card deck, plus four Magicians and four Witches, two good and two bad, with Witches ranking between Jacks and Tens.

As in Hearts, HeartSwitch is a trick-taking game with fairly standard rules. The lead player plays a single card, then each other player must follow suit, if possible  except that a player can always choose to play a Magician. A Magician is a null card that can never win a trick (unless a trick consists only of Magicians). Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led collects the cards, then leads to the next trick.

After everyone's hand is empty, players score points for the cards they've collected. As in Hearts, each heart collected is one point, while the Queen of Spades is 13 points. What's new in HeartSwitch is that the Witch of Spades is worth 5 points, while the Witch of Clubs cancels points earned for either of the Spades cards. The Witch of Hearts doubles points earned from hearts up to a maximum of 15 points, while the Witch of Diamonds knocks up to 5 points off your score. If a player shoots the moon by collecting all the hearts and either the Witch or Queen of Spades (or both), that player scores no points while everyone else scores 20, 25 or 30 points.

Players continue playing rounds until one player reaches 70 points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins. Alternatively, players can agree to play a set number of rounds, with the lowest-scoring player winning the game.

Britannia in Afghanistan

In 1842 Afghan rebels destroyed a British army as it tried to fight its way from Kabul to the safety of the Khyber Pass. The British launched an expedition to avenge that defeat, and that led to another campaign in Central Asias Great Game. Khyber Rifles is a two-player game of that fateful year in Afghanistan.

One player commands British forces, including the regiments and battalions forming the armies of Gens. Nott, Pollock and Elphinstone. The other player controls various Afghan tribal contingents, led by Akbar Khan. The point-to-point map covers eastern Afghanistan and Indias Northwest Frontier area, including the famous Khyber Pass.

Khyber Rifles is part of the Hand of Destiny mini-game series. Each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate movement abilities, combat bonuses and historical events. Accessing the right card at the right time lets the player concentrate forces to win that great victory against all oddsor perhaps go down to inglorious defeat. Some of the cards include: Ambush, Jirga Loya, Mad Dash and Relief Force.

Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. There are special rules for: elite British units, fanatic Afghan Ghazis, camp followers, Shah Shujahs army, and irregular units such as Broadfoots Pioneers.

Players explore the territory while fighting enemy troops with knights, soldiers, a Pegasus, and captured dragons.

In order to gain victory points, they can kill their opponents or manage to place some of their characters in strategic points on the map.

Each pawn has its own constraints, e.g. all cannot move in every direction, or have the same movement points and fight points. Some have special abilities.

The Revenue phase is when players collect their hard earned resources, including a small stipend from their home office on Earth. And finally, the turn auction phase is a bidding war for who goes first. Not that important at the start of the game, but monumental for the end.

The combat system is also similar to other Smithsonian games.

The scenarios and soldiers are based upon events and characters in the movie.

The game uses two elements to create fog of war:
-  the counters have small stands so the identity of each counter is unknown to the enemy.  Some of the counters are fakes and substitutes (these are used to combine several counters into a single group.  All counters are placed in an off board box and the matching substitute counter is placed on the map.)
-  Random initiative draw.  Similar to Firepower, chits for each side are placed in a cup and each turn one is randomly drawn to determine which player may move.

Platoon had a AH complexity rating of 3.

They've Invaded Pleasantville minigame is a two player game of secret invasion by space invaders.  One player, the Alien player, moves the Alien-controlled and uncontrolled pieces, and the other player, the Town player, moves the Town-controlled pieces.  There are 12 game turns in this game. In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.

The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she takes over more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.  The Alien player, in short, will try to create a large army of townspeople-zombies, eliminate any opposition, and occupy Pleasantville as a base of operations.  The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlledzombies, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.

The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control. Each turn, the alien player may use misdirection and bluffing to fool the town player as to where the alien mind control is taking place. Real townspeople are swapped out with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars. Especially entertaining is the random Townsperson Movement table that simulates the day to day migration of unsuspecting townspeople as they go about their business in Pleasantville.

Servants of the Imperial Court have been tasked with the mission of harvesting this magic fruit from the Emperor's private gardens. Upon arriving at the Imperial compound, however, the servants are chagrined to discover Raiders from the North climbing the walls, hastening to harvest the fabled fruit for themselves.

In Imperial Harvest, players build a modular board replete with moats and hedges then take turns drafting a unique trio of fantastic champions who will either raid or protect the imperial strawberry patch. To be successful, each player must master the powers of their respective characters, navigate the Imperial Gardens, evade enemy attacks, and collect the majority of the realms mysterious, magical fruit.

Imperial Harvest takes place over 7 rounds (less, if all strawberries are plucked before game-end) and takes roughly 20 minutes to play. A cloth play mat is included in the game box for players that prefer not to create their own modular board or who prefer a quicker game setup. Each character in Imperial Harvest features a basic side (for novice/casual players) and an advanced side (for experienced/competitive players). Additionally, all components (garden tiles, character cards, etc.) are 100% compatible with Royal Strawberries (both games are stand-alone but also expand each other).

IMPERIAL HARVEST: TAG TEAM (allows 2 additional players per additional copy of Imperial Harvest):
Grab another copy of Imperial Harvest, expand your board, and bring a new group of players to the table! With competitive tag-team rules, you and your allies can face-off against a team of worthy adversaries. By pairing skills and chaining more character actions, Imperial Harvest: Tag Team offers new creative strategies for navigating the board and cleverly collecting those precious strawberries. As always, only the craftiest team will win  and watch out for those hydras!

The card was renamed Blood Transfusion, but the cardlist was not updated. You have the correct cards, though.

Game description from the publisher:

Adventure Time Card Wars is the most epic card game ever found in the Land of Ooo, or anywhere for that matter! In the Adventure Time episode Card Wars, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.

Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.

Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!

In Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, which contains all new cards other than a few rainbow card repeats, the Ice King and his IcyLands deck take on Marceline's dark and crafty Useless Swamps  NiceLands deck. IcyLands creatures are all about attacking directly. They would prefer to avoid attacking other creatures. One way they can find some clear lanes to attack down is through frozen tokens. Through various means, these chilling tokens can be placed onto your opponent's Landscapes. Opponents will find playing creatures onto frozen landscapes rather difficult. Where the Ice King finds an opening, he will strike as hard as a blizzard!

Marceline's deck is a Useless Swamps  NiceLands deck. This is the first time that NiceLands has been paired with another landscape type, and the chemistry is going to burn hot! The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around denial, discard, and dirty tricks. Some of the Useless Swamp Creatures are willing victims to your dark tidings. When they go, they leave a lot of destruction in their wake. The NiceLands side of the deck is themed around creatures with exactly five damage on them. This is a tweak to the NiceLands strategy as seen in the original NiceLands deck. There, the creatures thrived with various different amounts of damage on them. Now the trick is to get as many of your creatures as you can to have exactly five damage on them. When that happens, look out!

Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!

This desperate battle has recently seen a new player, a secret Agency of Bounty Hunters, attempting to control the endless assaults on inner city life.

Your task: Defeat and arrest criminals, defuse high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy city districts, and prevent assassins from completing their destructive path. You are one of the members of this secretive brotherhood of justice. So...are you ready to survive the crime waves in the big city and uncover the infiltrating androids amongst your team that plan a revolt?

Rogue Agent is a tense cyberpunk adventure game that pitches players against underground networks. The game features detailed plastic miniatures, a large variety of unique criminals to defeat, special icon-driven custom dice, and two different game play modes.

In Rogue Agent, players control an agent working for the shady corporation known as The Agency, created to control Rain City's crime rate, which has rapidly outpaced the capabilities of the regular police force. Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.

Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs. Meanwhile, the city police squad is hot on your trail, hoping to contain the illegal side jobs that agents are known for. The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.

Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game. As the game develops, agents can upgrade their vehicle, weapon and scout abilities as well as gather information about the true identities of other agents. There might be traitors within the Agency. Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids. These agents have access to new victory conditions  destroying key locations holding information about android production and eliminating human agents  in a deadly race for control of the city. The first player to reach eight power wins.

Rogue Agent is a fast-playing, easy-to-learn adventure, resource management, and risk management game using fun, streamlined icon-driven custom dice mechanisms. The Living City System creates a dynamic board with characters and challenges in constant motion, creating unique situations with each play and making Rain City come alive on your gaming table. No trip to Rain City will be the same!

Voil! is a fast-paced dexterity and push-your-luck type of game that will challenge your agility and finger swiftness.

In Voil! each player tries to get as many points as possible by completing various dexterity tasks. In a turn the player pulls out a token from the bag, which defines how many tasks the player has to complete (either none, one or two). However, for a turn player has limited amount of time, which is kept hidden from him by another player.

After pulling out a token the player draws the corresponding amount of cards and tries to complete the tasks depicted of them. There are many different tasks, for example, throwing the token in the air and catching it, or creating a tower from acrobats and so on. After player has completed the task(s) he can either end the turn and thus get the points, or try to get more points by pulling out a new token and then completing the tasks. However, if the player chooses to continue, he must complete the task before he can end the turn and this is the risk - if the time runs out while he is still performing the task, the turn ends immediately and the player doesn't receive any points this turn (any cards the player completed during this turn are put in the discard pile).

The game ends after each player has had three turns and the winner is the one with most total points on his cards.

101644,Bushido,2011,8.49706,34,3,2,2,90,90,,Fighting Miniatures ,Action Point Allowance SystemDice RollingVariable Player Powers,"From the Developer's Website:

Bushido is an oriental fantasy tabletop miniature battle game for two players. Each player commands a force of no more than a handful of individuals, represented by 32mm metal miniatures. These forces meet on the battlefield and the commanders (the players, that is) try to outwit, outfight and outlive the opposing force and fulfil their battle objectives while denying the enemy theirs. If you have played tabletop miniature games before, Bushido falls into the skirmish game category: all miniatures represent individuals and your force consists of a small group of unique characters rather than a big faceless army. A game of Bushido is fast-moving, flexible and filled with strategizing, counter-strategizing and counter-counter-strategizing. Your tactical acumen is important, but as dice add an element of randomness, so too is your ability to think on your feet. A typical game of Bushido takes between one and two hours to play - more if you are new to the game, less if you are a seasoned veteran.

145549,Islands of the Damned: Wake Island and Peleliu,2015,7.19667,30,1.8889,1,1,180,180,,Wargame World War II ,,"Any study of the early weeks of WWII in the Pacific is certain to notice the campaign for Wake Island, referred to in those dark days as the Alamo of the Pacific. Though the Send more Japs radio line was never actually sent by those on the island (it turned out to be a radio code deception), the spirit of their defense heartened a nation shocked over their losses at Pearl Harbor and bracing for invasion. When the word came out about the island sinking two destroyers and inflicting hundreds of casualties, it gave a nation inspiration and seemed to teach the Japanese that the Americans were not as soft as they anticipated.

But the island did fall.

As a contrast, few studies of WWII in the Pacific will even mention the Battle of Peleliu, an island of marginal value, which might not have been attacked at all, except those in charge expected it to be so easy. Major General William Rupertus, USMC - commander of 1st Marine Division - predicted the island would be secured within four days. The five battleships bombarding the beaches complained that they had run out of targets after a few hours. Both were very wrong. Due to Japan's well-crafted fortifications and stiff resistance, the battle lasted over two months, and has the highest US casualty rate for any battle in the entire Pacific war. (Youve heard of Tarawa and Saipan and Okinawa...and this was worse?) Against the Odds Magazine issue #43 will be a two-game set, called Islands of the Damned. The issue has two separate solitaire games inside:

Given Up for Dead covers Wake Island and Utmost Savagery takes on the lesser-known invasion of Peleliu. Designer Steven Cunliffe tackles both battles with innovative systems that challenges players to mix boldness with good tactics. They must gain objectives but minimize casualties...as the historical commanders would have liked to do.

The Islands of the Damned comes with 175+ large, full-color 5/8 diecut counters, and two separate 17x 22 full color mapsheets.

You will be commanding the American forces in each game, challenged with doing far better than the historical outcomes. Can you save most of your troops from the Islands of the Damned?

    To add to a row, add the die value played to the number on the top card of one of your rows, then take this card from the display.


If another player has used a desired card in one of her rows, steal it from her row and use it for yourself. You can have at most three rows in progress. At the end of your turn draw back up to two die cards.

When you play a die card to place the 40 card on a row, you then score the row, earning one point for each card in the row plus one point for each star on cards in that row. Record this score on paper, then return these cards to the display.

The game ends when a player scores 30, 35, or 40 points, with this total being dependent on the number of players: 2, 3, or 4.

Turned and trooped the goblin men
With their shrill repeated cry,
Come buy, come buy.

Dealing with goblins is always a struggle with temptation, leading through in the loss of innocence, ultimately revealing the power of sisterhood. Yet goblins are oblivious to symbolism. For them, it is just a matter of economics.

This Decktet game, inspired by Christina Rossetti's poem of the same name, is a series of auctions in which players buy cards on the goblins' terms: They'll give you coins for nothing, until you've won some auctions --- but later, your only way to get more coins will be from your fellow players.

This description is adapted from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.

Will you succeed in finding your opponent's speakeasy with your clan of gangsters before he finds yours?

To set up Speakeasy, each player places his 25 pieces on the game board with the values visible only to him. Players then take turns moving along the streets and alleys, even entering the buildings that serve as a stash. When two pieces meet, the piece with the highest value scares away the opponent, removing him from the city. Special pieces move faster than others or scare away all opponents before disappearing themselves.

Inspired by Lu Zhan Qi, a Chinese game that has proven its excellence for many years, Speakeasy requires memory and anticipation in games full of bluffing.

The successful offensive of early autumn 1943 found the Soviets with several bridgeheads over the Dnepr River. The largest of these, located north of Kiev, erupted on 3 November as infantry and tank units of the 1st Ukrainian Front burst through the German line. Soon Soviet tank columns were racing to the distant towns of Fastov and Zhitomir, mauling several German panzers divisions hastily brought up to stem the Red tide. On 12 November, however, the Germans managed to assemble a powerful striking force centered around the 1st and 1st SS Panzer Divisions, threw them at the overextended formations of the Red Army, and rolled them back. Over the next four weeks the action see-sawed back and forth as reserves were committed and attack followed counterattack.

One side represents the German forces of the 4th Panzer Army while the other side controls the Red Army forces of 1st Ukrainian Front. It uses the highly popular game system used in Ring of Fire and East Wall.

73253,Chalons: The Fate of Europe,2010,6.76786,42,1.875,1,2,60,60,,Ancient Wargame ,Hex-and-CounterSimulation,"(from Decision Games' website:)

Throughout the mid-5th century AD, Attila's Huns terrorized Europe. The skill of the Hun horsemen, particularly their accuracy with the composite bow while mounted, made them a veritable shock army. They continued to bring victory after victory to Attila, making him the master of Central Europe. After years of conquest, oppression and extortion, however, Attila's recent invasion of Western Europe would be challenged: a remnant Roman army, under the command of Flavius Aetius, was sent to stop him on a field known as the Catalaunian Plain, near the village of Chalons. The Battle of Chalons would decide the fate of Europe.

Chalons utilizes the tried-and-true Battles of the Ancient World system, providing a simple yet accurate portrayal of ancient warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized warfare in the era of sword and shield. Various units may simply be swordsmen, while others may be archers or javelin throwers, horsemen, etc. The system includes rules for leaders, charges, melee, diversionary attacks, demoralization and more. A group of barbarians, for example, may be ordered to charge an enemy phalanx that had already hurled their javelins. As the barbarians near the phalanx, however, they may be ambushed by enemy ballistas hidden behind the ranks and waiting to disrupt just such a charge.

In Chalons the traditional design of the classic Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the true strictures of ancient warfare. Famous leaders, such as Attila, also influence combat, replicating the importance of their presence during battle. Winning will depend on deployment, maneuver and opportunity, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.

Oh, and they'll need to search quickly, too, or else the giants will wake from the sleeping spell cast on them and run the searchers out of the forest. Who can combine speed, control and a good memory to find the imps where they hide?

To set up, players place the 16 imp tokens in the holes on the game board, cover these imps with the 85 cardboard leaves included in the game, then place one large wooden giant on each corner of the board. On a turn, the active player reveals a search card showing one of the imps. An opponent flips the sand timer, then the player uses her magic wand to push the leaves aside and (fingers crossed!) find the imp on the search card. She can use her wand to move the giants as well, but if they fall off the game board  or even so much as a single leaf falls  the giants awaken and chase the player away empty-handed. If the player reveals the target imp, though, she keeps the search card to record her find. After each search, players cover the board again and return the giants to their places. In the end, whoever has collected the most search cards wins!

Die verzauberten Rumpelriesen includes rules for cooperative play, with the players using their wands together to search for the imps one by one as they're revealed by the search cards. If the players find more than eight imps without the giants awakening, they win.

You're trying to collect as much gold as possible each round, and the player (team) with the most gold after the predetermined number of rounds wins.

Each round, players start with seven cards in hand; cards feature numbers from 1 to 10, as well as negative numbers, cards that can be either positive or negative, and special plays such as the dragon and wizard. One player leads by playing a card to her horde (the table in front of her); if she plays a 1, she can play again immediately. The next player must follow  playing to his own horde first  and have an equal or higher total in his horde at the end of his turn. If he can't, he loses the trick; if he can, the opponent gets to play again and play continues back-and-forth until one player loses.

Whoever wins collects 1 gold, plus 1 Gold for each Gold card in the pot. The winner draws one card and either keeps it or keeps the next card in the deck; the loser draws two cards (one of them being the card left by the other player, if any). Play continues until all 16 Gold have been claimed, at which point a winner is determined for the round.

In a four-player game, you and your teammate share a horde and take turns playing into it.

Scallywags, originally available as a print-and-play game titled Doubloons!, is a light-hearted game in which players are swashbuckling pirates divvying up their booty.

To start the game, a selection of coins are dumped in the center of the table to form the loot pile. These coins are marked on only one side and are left face-up or face-down as they fall. On a player's turn, he can either take a face-down coin from the pile and add it to his stash or play one card (from three in his hand) to take face-up coins, steal from others, give coins to opponents, and more.

Why would you want to give coins to others? Because once a player has ten coins, he can't receive any more  which means you want to stuff them with all the pennies while making a play for the gold yourself. Once all players have collected ten coins, the game ends and the player with the most valuable stash wins!

In Tricked-Out Hero, players select a character class, then play hands of cards to improve their health, magic, or melee strength based on what tricks are taken before facing monsters in battle. But beware, if you take tricks with spades, they add to the strength of the monster that you face off against at the end of the round. Players play through three levels with several monsters, and the player with the most victory points from defeated monsters and collected wins.

74312,"The Rhineland War, 1936-37",2011,7.18,30,3.25,1,2,240,240,,Wargame World War II ,Hex-and-Counter,"The Rhineland Crisis War, 1936-37, designed by Joseph Miranda,is a strategic-level simulation of intermediate complexity that covers an alternative World War II in Europe, one that began in 1936. The assumption is, when Hitler ordered his army to march into the Rhineland, the Allied powers, instead of appeasing him, ordered their armed forces to resist. The ensuing chain of events leads to the war expanding throughout Europe. A war fought at that time wouldve found all European militaries woefully unprepared.

Central to the play of the game are its crisis chits. They represent various diplomatic and military events that could bring other powers into the war. Players pick crisis chits depending on the number of crisis hexes (printed on the map) they control. The more such hexes they control, the greater the chances they have of gaining more allies. At the same time, grabbing too much territory can lead to political collapse at home, as domestic foes work to undermine your power before the conflict explodes into a wider war.

Rhineland Crisis War is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries that choose to align with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one month. Units of maneuver are corps and armies.

Special rules cover: crises, political collapse, reinforcements, replacements, terror bombing, railroads, fog of war, airpower, naval and amphibious operations, weather, neutrals, the Soviet Union, armistice and surrender, the Spanish Civil War, expeditionary forces, airborne units, air transport, fifth columns, alpine units, and anti-aircraft units. The turn sequence is as follows.

I. Axis Player Turn
 A. Axis Mobilization Phase
 B. Axis Terror Bombing Phase
 C. Axis Movement Phase
 D. Axis Combat Phase
 E. Axis Rally Phase
 F. Axis Crisis Phase
II. Allied Player Turn

Dashing ahead with your chariot, slowly at first, but quickly gaining speed circling the spina in the center of the arena to complete the first lap. The next corner comes closer. Glancing back, one of the chariots is already far behind, and just ahead another chariot's speed is too high for the corner, sending the vehicle crashing into the wall and out of the race. Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it's time to get uncivilized. Steadily you balance the javelin in your hand, waiting for the other charioteer to come into viewor should you just overtake him and throw caltrops in his path?

In Chariot Race: Das groe Wagenrennen, players participate as charioteers in a great race in ancient Rome. Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena's circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player's turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot's speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.

However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle  which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.

On a turn, the active player announces which one of the answers not yet chosen is correct. All of the other players now either join him in this opinion or quit the round. The player then moves the slider, and if he was correct, all players who haven't yet quit benefit  but maybe he was wrong...

Players who quit the round cannot rejoin for later answers, giving up any additional profit for each subsequent correct answer, so the main challenge of the game is to quit at the right time.

The game plays in 4 turns where each player plays a ruler from history and conquers territories using a simple dice mechanic.
The deck of world conquerors cards generates effects and goals to modify and drive the action.  If nobody has conquered the world by the end of the 4th turn to win immediately, the player whose empire got the largest at any given point wins.

Each card can be played in one of 3 ways: Generals allow you to place a pawn in that card's territory to be used for rerolls in combats in or adjacent to the territory.  Playing cards as agents gives you one time effects that reflect that historical figure's abilities (Stalin assassinates, Victoria adds an extra die on a naval attack).  Playing cards as rulers gives you their ability for the duration of your turn and sets a goal that reaching it will net you a power bonus at the end of your turn.

At the start of your turn, you're issued a number of tokens.  This number escalates by one during each player turn to ramp up the epic nature of the game.  You also get the bonus when somebody plays a ruler (including you) in one of your territories, and you'll get it at the end of your turn if you reach your ruler's goals. Tokens convert into armies controlling territories in successful attacks and are spent to pay for failed attacks and sea attacks as a Supply Cost.  Each time you pay the Supply Cost, it escalates.

				
					Gameplay Details

On your turn, you campaign by throwing one die for each territory you control adjacent to a target territory. The defender throws one die for their defending army plus another for each adjacent territory they control. The highest die wins. Losses and Naval attacks have an escalating Supply Cost. When you are unwilling or unable to pay the Supply cost, your turn ends. Make it count, though, because you only get four turns.

Strategic depth is layered onto this simple system by the deck of conqueror cards. Each historical figure has special powers based on their history, such as Erik the Red making unsupplied naval attacks, or Stalin using assassination to eliminate enemies. The cards may be played as your empire's ruler (which makes their power last your whole turn), a local agent (which gives you the power just once), or a general (which ignores their power but gives you combat rerolls). Ruler cards also have a strategic goal, such as Elizabeth's No one else controls a continent or Caesar's Win 5 attacks. Fulfilling these goals gets you a power bonus at the end of your turn.

In the grand tradition of global conquest games, World Conquerors is epic in scope, but it addresses the genre's traditional shortcomings.


     Short Play Time - just four turns per player each game. It plays in about an hour. 



     No Player Elimination - each turn you get a new ruler, regardless of the last one's fate.



     Quick combat resolution - one army per territory makes battles quick and easy, focusing strategy on card play instead of mass dicefests. 



     Reduced Kingmaking and Spoiling - ruler goals drive the action leaving little room for spite. 



     No Hopeless Positions - supply is based on both time and territory, so it's possible to rebuild a shattered empire from no territories at all. Everybody is in it until their last turn, unless somebody conquers the whole world and wins instantly.

Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.

Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.

The base token is worth five points, regular characters worth one point, and bonus items worth three points.

The game concludes in mid-August 1941, at which time, historically, 20 Soviet divions surrendered in the Uman Encirclement.

The game contains a wealth of different unit types - including bridging units, motorcycle infantry, an armored train, a Soviet river flotilla, combat engineers, rocket artillery, anti-aricraft units, et., etc. - as well as the more standard armored, mechanized, and infantry units.  Supply, weather, and terrain all play their part, as do fortifications, strongpoints (these can be built each turn), air power, artillery, reinforcements and replacements, headquarters units, and reserves.  The game sequence includes reaction movement by units in reserve status, as well as separate motorized movement phases.  A particularly eleqant piece of design has the Axis motorized movement following standard movement and combat - thus facilitating armored breakthrough; for the Soviets the order is reversed, leading to poorer coordination between tanks and infantry...

There are 4 scenarios - The Siege of Kiev is an introductory scenario lasting 7 turns, and using only Map B.  Rundstedt Attacks depicts the German assault on perhaps the strongest portion of the Soviet frontier; it last 5 turns and uses only Map A.  Secenario 3, Optional Deployment, is a variant of #2.  The Campaign Game lasts 27 turns and uses all 3 maps.  Victory is judged both in terms of combat losses, and the Axis capture of key geographical objectives.

Historically accurate, fast paced, and playable - Blitzkrieg in the South is a worthy first entry in what will surely become the definitive East Front Series.

Will you be the next ruler of the elemental planes?

In addition, each element has its counter element and all counter element tiles touching the elemental reduce its power.

The player with the most elemental power surrounding an aether tile wins it for him/herself. At the end end of the game, the player score points for each won Aether tile as well points for elemenentals left unused. The player with the most points is the winner.

Players roll dice and move colored snails on the board. Along the way, they try to push opponents and get as many delicious mushrooms as they can. Until the very end nobody knows which snail belongs to which opponent, which guarantees great excitement. The game has simple rules, and victory is decided by tactics and the ability to bluff.

In Pędzące Ślimaki: Na jednej nodze (Running Snails: On one leg) every player controls two out of five snails. It may happen that some snails are controlled by two players. On a turn a player rolls the dice, chooses one of them and moves a snail with a color corresponding to the chosen die. After that she passes to the next player all dice but the chosen one. When the number of dice passed is reduced to one then the current receives all of the dice.

The game ends when one of the snails finishes the race. At this point snails are awarded points: 5 for 1st place, 2 for 2nd place and 3 for last place. Snails can also earn points during the race by landing on a mushrrom or pushing back other snails. The player who has the most point at the end of the game is the winner.

Guns of the Askari (GoA) recreates the imperial struggle for East Africa during WWI. This often overlooked campaign featured classic land battles, naval engagements between lake flotillas, cruiser duels at sea and finally hit and run guerrilla engagements. It opened with conventional force-on-force battles dominated by infantry, machine guns, and trenches. But the low troop densities and wide open spaces enabled a war of movement spearheaded by South African cavalry that broke the stalemate in mid 1916. This left Von Lettow-Vorbeck a choice between surrender or guerrilla war. He chose the latter and dragged his weary pursuers through a series of running battles in Portuguese East Africa.

Designed by WWI game specialist John Gorkowski, Guns of the Askari features 280 half-inch full color counters that represent forces as varied as rifle companies, armored cars, naval units for oceans or lakes, and the supply units on which both sides depended. There are even artillery units back-printed with the other sides colors, so that they can be captured and used again.

The game offers four different scenarios, from the complete campaign to the 1918 guerrilla operation and two periods in between. Combat mechanics change as the nature of the conflict evolves, and each turn has a variable end point.

The game can be played by two OR THREE players, giving the option for German, British, and Belgian players, and making it possible for the neutral Portuguese to (perhaps) join the German side!

Can you, commanding greatly superior numbers, do better than the Allied commanders? Can you, commanding a mix of Europeans and native troops (including sailors from a scuttled German cruiser), manage the right balance of caution and audacity to keep your foes off-balance and elude destruction? The choices are yours in Against the Odds Magazine #38, Guns of the Askari.

As sorcerers of the mystical art of Word Weaving, you and several other treasure hunters will descend into the Tomb of the Forgotten Consonant and quest for the Syllabus of the Lost Syllable. When the journey is complete, only the most heroic word smith will walk away with the win.

Dungeon Scroll is a word game where players spell words (cast spells) to meet specific word challenges (dungeon encounters)to score points (gain gold).

A layered dungeon of 9 cards is formed by randomly selecting cards from the Entrance (x1), 1st Floor (x3), 2nd Floor(x3), Dungeon Boss(x1) and Final Room (x1) dungeon cards and combining them into a face down stack. Each turn the top card will be flipped (starting with the Entrance) and players will face the specific encounter on the card. Thematically it could be anything from a Skeleton or Pit Trap to a Travelling Merchant.

Players each have a hand of letter cards from which they will spell words with different points values (letters are worth varying points and some cards provide multiplication bonuses). If the encounter is a combat encounter, typically the player that can play the highest point word will win the encounter and claim the highest gold reward on the dungeon card, with other players claiming the second and third reward - however that is not always true as each dungeon challenge provides twists and turns; to the sorts of words that can be played. Other Special encounters might allow such actions as players to sell their letter cards for gold.

The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.

(or IIGD) is the first ever Dying Card Game (or DCG) from Van Ryder Games. A DCG is a card game in which it is certain that the character(s) WILL die. For 1 to 2 players (expandable to 3 to 4 with a 2nd copy), IIGD is set in a world overrun by zombies. Unlike virtually every other Zombie game, your goal is not to survive, but to kill as many zombies as possible before you die, which results in very engrossing solo or cooperative play.

IIGD puts you smack in the middle of a hopeless scenario where endless zombies lurch and ramble toward you, never stopping until you are dead or become one of them (Zead). You must gather and use weapons and resources to take as many of the abominations as you can with you.

Zombies enter the playing area from several Entry points depending on the scenario. You can take actions during your turn such as Attack, Use an Item, or Search for Resources. Each turn the Zombies will be moved closer and closer and eventually the resources will run out...

Random events or Occurrences that come into play and change the rules keep the game fresh and different every time. The game may be played in a sort of Kill em All mode where you simply try to achieve the best score or you can play one of several Story Arcs that add entertaining story lines to the game where how well you do determines what happens in the story after you die.

The unique mechanisms of the Fate Deck  which determines whether you find a resource when searching and whether you hit or miss during an attack  and the Tracker cards  which are used to keep track of health, ammo, and inventory  make this a game unlike any you have seen before.

One other thing that makes this game unique in the Zombie genre is that each Zombie is illustrated with AMAZING detail and has a character all its own. You may just become more invested in the story of the Zombies than you are in the characters you play!

Hordes of monsters gather near the ancient walls and are about to smash open the castle gates. Mountain giants trample the fields, fire riders burn the surrounding settlements, and the ice dragon has nested on top of the citadel tower, horrifying the minds of the inhabitants of the bastion. Only a squad of stubborn heroes stands between the enemies and their ultimate victory.

Bastion is a cooperative castle defense game set in the Berserk universe, with 1 to 4 players taking on the roles of magical castle defenders. The castle is located in the center of the game board and is menaced by a great variety of invading enemies: dangerous beasts, ferocious warriors, terrible monsters, giants, mages, and even mighty dragons.

You will travel the bastion districts, draw energy from sources of magic, build obelisks, bombard the enemies by magical devices and learn new spells. You will be gathering specific mana that is required to defeat each of the invaders. Victories allow castle defenders to gain new abilities, build powerful artifacts, and perform magic rituals.

To defeat a monster you usually must travel to its location and spend a specific amount of mana of a required color. Each defeated monster provides you with a new spell. The tougher the defeated enemy, the better spell you will get. Castle defenders should try to be as efficient as possible. If you take too many actions to defeat your threats, the bastion will fall.

Bastion is a cooperative adventure: you either defend the city by concerted efforts or it will fall under the pressure of the attacking hordes. Bastion is a highly customizable and replayable game. There are several scenarios and difficulty settings in the rules, along with the solo mode.

No one knew where this catacomb lay, and it remained as such until three hundred years later when the news of its discovery was delivered by the Imperial Capital to the public.

In Aristo-Maze, players are influential aristocrats who are now given the chance to seize some of the legendary loot for themselves. You must hire teams of adventurers and send them into the dangerous trap-filled catacombs to bring back your fortune. The game is played over three rounds, with each round following these phases:


    Providing Phase: Players reset the round and receive new funds.
    Investigation Inquiry Phase: Players bid on which catacomb floor they wish to take a peek at; if they are the highest bidder, they can look at what lurks in that area.
    Recruiting Organization Phase: Players secretly bid on which characters they wish to recruit to become part of their party.
    Exploration Phase: Players secretly choose how far they wish to delve into the dungeon, then resolve the effects of the monsters/traps they encounter which will give them VPs if they survive.


Whoever is able to gain enough VPs from surviving their encounters is victorious!

No money is provided with WRR. This is part of Winsome's Essen 2010 set. (Taken from the Winsome Games homepage)

This game fixes many of the down-time issues with West Riding. The theme is again the United Kingdom during the Industrial Revolution.

Players follow the following turn squence to become the investor who has made the most money. The phases of a turn are: bid on shares, build track, trade shares (at two-to-one: two basic shares for a grouping share), pay dividends, and turn order. If the game ends, either by the game marker (a little wooden locomotive) reaching the end-of-game space OR if all six basic railways have the been finished. When the game is at its end, the Big Payoff begins, whereby players liquidate all of their holdings. The player with the most money wins.

This game did away with the crayon aspect of its predecessor. Cubes are used to show expansion links. Some stocks also begin in the hands of dummy players. This results in the game opening not quite being so wide open. There is an advanced game variant that provides a variable starting setup if the basic game's opening becomes too scripted.

The basic rail companies are: the Midland Railway (red), the London  North Western Railway (black), the North Eastern Railway (brown), the Great Central Railway (blue), the Great Northern Railway (green), and the Lancashire  Yorkshire Railway (yellow). There are eight of each of these shares. The grouping rail companies are: the London  North Eastern Railway (orange) and the London, Midland,  Scottish Railway (pink); both with 12 shares.

36789,Anno Domini: Showbizz,2008,6.72434,38,2,2,8,30,30,,Bluffing Card Game Educational Trivia ,,"Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.
If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.

Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this aint no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because its full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.

Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.

The set Showbizz contains historical events which are related to show business. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the Shwobizz edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.

The Battle of the Bulge is a card game for 2-4 players recreating the famous WWII battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)

The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)

Each match consists of three periods. A period starts with a face-off to decide who's the attacker and who's the defender, and then progresses with the players taking turns either attacking or defending. The period ends when all cards in the deck have been used, and the deck is then reshuffled for the next period.

During a period the attacker uses his attack maneuvers  Pass, Dribble or Shot  to try to score a goal. The defender uses his defense maneuvers  Block, Tackle or Interception  to try to prevent a goal. If the attacker scores a goal or the defender intercepts the ball, the roles are reversed and the game continues.

In addition to the regular attack and defense maneuvers, the players can use special maneuvers to score a lucky shot or intercept the ball using the goalie. It's also possible to foul by making illegal maneuvers, but beware  you don't want the referee to see you.

Forceball consists of 56 cards and is a complete game in itself, not a trading card game. The game is easy to learn, easy to carry around in your pocket, and a period takes less than 15 minutes. It's suitable both as a filler and for lengthy tournaments.

Additionally, players will need a pawn and a common supply of about 30 markers in each of four different colors. The cards form a timeline, allowing players to move back and forth through history to find cheap commodities and then sell for profit.  Of course, all this time travel will shift the timeline, and thus the market for each of the four commodities.

The cards have four pathways from the left to right sides, which cross over each other. They also have a waypoint representing one of the commodities (sheep, neckties, Picassos ... just suggestions from the designer, as they are all pretty abstract!) that can be picked up cheaply at that point in time.

The object is to score 21 points by picking up commodities and selling them at points in the timeline where they are worth obscene amounts of money. However, picking up a commodity changes the timeline in subtle ways: in the game, it means moving a card up or down by a slight amount, which disconnects its current pathways and connects them to new pathways.

The game is played in rounds using a deck of cards, with each card showing a particular type of disciple: monkey, fox, tiger, crane, bear or raccoon (which functions as a joker). Each disciple also has a skill level, shown by a belt: white, yellow, green, blue or black.

During each round, one player is the dealer. Each round consists of three phases: Recruitment, Challenge and Training.

During the recruitment phase, the dealer draws a card, looks at it, and gives it face-down to a player. He repeats this process until each player has been dealt a card.

During the challenge phase, the dealer may be challenged. The player to his left gets the first chance to challenge. If he does not challenge, the next player gets a chance, etcetera, until the dealer is challenged or all players have declined the opportunity to challenge.

If there is a challenge, both players involved (the dealer and the challenger) show their card. The card with the highest value belt wins the challenge (with ties going to the challenger). The winner gains a trophy and may exchange his card with the losers card, if he so desires.

During the training phase, each player adds his card to his dojo. During the first round, the card is simply placed on the table; during later rounds, new cards must be added adjacent to an earlier card. The end result should be a 3x4 grid. A player who has won a trophy must place that trophy next to a column or row.

After twelve rounds, the game ends, and players score points. For each row, players score points for the biggest group of cards of the same type. For each column, players score points if each card shows the same colour belt. Trophies modify the scoring of a row or column.

From the rules:
You are a middle manager trying to manipulate the marble sorting machine to obtain as many marbles as possible for yourself. The board represents the machine which distributes newly-minted marbles from the center and funnels them to one of six goal areas at the edge of the board.  The winning player is the one who can manipulate the process to get the most marbles by the end of the day.

Players manipulate the process by playing Machine Tiles: Machine Parts  Modifiers, or Marbles during their turns. Machine Parts alter the direction or behavior of Marble Tiles that move over them on a turn. Some Machine Part Tiles reverse direction, redirect, push or jump the Marble.
Modifier Tiles allow players to reposition or remove previously played Machine Part Tiles.

Marble Tiles are printed with a directional arrow and a value from 1 to 4. The player positions the arrow in a direction of his choosing in the center of the board. When subsequent marbles are placed, all marbles currently on the board will move in the direction of their arrow the distance identified by their printed value.

Players must play at least one, and at most two, tiles per turn. If a player plays a marble on her first turn, she immediately takes a second turn, playing another marble or a Machine Tile (A machine Part of Modifier).

The game ends when there are no tiles left for a player to draw or a player has met the specified marble quota for the game. This triggers the final phase, in which the machine keeps running until all of the marbles on the board reach their final destination. After the final phase, the player with the most marbles wins the game.
